&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 511-A:3 Hearing by Court. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When a defendant objects to the making of attachments, the court shall set a hearing on such objection within 14 days of the receipt of such objection.  Upon hearing, the burden shall be upon the plaintiff to show that there is a reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff will recover judgment including interest and costs on any amount equal to or greater than the amount of the attachment.  Upon satisfying said burden, the plaintiff shall be entitled to the attachment unless the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the court that his assets will be sufficient to satisfy such judgment with interest and costs if the plaintiff recovers same.  Such hearings shall not be bound by the rules of evidence.  The court may appoint such masters, referees or magistrates as may be necessary to conduct such hearings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 511-A:5 Filing Attachments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The order of the court may be filed with the register of deeds as to real estate or with the secretary of state as to personal property, by the plaintiff or his attorney, without further notice to the defendant.  Where notice of such order needs to be given to any trustee, such order shall be served upon the trustee in such manner as may be prescribed by rules of the superior court.  Such attachments shall be effective against any trustee, the defendant and all others, except bona fide purchasers for value, as of the time of service or as ordered by the court.  Such attachments shall not be effective against bona fide purchasers for value until attachments of real estate have been recorded in the registry of deeds for the county or counties in which the real estate lies or until other attachments are filed with the secretary of state.  Fees payable for such recordings or filings shall be in accordance with RSA 478:17-g.  As between attaching creditors, all attachments made in conformity with this chapter shall have priority in the order of service of notice on the defendant as provided by RSA 511-A:2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 511-A:8 Exceptions Prior to Hearing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon application to the court, in exceptional circumstances, an attachment may be ordered in advance of notice to the defendant if the plaintiff establishes probable cause to the satisfaction of the court of his basic right to recovery and the amount thereof and in addition thereto the existence of any of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is substantial danger the property sought to be attached will be damaged, destroyed, concealed, or removed from the state and placed beyond the attachment jurisdiction of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An attachment is necessary to vest quasi in rem jurisdiction of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In equity cases for specific performance of an agreement to transfer land or a unique chattel, there is imminent danger of transfer to a bona fide third party.  In such land cases, as well as those to perfect a labor and materials lien under RSA 447, a writ of attachment may be filed at a registry of deeds without prior application and notice, provided said writ is in the form of a lis pendens and specifically restricts its application to the particular real estate described in the writ and the return of attachment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An attachment is necessary to prevent the absolute vesting of title in a purchaser upon the imminent expiration of the notice period under a bulk sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest, or when other exceptional circumstances are established to the satisfaction of the court.
<br>
In all cases of attachment made ex parte the court may impose reasonable conditions thereon and a hearing shall be granted as promptly as possible upon the subsequent request of a defendant.
