&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 512:3 Writ. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The trustee writ shall be an attachment and summons, and shall be served upon the defendant and trustee like a writ of summons, and the goods and estate of the defendant may be attached thereon.  Concurrently therewith, the trustee shall be served with a trustee disclosure form in compliance with RSA 512:9-d.  The first page of the attachment shall bear a notice in boldface, in at least 12-point type, advising the trustee to complete and file the enclosed disclosure of trustee form with the court, the plaintiff, and the defendant within 30 days of receipt or suffer the risk of default.  Return of the trustee disclosure form shall operate as an answer and an appearance on behalf of the trustee.  A corporation summoned as trustee may appear and answer through its cashier, treasurer, clerk, or such other officer or employee as it shall appoint.
