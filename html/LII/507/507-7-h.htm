&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 507:7-h Effect of Release or Covenant Not to Sue. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A release or covenant not to sue given in good faith to one of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury discharges that person in accordance with its terms and from all liability for contribution, but it does not discharge any other person liable upon the same claim unless its terms expressly so provide.  However, it reduces the claim of the releasing person against other persons by the amount of the consideration paid for the release.
