An action for recovery of damages, pursuant to this section, may be brought in small claims court if the total damages do not exceed the jurisdictional limit of such court, or in any other appropriate court.  The provisions of this section are in addition to other civil remedies and shall not limit the rights of merchants or other persons to elect to pursue other civil remedies.
