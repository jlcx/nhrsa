&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 507:7-d Comparative Fault. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Contributory fault shall not bar recovery in an action by any plaintiff or plaintiff's legal representative, to recover damages in tort for death, personal injury or property damage, if such fault was not greater than the fault of the defendant, or the defendants in the aggregate if recovery is allowed against more than one defendant, but the damages awarded shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of fault attributed to the plaintiff by general verdict.  The burden of proof as to the existence or amount of fault attributable to a party shall rest upon the party making such allegation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 507:7-e Apportionment of Damages. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In all actions, the court shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Instruct the jury to determine, or if there is no jury shall find, the amount of damages to be awarded to each claimant and against each defendant in accordance with the proportionate fault of each of the parties;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of the rules of joint and several liability, except that if any party shall be less than 50 percent at fault, then that party's liability shall be several and not joint and he shall be liable only for the damages attributable to him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) RSA 507:7-e, I(b) notwithstanding, in all cases where parties are found to have knowingly pursued or taken active part in a common plan or design resulting in the harm, grant judgment against all such parties on the basis of the rules of joint and several liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In all actions, the damages attributable to each party shall be determined by general verdict, unless the parties agree otherwise, or due to the presence of multiple parties or complex issues the court finds the use of special questions necessary to the determination.  In any event, the questions submitted to the jury shall be clear, concise, and as few in number as practicable, and shall not prejudice the rights of any party to a fair trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For purposes of contribution under RSA 507:7-f and RSA 507:7-g, the court shall also determine each defendant's proportionate share of the obligation to each claimant in accordance with the verdict and subject to any reduction under RSA 507:7-i.  Upon motion filed not later than 60 days after final judgment is entered, the court shall determine whether all or part of a defendant's proportionate share of the obligation is uncollectible from that defendant and shall reallocate any uncollectible amount among the other defendants according to their proportionate shares.  The party whose liability is reallocated is nonetheless subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the claimant on the judgment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to modify or limit the duties, responsibilities, or liabilities of any party for personal injury or property damage arising from pollutant contamination, containment, cleanup, removal or restoration as established under state public health or environmental statutes including, but not limited to, RSA 146-A, RSA 147-A and RSA 147-B.

<center><h3>Section 507:7-f</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 507:7-f Contribution Among Tortfeasors. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, a right of contribution exists between or among 2 or more persons who are jointly and severally liable upon the same indivisible claim, or otherwise liable for the same injury, death or harm, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or any of them.  Except as provided in RSA 507:7-g, I and IV, the right of contribution may be enforced only by a separate action brought for that purpose.  The basis for contribution is each person's share of the obligation, including the proportionate share of the claimant at fault as determined in accordance with the provisions of RSA 507:7-e.  No right of contribution exists against a person who is immune to the claim which would otherwise give rise to a right of contribution.  No right of contribution exists against the claimant at fault.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Contribution is not available to a person who enters into a settlement with a claimant unless the settlement extinguishes the liability of the person from whom contribution is sought, and then only to the extent that the amount paid in settlement was reasonable.

<center><h3>Section 507:7-g</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 507:7-g Enforcement of Contribution. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the proportionate fault of the parties to a claim for contribution has been established as provided in RSA 507:7-e, a party paying more than its proportionate share of the obligation may recover judgment for contribution upon motion in the same action, or by separate action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the proportionate fault of the parties to the claim for contribution has not been established, contribution may be enforced in a separate action, whether or not a judgment has been rendered against either the person seeking contribution or the person from whom contribution is being sought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a judgment has been rendered, the action for contribution must be commenced within one year after the judgment becomes final.  If no judgment has been rendered, the person bringing the action for contribution must have either (a) discharged by payment the common liability within the period of the statute of limitations applicable to the claimant's right of action against that person and commenced the action for contribution within one year after payment, or (b) agreed while action was pending to discharge the common liability and, within one year after the agreement, have paid liability and commenced an action for contribution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All such claims for contribution shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof except as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A party seeking contribution by separate action may at the outset elect to have the contribution action heard in a court of competent jurisdiction by filing an action in court;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A party against whom contribution is sought in a separate action may, within 60 days of receiving notice by certified mail of a demand for arbitration, elect to have the contribution action heard by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Such election shall be made by notice by regular mail to the party seeking contribution or his counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and only if the plaintiff in the principal action agrees, a defendant seeking contribution may bring an action in contribution prior to the resolution of the plaintiff's principal action, and such action shall be consolidated for all purposes with the principal action.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 507:7-h Effect of Release or Covenant Not to Sue. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A release or covenant not to sue given in good faith to one of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury discharges that person in accordance with its terms and from all liability for contribution, but it does not discharge any other person liable upon the same claim unless its terms expressly so provide.  However, it reduces the claim of the releasing person against other persons by the amount of the consideration paid for the release.

Evidence of a settlement with, or the giving of a release or covenant not to sue to, one or more persons liable for the same injury shall not be introduced in evidence in a trial by jury of an action against another person to recover damages for the same injury.  However, upon return of a verdict for the plaintiff by the jury in any such trial, the court shall inquire of counsel the amount of consideration paid for any such settlement, release, or covenant not to sue, and shall reduce the plaintiff's verdict by that amount.
