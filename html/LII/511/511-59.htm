&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 511:59 Absence of Receiptor. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever a receiptor for property attached is absent from the county of his residence, the officer holding the receipt may make a demand upon him for the property by leaving a notice in writing at the last and usual place of abode of the receiptor, directed to him, signed by the officer, and containing a statement of the kind and amount of property for which the receipt was given, the names of the parties to the writ on which it was attached, and the time when and place where the officer requires it to be delivered.  A demand so made shall charge the receiptor as if it were made upon him in person.
