<codesect>
If an excessive or unreasonable attachment of any kind, by trustee process or otherwise, has been made on mesne process, the defendant may apply to the superior court to have the amount of the attachment reduced or to have it discharged.  Upon such application, the party making the attachment shall have the burden of proof to show that the attachment is not excessive or unreasonable.  If, on hearing, the court shall find that the attachment is excessive or unreasonable under all the circumstances, it shall order the reduction or discharge of the attachment as justice may require.  The findings and order of the court under this section shall be inadmissible in evidence for any purpose at any other stage of the cause.
