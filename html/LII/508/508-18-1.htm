I. No health care facility licensed under RSA 151, licensed physician, registered nurse, certified physician's assistant or qualified medical technician or medical technologist ordered by a law enforcement officer to perform a test, medical examination or procedure on a person in the custody of such officer, shall be held liable for any damage arising out of the performance of such test, examination, or procedure, if the test, examination, or procedure is performed with ordinary care.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to legalize an otherwise illegal test, examination or procedure insofar as the law enforcement agency and any employee thereof is concerned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of this section, "health care facility'' means hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, specialty hospitals, and licensed nursing homes including all services and property owned by such.  Health care facilities shall include facilities which are publicly or privately owned or for-profit or not-for-profit, and which are licensed or required to be licensed in whole or in part by the state.
