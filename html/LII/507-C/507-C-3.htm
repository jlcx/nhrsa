&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 507-C:3 Qualified Testimony. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In any action for medical injury:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No witness is competent to give the expert testimony required by RSA 507-C:2 unless the court finds that the witness was competent and duly qualified to render or supervise equivalent care to that which is alleged to have caused the medical injury at the time that such care was rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No witness whose compensation for his services is in any way dependent on the outcome of the case shall be permitted to give the expert testimony required by RSA 507-C:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No medical care provider shall be required to give expert opinion testimony against himself or herself as to any of the matters set forth in RSA 507-C:2.  However, this prohibition does not apply if the medical care provider has previously and voluntarily given such expert opinion testimony favorable to himself or herself at the trial.
