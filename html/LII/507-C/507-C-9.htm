<i>RSA 507-C has been held unconstitutional in the case of Carson v. Maurer (1980) 120 N.H. 925, 424 A.2d 825.  Community Resources for Justice, Inc. v. City of Manchester (2007) 154 N.H. 748, 917 A.2d 707, overrules Carson v. Maurer to the extent that it did not employ the new middle tier scrutiny standard articulated in Community Resources for Justice, Inc. v. City of Manchester.</i>
