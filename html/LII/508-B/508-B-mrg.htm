&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 508-B:1 Payment:  Not to Imply Liability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No advance payment or partial payment of damages made by any person, or made by his insurer under liability insurance, as an accommodation to an injured person or on his behalf to others or to the heirs at law or dependents of a deceased person, because of a personal injury or death claim or potential claim against any person or insured shall be construed as an admission of liability by the person claimed against, or as a recognition by such person or by his insurer of such liability, with respect to such injured or deceased person or with respect to any other claim arising from the same accident or event.  Any such payments shall, however, constitute a credit against and be deducted from any final settlement made or judgment rendered with respect to such injured or deceased person which does not expressly provide to the contrary.
