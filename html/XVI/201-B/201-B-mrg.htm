<center><h3>Section 201-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 201-B:1 Compact Enacted. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The Interstate Library Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
<center>
<p>
<b>Article I</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Policy and Purpose</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities;  to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.
