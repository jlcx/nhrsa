&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 201-B:4 Eligibility for Aid. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
An interstate library district lying partly within this state may claim and be entitled to receive state aid in support of any of its functions to the same extent and in the same manner as such functions are eligible for support when carried on by entities wholly within this state.  For the purposes of computing and apportioning state aid to an interstate library district, this state will consider that portion of the area which lies within this state as an independent entity for the performance of the aided function or functions and compute and apportion the aid accordingly.  Subject to any applicable laws of this state, such a district also may apply for and be entitled to receive any federal aid for which it may be eligible.
