&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 202-A:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Mindful that, as the constitution declares, "knowledge and learning, generally diffused through a community'' are "essential to the preservation of a free government'' the legislature recognizes its duty to encourage the people of New Hampshire to extend their education during and beyond the years of formal education.  To this end, it hereby declares that the public library is a valuable supplement to the formal system of free public education and as such deserves adequate financial support from government at all levels.

The following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such warrant article to be voted on shall read:  "Shall the town accept the provisions of RSA 202-A:4-c providing that any town at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing indefinitely, until specific rescission of such authority, the public library trustees to apply for, accept and expend, without further action by the town meeting, unanticipated money from a state, federal or other governmental unit or a private source which becomes available during the fiscal year?''

III. (a) For unanticipated moneys in the amount of $5,000 or more, the public library trustees shall hold a prior public hearing on the action to be taken.  Notice of the time, place, and subject of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the relevant municipality at least 7 days before the hearing is held.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The public library trustees may establish the amount of unanticipated funds required for notice under this subparagraph, provided such amount is less than $5,000.  For unanticipated moneys in an amount less than $5,000, the public library trustees shall post notice of the moneys in the agenda, if any, and shall include notice in the minutes of the public library trustees meeting in which such moneys are discussed.

(e) Upon the ballot containing the question shall be printed the word "Yes'' with a square near it at the right hand of the question;  and immediately below the word "Yes'' shall be printed the word "No'' with a square near it at the right hand of the question.
