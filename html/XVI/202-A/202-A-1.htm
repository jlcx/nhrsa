&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 202-A:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Mindful that, as the constitution declares, "knowledge and learning, generally diffused through a community'' are "essential to the preservation of a free government'' the legislature recognizes its duty to encourage the people of New Hampshire to extend their education during and beyond the years of formal education.  To this end, it hereby declares that the public library is a valuable supplement to the formal system of free public education and as such deserves adequate financial support from government at all levels.
