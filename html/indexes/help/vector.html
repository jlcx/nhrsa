<h1 align="center"><u>Vector-space queries</u></h1>
<p>Vector-space queries return documents that match a list of words and phrases.
Documents returned by vector-space queries do not necessarily match every term
in the query. The rank of each document indicates how well the document matched
the query.</p>
<p>You can assign weighting factors to control the relative importance of terms
in the ranking of results. Weights can range from 0.0 to 1.0. For example, in
the vector-space query <b>light, bulb</b>, both terms have equal weight in the
ranking of results. In the query: <b>{weight value=.3} light, {weight value=.1}
bulb,<br>
{weight value=.6} light bulb</b>, the term &quot;light&quot; is three times more
important than the term &quot;bulb,&quot; and the phrase &quot;light bulb&quot;
is twice as important as the term &quot;light.&quot; If no weight is specified,
Indexing Service uses a weight of 1.0 by default. For more information about
term weighting, see <a href="termweighting.html" id="specLoc">Term weighting</a>.</p>
<p>The following table shows examples of vector queries.</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td bgcolor="#EAEAEA"><b>light, bulb</b></td>
      <td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">Documents with one or both of the words you are
        searching for. Documents containing both words are ranked higher than
        those containing only one.</td>
    </tr>

      <td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">Documents that contain prefixes, words, and phrases</td>
      <td bgcolor="#EAEAEA"><b>invent*, {weight value=.3} light, {weight

      <td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">Documents that contain words prefixed by
        &quot;invent,&quot; the words &quot;light,&quot; &quot;bulb,&quot; and
        the phrase &quot;light bulb.&quot; Documents that contain the word
        &quot;light&quot; are ranked higher than those that contain the word
        &quot;bulb,&quot; but lower than those that contain the phrase
        &quot;light bulb.&quot;</td>

<p>Following is an example of a long-form vector-space query:</p>
<p class="indent2"><b>{vector RankMethod = max} {ve} {weight value=.250}class {ve}
{weight value=.500}occurrence {ve} {weight value=1.000}cursor {/vector}</b></p>
<p>There is no short form for a vector-space query.</p>
<p>The <i>RankMethod</i> parameter specifies the ranking algorithm Indexing
Service uses to evaluate the rank of a query match. A query vector specification
must be closed with the <b>{/vector}</b> tag.</p>
<p>The <b>{ve}</b> (vector element) tag means that the following query
specification is an element of the vector query. All the text following the <b>{ve}</b>
tag up to the next <b>{ve}</b> tag is interpreted as a query. There is no
closing tag for <b>{ve}</b>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p class="indent2"><b>{vector RankMethod = &quot;Jaccard&quot;} {ve} {weight
value=0.200} @contents CONTAINS &quot;printers&quot; OR {coerce} &quot;print
driver&quot; {ve} {prop name=DocTitle} {freetext} Hewlett Packard HP laser jet
printer{/freetext}{/prop} {ve} @contents hang** {/vector}.</b></p>
