<h1 align="center"><u>Making queries</u></h1>
<p>Using queries, you can find documents by searching for words and phrases in
their contents or their properties, such as the document's name or author. The
simplest kind of query is a single word. For example, if you search for
&quot;operation,&quot; Indexing Service returns all documents that contain the
word &quot;operation&quot; in their contents.</p>
<p>You can also find documents that have property values that match a given
criterion. The properties you can query include basic document information, such
as document name and document size. You can also query on ActiveX properties,
such as the document summary. ActiveX properties are stored in documents created
by ActiveX-aware programs, such as Microsoft Office applications.</p>
<p>There are five kinds of queries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free-text queries
  <li>Phrase queries
  <li>Pattern-matching queries
  <li>Relational queries
  <li>Vector-space queries</li>
</ul>
