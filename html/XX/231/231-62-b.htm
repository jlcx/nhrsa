&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any annual town meeting under an article in the warrant placed there by petition or by the selectmen, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of having a 2 or 3-year term for each highway agent.  If the town has adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of increasing the term of a town highway agent from one (2) year(s) to 2 (3) years, beginning with the term of each town highway agent who shall be elected at next year's regular town meeting or appointed by the selectmen elected at said meeting?''  Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of a 2 or 3-year term at the next annual meeting after the vote of approval, the town shall elect or provide for the appointment of one or more highway agents for the longer term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After a 2 or 3-year term for town highway agent has been established, at any annual town meeting held the year before the end of the 2 or 3-year term, under an article in the warrant placed there by petition or by the selectmen, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of continuing to have the longer term for each town highway agent.  If the town has adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of reducing the term of a town highway agent from 2 (3) years to 1 (2) year(s), beginning with the term of each town highway agent who shall be elected at next year's regular town meeting or appointed by the selectmen elected at said meeting?''  Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question do not vote in favor of continuing the longer term, at the next annual town meeting, the voters shall elect or provide for the appointment of one or more highway agents under RSA 231:62 for shorter terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of this section shall apply to any town having a population of 4,500 inhabitants or over.
