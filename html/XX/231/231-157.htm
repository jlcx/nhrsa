&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:157 Scenic Roads;  Designation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any road in a town, other than a class I or class II highway, may be designated as a scenic road in the following manner.  Upon petition of 10 persons who are either voters of the town or who own land which abuts a road mentioned in the petition (even though not voters of the town), the voters of such town at any annual or special meeting may designate such road as a scenic road.  Such petitioners shall be responsible for providing the town clerk with a list of known property owners whose land abuts any of the roads mentioned in the petition.  The town clerk shall notify by regular mail within 10 days of the filing all abutters along the road that lies within the town that a scenic road petition has been filed for and that an article to designate such road as a scenic road will appear in the warrant at the next town meeting.  The voters at a regular town meeting may rescind in like manner their designation of a scenic road upon petition as provided above.  Notice to the abutting landowners shall also be given as provided above.  Each town shall maintain and make available to the public a list of all roads or highways or portions thereof within the town which have been designated as scenic roads.  Such list shall be kept current by updating not less than annually and shall contain sufficient information to permit ready identification of the location and extent of each scenic road or portion thereof, by reference to a town map or otherwise.
