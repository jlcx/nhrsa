I. At any annual town meeting under an article in the warrant placed there by petition or by the selectmen, the voters may vote, by ballot, to determine if they are in favor of having a 2 or 3-year term for each town highway agent.  If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of a longer term, at the next annual meeting after the vote of approval, the town shall choose, by ballot, or the selectmen shall appoint, one or more town agents for the designated term of years.

II. After a 2 or 3-year term for town highway agent has been established, at any annual town meeting held the year before the end of the 2 or 3-year term, under an article in the warrant placed there by petition or by the selectmen, the voters may vote, by ballot, to determine if they are in favor of continuing to have a 2 or 3-year term for each town highway agent.  The voters may choose to return to a one-year term as provided in RSA 231:62 or to increase the term from 2 years to 3 years as provided in paragraph I or to reduce the term from 3 years to 2 years as provided in paragraph I.
