<codesect>
A municipality may contract with any owner of land abutting a public highway to cut, trim, and improve the roadside growth along said owner's property, and for all such work properly done in carrying out the provisions of RSA 231:150 and approved by the tree wardens, may allow and cause to be paid to such owner such sums as in their judgment, with the advice of the tree wardens, justly represent the value to the town of the improved condition of the roadside.
