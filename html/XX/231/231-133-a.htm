<codesect>
The governing body may adopt a system for assigning or altering address numbers of buildings and other property along any public or private way in the municipality.  Prior to the actual assignation or alteration of numbers along any way or portion of any way the governing body or planning board shall hold a public hearing for which 10 days' notice has been given by posting in 2 public places in the municipality, by publication in a newspaper in circulation in the municipality, and by first class mail to all owners of property being numbered or renumbered, as indicated by town records.  No public hearing shall be required where the property owner or owners voluntarily consent to their property being numbered or renumbered, as indicated by town records.  Each municipality addressing numbers on streets and highways pursuant to this section is encouraged to notify the bureau of emergency communications of the changes in accordance with RSA 106-H:10.
