I. All such highways shall be deemed subject to gates and bars;  provided, however, that any gates or bars maintained by private land owners shall be erected so as not to prevent or interfere with public use of the highway, and shall be capable of being opened and reclosed by highway users.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:22-a Reclassifying a Class VI Highway. &#150;</b>

I. A class VI highway or portion thereof may be reclassified by vote of the town as a class V highway, or as a class IV highway if located within the compact sections of cities and towns as set forth in RSA 229:5, IV and V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The warrant article for such a reclassification may be inserted either by the selectmen pursuant to RSA 39:2, or by petition pursuant to RSA 39:3.  The reclassification shall become effective upon a majority vote of the registered voters present and voting at any annual or special meeting, or at such later time as may be specified by vote of the meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any class VI highway may be made subject to reclassification under this section, regardless of whether such class VI status resulted from a layout pursuant to RSA 231:21, a discontinuance subject to gates and bars pursuant to RSA 231:45, or by the failure of the town to maintain and repair such highway in suitable condition for travel thereon for 5 successive years or more as set forth in RSA 229:5, VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A town meeting vote to reclassify a class VI highway under this section may provide that the highway be conditionally reclassified upon compliance with betterment assessments, as provided in RSA 231:28-33, even if such condition was not stated as part of the warrant article.  The public hearing required by RSA 231:28 shall be held within 90 days of such a vote, or within such longer period as the vote may specify.  The owners of property abutting or served by the highway shall have the same rights and remedies as provided in RSA 231:28-33, including the right to submit, within 10 days following the public hearing, a petition not to conditionally reclassify the highway.  The costs assessed against the owners by the selectmen shall not reflect construction standards any higher or more stringent than those reflected in the best town highway giving access to the highway or portion thereof being reclassified.  However, this paragraph shall not be deemed to limit the authority of the planning board to impose more stringent construction standards as a condition of approving new development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. This section shall not be deemed to limit the authority of the selectmen to layout an existing class VI highway as a class IV or V highway upon petition pursuant to RSA 231:8.  This section shall not affect the classification of any highway which has been reclassified by other means prior to June 18, 1990.

I. Notwithstanding RSA 231:59 or any other provision of law, a town may raise and appropriate, and the selectmen may expend, money for the repair of any class VI highway or private way which has been declared an emergency lane under paragraph II.  Such repair may include removal of brush, repair of washouts or culverts, or any other work deemed necessary to render such way passable by firefighting equipment and rescue or other emergency vehicles.  A capital reserve fund under RSA 35 or a trust fund under RSA 31:19-a may be established for this purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No expenditures shall be made under paragraph I unless the selectmen, following a public hearing, declare the relevant class VI highway, private way, or portion thereof, as an emergency lane, and make written findings, recorded in the minutes of the meeting, that the public need for keeping such lane passable by emergency vehicles is supported by an identified public welfare or safety interest which surpasses or differs from any private benefits to landowners abutting such lane.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of a private way, notice shall be mailed to all persons known to have a legal interest in the way, 10 days prior to the hearing, and the emergency lane shall not be declared if permission is denied by any person with a legal right to deny such permission.  Neither the appearance nor non-appearance of such persons at the hearing shall prevent such permission from later being denied or withdrawn.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A declaration under this section may be rescinded or disregarded at any time without notice.  This section shall not be construed to create any duty or liability on the part of any municipality toward any person or property.  Utilization of this section shall be at the sole and unfettered discretion of a town and its officials, and no landowner or any other person shall be entitled to damages by virtue of the creation of emergency lanes, or the failure to create them, or the maintenance of them, or the failure to maintain them, and no person shall be deemed to have any right to rely on such maintenance.  This section shall not be deemed to alter the classification or legal status of any highway or private way, or to limit or restrict the authority of towns to regulate the use of class VI highways pursuant to such statutes as RSA 41:11, RSA 236:9--13, and RSA 674:41, or to authorize any person to pass over any private way when permission has been denied.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:75 Damages From Grade or Drainage Change;  Assessment by Selectmen. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If in repairing a highway by the authority of the town the grade is raised or lowered, or a ditch made at the side thereof, or a new culvert, ditch, or other drainage structure is installed, or alterations are made to any existing culvert, ditch, or drainage structure, whereby damage is occasioned to any estate adjoining or not adjoining said highway, the determination of the amount of damages, if any, due to an aggrieved owner shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The selectmen or their designee shall, at least 30 days prior to commencement of the work, give notice by certified mail, in the manner set forth in RSA 231:9, to adjoining landowners and any other owners whose land might reasonably be anticipated to be affected, describing the work to be performed, and setting forth a place and time, at least 15 days after the mailing of said notice, but prior to the commencement of the work, at which said owners may be heard by the selectmen;  provided however that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No such notice shall be required in cases where none of the work is proposed to be done outside the limits of the highway right-of-way, and such work consists solely of (i) maintenance grading, or the cleaning or repairing of existing ditches, or (ii) the repairing or replacing of existing culverts or drainage structures without altering their size, depth, or positioning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the event of an emergency rendering the highway "insufficient'' as defined in RSA 231:90, II, and where exigent repair is deemed imperative by the selectmen, the time limits set forth above need not be strictly observed;  however such notice and opportunity for hearing shall be given to the greatest extent which is reasonable and practical under the circumstances, and the selectmen's minutes shall describe the nature of the emergency and the need for exigent repair.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The selectmen shall hear any owner desiring to be heard, either at a hearing noticed under paragraph I, or otherwise within 30 days after receiving a hearing request from an aggrieved owner.  If an aggrieved owner applies for damages, the selectmen shall view the premises and assess the damages, if any, within 30 days of said hearing or within 30 days after the completion of the work, whichever is later, and shall file a record of their proceedings in the office of the town clerk.  In assessing damages, any benefit which the landowner may receive by such repairs may be set off against the owner's claim.  A hearing request made under this paragraph shall be made within 6 months following the completion of the work, and not afterward.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. So long as the procedures set forth in paragraphs I and II are followed, the pendency of proceedings under this section shall not be deemed to require any delay in, or modification of, the proposed work, unless so ordered by the selectmen or by a restraining order issued by the superior court.

I. If an owner is aggrieved by a decision of the selectmen under RSA 231:75, such owner may appeal to the superior court in accordance with the appeals of highway layout decisions, as set forth in RSA 231:34.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The question of the public need for the change of grade or drainage, and the reasonableness of the methods chosen shall be reviewed by the court only for an abuse of discretion, and there shall be no right to a jury trial on that question.  The amount of damages, if any, shall be determined by jury, or by trial without jury if jury trial is waived.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. So long as the notice provisions in RSA 231:75 have been followed, the remedy provided in this subdivision shall be the exclusive remedy to a landowner aggrieved by a change in grade or drainage made by a town in the repair of a town highway.  This subdivision shall be deemed an exception to the otherwise-applicable limits on municipal liability arising from repair of public highways, as set forth in RSA 231:92.

The notice shall be signed and shall set forth in general terms of the location of such highway, bridge, or sidewalk and the nature of such insufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of this subdivision, a highway or sidewalk shall be considered "insufficient'' only if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It is not passable in any safe manner by those persons or vehicles permitted on such sidewalk or highway by state law or by any more stringent local ordinance or regulation;  or

III. A highway or sidewalk shall not, in the absence of impassability or hidden hazard as set forth in paragraph II, be considered "insufficient'' merely by reason of the municipality's failure to construct, maintain or repair it to the same standard as some other highway or sidewalk, or to a level of service commensurate with its current level of public use.

II. Any action to recover damages for bodily injury, personal injury or property damage arising out of municipal construction, repair or maintenance of its public highways or sidewalks constructed on such highways shall be dismissed unless the complaint describes with particularity the means by which the municipality received actual notice of the alleged insufficiency, or the intentional act which created the alleged insufficiency.

<codesect>
It is hereby found and declared:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. That the free circulation of traffic of all kinds through the streets of the municipalities of this state is necessary for the rapid and effective fighting of fires, disposition of police forces, and transit of other emergency vehicles in said municipalities for the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the public, whether residing in or traveling to, through or from said municipalities in the course of lawful pursuits as well as for the sound economic development of such municipalities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. That in recent years the parking of motor vehicles of all kinds on the streets of said municipalities has so substantially impeded such free circulation of traffic as to constitute at the present time a public nuisance endangering the health, safety, morals and welfare of the general public, as well as endangering the economic life of said municipalities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. That such traffic congestion cannot be adequately abated except by provisions for sufficient off-street parking facilities;  and that the enactment of laws to so provide off-street parking facilities is therefore a necessity in the public interest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:116 Plan. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When the legislative body of any municipality finds that the public health, safety, morals and general welfare so requires, it may undertake to study the question of providing public parking facilities.  For the purpose of such study said legislative body may appoint or authorize its governing board to appoint an investigative and planning board or may contract with private planners or developers which investigative and planning board or private party shall study the parking needs and conditions in said municipality and shall propose a plan for providing one or more public parking facilities;  and said legislative body may appropriate such sums of money as are reasonably necessary therefor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The plan referred to in paragraph I of this section, in addition to providing a detailed proposal for the construction of one or more public parking facilities shall show that there is a need for public parking facilities, that the facilities proposed therein are proposed with respect to that need, and shall include an estimate of construction costs and operating expenses and the method of financing and paying the same.  Any such plan shall provide that construction costs or operating expenses shall be raised by assessments as provided in RSA 231:120 and the plan shall so indicate and shall determine the boundaries of any prescribed area within which special benefit assessments shall be levied, which area may but need not be coterminous with the municipality.  No such plan shall be adopted unless it provides that at least 50 percent of the construction costs and operating expenses shall be raised by assessments upon the owners or lessees of leasehold interests whose lands receive special benefits therefrom and such plan shall also provide that no more than 25 percent of such construction costs and operating expenses shall be raised from general revenues and no more than 25 percent of such construction costs and operating expenses shall be raised from motor vehicle permit fees as provided in RSA 261:154.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The legislative body of a municipality may adopt the proposed plan with or without amendment and proceed with the construction of the public parking facilities.  Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the municipality from thereafter changing or amending the plan upon a finding by the legislative body that the public interest requires such change or amendment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:132-a Parking Enforcement Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a municipality which installs parking meters pursuant to RSA 231:130, or which establishes other parking restrictions pursuant to RSA 41:11 or 47:17, or which seeks to enforce the stopping, standing and parking restrictions set forth in RSA 265:68-74, may utilize the following provisions in the enforcement of such parking restrictions and parking charges established through parking meters:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All violations of such parking restrictions and charges shall be deemed the responsibility of the registered owner of the vehicle.  Such registration may be proven as set forth in RSA 261:60.  Such registered owner shall be conclusively presumed to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the parking violation, and no evidence of actual control or culpability need be proved as an element of the offense.  It shall be an affirmative defense that at the time of the infraction the vehicle was beyond the control of the registered owner as a result of a violation of RSA 262:12, 637:3 or 637:9 or a similar statute in another jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Municipalities may establish, by ordinance, systems for the administrative enforcement of parking violations and collection of penalties, to be utilized prior to the service of a formal summons and complaint.  Such a system may be administered by a police department or other municipal agency.  Such a system may include opportunities for persons who do not wish to contest parking violations to pay such penalties by mail.  Such a system may also provide for a schedule of enhanced penalties the longer such penalties remain unpaid;  provided, however, that the penalty for any separate parking offense shall in no case exceed the maximum penalty for a violation as set forth in RSA 651:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A written notice of violation containing a description of the parking offense and any applicable schedule of penalties, affixed to the vehicle at the time of the offense, shall be deemed adequate service of process on the vehicle owner for purposes of any administrative enforcement system established under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the administrative enforcement system established under paragraph II is unsuccessful at resolving alleged parking violations, or in the case of municipalities which have not established such a system, a summons may be issued as in the case of other violations of RSA title XXI, including the use of the procedure for plea by mail set forth in RSA 502-A:19-b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a complaint and summons for a parking offense may be served upon the defendant by postpaid certified mail, return receipt requested.  Return receipt showing that the defendant has received the complaint and summons shall constitute an essential part of the service.  If service cannot be effected by certified mail, then the court may direct that service on the defendant be completed as in other violation complaints.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In all towns, cities, and those village districts which maintain public highways, every highway and street under the control of the town, city, or village district shall have a name which shall be given it by the governing body.  Said name shall be legibly marked on a suitable signboard or other marker and placed in at least 2 conspicuous places on said street.  The governing body may change the name of any such street or highway at any time when in its judgment there is occasion for so doing.  The governing body may change the name of a private street or highway when the name change is necessary to conform to the requirements of the enhanced 911 telecommunications system.  In towns and village districts the governing body may at its discretion provide for public hearing and submit such names for approval at any meeting of the legislative body, and voters may submit a petitioned warrant article for such a name change under the procedure of RSA 39:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The naming of any new street or highway shall form a part of the return of the layout of the street or highway, or of the acceptance of any dedicated way.  The municipality shall not be bound by any name previously assigned to the street or highway by any private owner, developer, or dedicator.  No name for a highway or street shall be selected which is already in use, or which is confusingly similar to any such existing name, or which otherwise might delay the locating of any address in an emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever a name is assigned to any new street or highway, or a change is made in the name of any street or highway, the governing body shall make a return of the same to the town, city, or village district clerk, who shall make a record of the new name or name change, and shall forward a copy of such record to the commissioner of transportation.

Prior to the actual assignation or alteration of numbers along any way or portion of any way the governing body or planning board shall hold a public hearing for which 10 days' notice has been given by posting in 2 public places in the municipality, by publication in a newspaper in circulation in the municipality, and by first class mail to all owners of property being numbered or renumbered, as indicated by town records.  No public hearing shall be required where the property owner or owners voluntarily consent to their property being numbered or renumbered, as indicated by town records.

Failing in this, he or she may take said trees, including the right to maintain the same as shade trees, for the use of the town or city by appraising the fair value of the same and by causing to be served upon the owner thereof a notice of such taking, which notice shall state the number of each variety of tree so taken, the location of the same as near as practicable, and the value thereof as fixed by him or her, or by a committee selected for the purpose, and also by filing a copy of such notice as attested by him or her with the town clerk.  If the owner shall be satisfied with the value stated in such notice, the tree warden shall cause the same to be paid to him or her forthwith.  If the owner shall be dissatisfied, he or she may, within 30 days after said notice has been served upon him or her, but not afterwards, apply to the selectmen to assess his or her damages.  Such proceedings shall thereupon be had, including the right of appeal, as are provided in the case of assessment of damages in laying out of highways by selectmen;  and thereupon such damages, if any, may be awarded as shall be legally and justly due to the landowner.

After such declaration by such authority and notice to the abutting landowner on whose property such tree is located the said authority shall within a reasonable time remove the same without compensation or cost to the abutter.  However, no such declaration and notice shall be required when the delay entailed by such declaration and notice would pose an imminent threat to safety or property, including electric transmission and distribution lines.  Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to relieve the public utility companies of their accepted responsibility of tree trimming and tree removal for the protection of their lines, or for the construction of new lines, or to alter the provisions of RSA 231:150-182 in any manner.

<codesect>
Any road in a town, other than a class I or class II highway, may be designated as a scenic road in the following manner.  Upon petition of 10 persons who are either voters of the town or who own land which abuts a road mentioned in the petition (even though not voters of the town), the voters of such town at any annual or special meeting may designate such road as a scenic road.  Such petitioners shall be responsible for providing the town clerk with a list of known property owners whose land abuts any of the roads mentioned in the petition.  The town clerk shall notify by regular mail within 10 days of the filing all abutters along the road that lies within the town that a scenic road petition has been filed for and that an article to designate such road as a scenic road will appear in the warrant at the next town meeting.  The voters at a regular town meeting may rescind in like manner their designation of a scenic road upon petition as provided above.  Notice to the abutting landowners shall also be given as provided above.  Each town shall maintain and make available to the public a list of all roads or highways or portions thereof within the town which have been designated as scenic roads.  Such list shall be kept current by updating not less than annually and shall contain sufficient information to permit ready identification of the location and extent of each scenic road or portion thereof, by reference to a town map or otherwise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:158 Effect of Designation as Scenic Roads. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As used in this subdivision, "tree'' means any woody plant which has a circumference of 15 inches or more at a point 4 feet from the ground.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon a road being designated as a scenic road as provided in RSA 231:157, any repair, maintenance, reconstruction, or paving work done with respect thereto by the state or municipality, or any action taken by any utility or other person acting to erect, install or maintain poles, conduits, cables, wires, pipes or other structures pursuant to RSA 231:159-189 shall not involve the cutting, damage or removal of trees, or the tearing down or destruction of stone walls, or portions thereof, except with the prior written consent of the planning board, or any other official municipal body designated by the meeting to implement the provisions of this subdivision, after a public hearing duly advertised as to time, date, place and purpose, 2 times in a newspaper of general circulation in the area, the last publication to occur at least 7 days prior to such hearing, provided, however, that a road agent or his designee may, without such hearing, but only with the written permission of the selectmen, remove trees or portions of trees which have been declared a public nuisance pursuant to RSA 231:145 and 231:146, when such trees or portions of such trees pose an imminent threat to safety or property, and provided, further, that a public utility when involved in the emergency restoration of service, may without such hearing or permission of the selectmen, perform such work as is necessary for the prompt restoration of utility service which has been interrupted by facility damage and when requested, shall thereafter inform the selectmen of the nature of the emergency and the work performed, in such manner as the selectmen may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Designation of a road as scenic shall not affect the eligibility of the town to receive construction, maintenance or reconstruction aid pursuant to the provisions of RSA 235 for such road.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Designation of a road as a scenic road shall not affect the rights of any landowner with respect to work on his own property, except to the extent that trees have been acquired by the municipality as shade or ornamental trees pursuant to RSA 231:139-156, and except that RSA 472:6 limits the removal or alteration of boundary markers including stone walls.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A town may, as part of a scenic road designation under RSA 231:157 or as an amendment to such designation adopted in the same manner, impose provisions with respect to such road which are different from or in addition to those set forth in this section.  Such provisions may include, but are not limited to, decisional criteria for the granting of consent by the planning board or other designated municipal body under paragraph II, or protections for trees smaller than those described in paragraph I, designated for the purpose of establishing regenerative growth along the scenic road.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any person who violates this section or any local provision adopted under this section shall be guilty of a violation and shall be liable for all damages resulting therefrom.

<codesect>
Any such person, copartnership or corporation desiring to erect or install any such poles, structures, conduits, cables or wires in, under or across any such highway, shall secure a permit or license therefor in accordance with the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Town Maintained Highways.  Petitions for such permits or licenses concerning town maintained highways shall be addressed to the selectmen of the town in which such highway is located;  and they are hereby authorized to delegate all or any part of the powers conferred upon them by the provisions of this section to such agents as they may duly appoint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) City Maintained Highways.  Petitions for such permits or licenses concerning city maintained highways shall be addressed to the board of mayor and aldermen or board of mayor and council of the city in which such highway is located and they shall exercise the powers and duties prescribed in this subdivision for selectmen;  and they are hereby authorized to delegate all or any part of the powers conferred upon them by the provisions of this section to such agents as they may duly appoint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) State Maintained Highways.  Petitions for such permits or licenses concerning all class I and class III highways and state maintained portions of class II highways shall be addressed to the commissioner of transportation who shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the disposition of such petitions to the same effect as is provided for selectmen in other cases, and also shall have like jurisdiction for changing the terms of any such license or for assessing damages as provided herein.  The commissioner shall also have the same authority as conferred upon the selectmen by RSA 231:163 to revoke or change the terms and conditions of any such license.  The commissioner is hereby authorized to delegate all or any part of the powers conferred upon him by the provisions of this section to such agent or agents as he may duly appoint in writing;  he shall cause such appointments to be recorded in the office of the secretary of state, who shall keep a record thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The word "selectmen'' as used in the following paragraphs of this section shall be construed to include all those having jurisdiction over the issuance of permits or licenses under paragraph I hereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Permits.  The petitioner may petition such selectmen to grant a permit for such poles, structures, conduits, cables or wires.  If the public good requires, the selectmen shall grant a permit for erecting or installing and maintaining such poles, structures, conduits, cables or wires.  Such permit shall designate and define in a general way the location of the poles, structures, conduits, cables or wires described in the petition therefor.  Such permit shall be effective for such term as they may determine, but not exceeding one year from the date thereof, and may, upon petition, be extended for a further term not exceeding one year.  A permit shall not be granted to replace an existing utility pole on any public highway unless such replacement pole is erected at least 20 feet from the surfaced edge or the edge of public easement therein, provided, however, that for good cause shown the selectmen may waive the 20-foot requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Effect of Permit.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the holder of such permit shall during the term thereof be entitled to have and exercise all the rights, privileges and immunities and shall be subject to all the duties and liabilities granted or imposed hereby upon the holder of a license hereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Licenses.  The petitioner may petition such selectmen to grant a license for such poles, structures, conduits, cables or wires.  If the public good requires, the selectmen shall grant a license for erecting and installing or maintaining the poles, structures, conduits, cables or wires described in the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Provision of Licenses.  The selectmen in such license shall designate and define the maximum and minimum length of poles, the maximum and minimum height of structures, the approximate location of such poles and structures and the minimum distance of wires above and of conduits and cables below the surface of the highway, and in their discretion the approximate distance of such poles from the edge of the traveled roadway or of the sidewalk, and may include reasonable requirements concerning the placement of reflectors thereon.  Such designation and definition of location may be by reference to a map or plan filed with or attached to the petition or license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Effect of License.  All licenses granted under the provisions hereof shall be retroactive to the date the petition therefor is filed.  The word "license'' as hereinafter used herein, except in RSA 231:164 shall be construed to include the word "permit''.  The holder of such a license, hereinafter referred to as licensee, shall thereupon and thereafter be entitled to exercise the same and to erect or install and maintain any such poles, structures, conduits, cables, and wires in approximately the location designated by such license and to place upon such poles and structures the necessary and proper guys, cross-arms, fixtures, transformers and other attachments and appurtenances which are required in the reasonable and proper operation of the business carried on by such licensee, together with as many wires and cables of proper size and description as such poles and structures are reasonably capable of supporting during their continuance in service;  and to place in such underground conduits such number of ducts, wires and cables as they are designed to accommodate, and to supply and install in connection with such underground conduits and cables the necessary and proper manholes, drains, transformers and other accessories which may reasonably be required.

No licensee shall have the right to cut, prune, or remove any shade or ornamental tree, for the purpose of erecting or maintaining poles or structures or installing wires or other attachments or appurtenances thereto, without obtaining the consent of the owner of the land on which such tree grows.  The receipt of a license to erect and maintain such equipment pursuant to RSA 231:160 and RSA 231:160-a includes consent to cut, prune, or remove shade or ornamental trees growing on land located within the public right-of-way, or which may fall upon the right-of-way, that pose a danger to the reliability of equipment installed at or upon licensed utility facilities.  Nothing in this section shall affect the right of the landowner to the cordwood or timber that results from the activities of a licensee under this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A licensee shall provide notice in writing at least 45 days in advance of any non-emergency cutting, pruning, or removal of shade or ornamental trees that is scheduled to take place on a landowner's property.  The notice shall, at the option of the licensee, be given in person, or sent separately by ordinary mail, and not included in or as a part of a utility bill or other regular communication, to owners of affected land using the name and address that appears on municipal tax records for the property, or sent separately by electronic mail, and not included in or a part of a utility bill or other regular communication, if the landowner has established regular electronic mail communication with the licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The notice shall provide the name and contact information of a representative of the licensee who may be contacted to schedule personal consultation regarding the activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the purposes of this section, the owner shall be deemed to have consented to the activities if he or she fails to affirmatively request personal consultation within 45 days of the mailing of such notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If, after personal consultation with the licensee, the owner refuses to consent to the activities, the selectmen, upon petition, after notice to the owner and licensee, and hearing, shall determine whether the cutting, pruning, or removal is necessary and, if determined to be necessary, assess the damage to the owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon highways which have been designated scenic roads pursuant to RSA 231:157 and RSA 231:158, cutting, pruning, or removal shall be further restricted as set forth in those sections or any local provisions adopted thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require notice to or consent from the owner of land in the event that the owner, or a predecessor of the owner, has granted an easement which provides legal authority for the utility to remove, cut, prune, or trim trees or vegetation on the owner's land.

<center><h3>Section 231:190</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:190 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that important sectors of commerce of this state depend, in part, on the efficient vehicle transport of unprocessed natural resources, manufactured goods and other commercial products across class IV, V, and VI municipal roads.  The condition of such roads may at times necessitate that certain limits, seasonal or otherwise, as authorized in RSA 41:11, be placed upon the weight of vehicles that can safely pass across such roads, so as to avoid causing damage which may result in hazards to public safety or excessive municipal expense.  The general court urges municipalities to exercise this authority in ways that do not unreasonably infringe on the efficient movement of unprocessed natural resources, manufactured goods and other commercial products essential to a healthy state economy.

<center><h3>Section 231:191</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:191 Maximum Weight Limits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governing body of a municipality may establish maximum weight limits, seasonal or otherwise, which are more restrictive than limits set forth in RSA 266:17-26, for any class IV, V, or VI highway or portion of such highway, when the highway agent determines that such highway requires postings to prevent unreasonable damage or extraordinary municipal maintenance expense. Such posting shall be in accordance with currently acceptable practices and technology.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Maximum weight limits shall be posted, in the same manner as bridges are posted pursuant to RSA 234:39 and 266:18-c, at all entrances to the restricted highway or portion of such highway from other public highways.  Such signage shall be legible, posted in a conspicuous location, and be of weather resistant materials.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It shall be unlawful for any person to drive a vehicle in violation of such maximum weight limits without written permission provided in an expeditious manner from the selectmen or highway agent in a town, or the mayor and aldermen or street commissioner of a city.  The names of the officials authorized to grant written permission shall be posted prominently in the town office or city hall.  Officials authorized to grant written permission may impose reasonable conditions and may establish reasonable regulations for bonding and restoring the highway.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A person who violates such maximum weight limits shall be required to restore such highways if the municipality has reason to believe that the highway damage or disturbance is attributable to vehicles or activities under such person's control or responsibility.  Upon request, the municipality shall provide such person with the municipality's reasons, including any inspection reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No vehicle or commercial enterprise serviced by such vehicle shall be exempt from such maximum weight limits because of prior highway use or existing use of abutting land;  provided, however, that any owner of land or a commercial enterprise served by such highway, who demonstrates that such limits would entail practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, and who complies with all conditions and regulations concerning bonding and restoration, shall be granted an exemption unless the exemption would be detrimental to public safety.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "unnecessary hardship'' shall include any weight restriction which results in significant interference with a commercial enterprise or land use which existed prior to the posting of the weight restriction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any person who violates any provision of this section or the rules or regulations made under authority under this section shall be guilty of a violation if a natural person, or guilty of a misdemeanor if any other person;  and in addition, shall be liable for the cost of restoration of the highway to a condition satisfactory to the person empowered to give such written permission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The governing body of a municipality which establishes maximum weight limits more restrictive than the limits set forth in RSA 266:17-26, for any class IV, V, or VI highway or portion of such highway, seasonal or otherwise, which restricts a commercial or industrial company operated or located in that municipality, shall hold a hearing if requested by the impacted business.  The hearing shall be held within 15 working days of receipt of a certified letter by the local governing body from the impacted business requesting a hearing, otherwise enforcement of the maximum weight limits established by that municipality shall be suspended for the remainder of the year or until such hearing is held.
