<codesect>
If in repairing a highway by the authority of the town the grade is raised or lowered, or a ditch made at the side thereof, whereby damage is occasioned to land not adjoining such highway or to land in adjoining town, the owner of such land may petition the superior court for an assessment of damages;  and like proceedings shall be had thereon as in the case of laying out a highway by selectmen.  In assessing the damages any benefit which the landowner may receive by such repairs shall be set off against his claim.
