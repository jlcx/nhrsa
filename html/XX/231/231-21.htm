&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231:21 Gates and Bars. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any highway may be laid out subject to gates and bars across the same.  In such case it shall be determined, and the return of the selectmen shall state, by whom the gates and bars shall be maintained.  Whenever the public good requires it they may be removed and further damages assessed, upon like proceedings as in the laying out of highways.
