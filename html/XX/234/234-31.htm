Any municipality, upon a vote of approval at a town meeting or by city council, may recommend to the state historic preservation office that any unused covered wooden bridge over which it has jurisdiction be considered as an historic site and conveyed to the state of New Hampshire.  The state historic preservation officer shall solicit expert opinion from such sources as are available to him and hold a public hearing on the proposal.  Upon recommendation by the office and subject to approval by the governor and council, the municipality shall transfer and relinquish all rights and controls over said premises to the office.
