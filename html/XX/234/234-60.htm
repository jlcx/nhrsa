&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 234:60 Compact Amendment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, shall enter into, with the state of Maine, by and through the governor of the state of Maine, an agreement or compact substantially in the following form:
<center>
<p>
<b>COMPACT AMENDMENT</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the states of Maine and New Hampshire, with the express consent of the United States Congress, have entered into a compact creating the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority, which has resulted in the construction, operation, and maintenance of a bridge across the Piscataqua River between Kittery, Maine, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and its approach roads;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the United States Congress expressly reserved the right to alter or amend the provisions of this compact;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the condition of the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority highway and railroad bridge now serving vehicular and rail traffic over and across the Piscataqua River between the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine and the approaches to it have been deteriorating at an accelerated rate due to facility age, inflation, and effective declining revenues;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the present financial obligations of Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority for maintenance, operation, and repair of the bridge and its approaches have expanded to the extent that the Authority's financial resources face rapid depletion in the near future;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the states of Maine and New Hampshire do not have the financial resources to undertake the costs for proper maintenance, operations, and repair on the bridge and its approaches without cooperation with the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority's bridge and road facilities remain critical for national defense and interstate rail and highway transportation and commerce;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the realignment of various responsibilities between the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority and the states of New Hampshire and Maine will allow the Authority to continue to provide adequate highway and rail service for the citizens of both states while providing for the least burdensome financial impact upon the states;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the best remedy for the conditions now existing which would have the least long-term financial impact on the states of New Hampshire and Maine is to transfer some of the responsibility of the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority to the states;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, such a result can best be accomplished through the joint cooperation of the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority and the states of Maine and New Hampshire to effectuate such a transfer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Now, therefore, the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority and the states of New Hampshire and Maine do hereby agree and pledge each to the other as follows:
