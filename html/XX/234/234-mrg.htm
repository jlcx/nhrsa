&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 234:43 Compact. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, shall appoint 3 persons resident in this state, as commissioners upon the part of the state of New Hampshire to enter into, with the state of Maine, by and through the commissioners who may be appointed under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Maine, an agreement or compact in the form following, that is to say:
<center>
<p>
<b>COMPACT</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the single highway bridge serving as the sole facility for vehicular traffic over and across the Piscataqua river between the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine is wholly inadequate to care for and accommodate such traffic over said river between the said 2 states and therefore causes such traffic congestion in and upon the streets and highways of the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the town of Kittery, Maine, that the lives and property of the citizens of said communities and the travelers on said streets and highways are constantly endangered;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the antiquated and obsolete wooden pile bridge serving as the sole facility for railroad traffic over and across the Piscataqua river between the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine is wholly inadequate to care for and accommodate the railroad traffic between the said 2 states;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the narrow draw-span of said wooden pile railroad bridge, the sole facility permitting passage of water traffic up and down said river, is wholly inadequate to permit the passage of steamers and vessels of broad beam from the sea inland to serve the large industrial plants now situate on the banks of said river and therefore constitutes an obstacle to further en largement of these industries and the development of numerous other industrial sites located so that passage through said bridge is absolutely necessary;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the only remedy for the conditions now existing is the construction of a bridge across said river which by coordinating the facilities required by vehicular and railroad traffic will remove the obstacle to water traffic;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the solution of this problem will result in great economy and benefit not only to the states of Maine and New Hampshire but to the nation and will require the cordial cooperation of the states of New Hampshire and Maine in the encouragement of the investment of capital as well as the formulation and execution of the necessary plans and such result can best be accomplished through the joining of the 2 states of Maine and New Hampshire by and through a common agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Now therefore, the said states of New Hampshire and Maine do hereby agree and pledge each to the other as follows:
<center>
<p>

<codesect>
In the event that the Authority shall make default in the payment of principal or interest on any of the bonds after the same shall fall due and such default shall continue for a period of 60 days, or default in any agreement with the bondholders, the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the bonds then outstanding by instrument filed in the office of the secretary of state duly acknowledged, may appoint a trustee to represent the bondholders for the purpose herein provided.  Such trustee may, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in principal amount of the bonds then outstanding:  (1) by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce the rights of the bondholders;  (2) bring suit upon the bonds;  (3) enjoin any acts or other things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the bondholders;  (4) by notice in writing to the Authority declare all bonds due and payable and if all defaults shall be made good, to annul such declaration and its consequences;  (5) by action or suit in equity require the Authority to account as if it were trustee of an expressed trust for the stockholders.  Such trustee shall be entitled as a right to the appointment of a receiver who may to the extent that the Authority could itself do, enter and take possession of the facilities of the Authority or any part thereof, the revenue or receipts from which are or may be applicable to the payment of the bonds so in default, and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all revenue thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the Authority might do, and shall deposit all such monies in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court shall direct.  In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee, the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and the receiver, if any;  and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any revenues and receipts derived by the Authority, the revenues and receipts from which are or may be applicable to the payment of the bonds so in default.  Such trustee shall in addition to the foregoing have and possess all the powers necessary and appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the bondholders in the enforcement and protection of their rights.  In addition to other rights and limitations, any bondholder shall have the right by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding in law or in equity to enforce his rights against the Authority, including the right to require the Authority to carry out any agreement or covenant and to perform its duties under this subdivision.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 234:60 Compact Amendment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, shall enter into, with the state of Maine, by and through the governor of the state of Maine, an agreement or compact substantially in the following form:
<center>
<p>
<b>COMPACT AMENDMENT</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the states of Maine and New Hampshire, with the express consent of the United States Congress, have entered into a compact creating the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority, which has resulted in the construction, operation, and maintenance of a bridge across the Piscataqua River between Kittery, Maine, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and its approach roads;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the United States Congress expressly reserved the right to alter or amend the provisions of this compact;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the condition of the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority highway and railroad bridge now serving vehicular and rail traffic over and across the Piscataqua River between the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine and the approaches to it have been deteriorating at an accelerated rate due to facility age, inflation, and effective declining revenues;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the present financial obligations of Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority for maintenance, operation, and repair of the bridge and its approaches have expanded to the extent that the Authority's financial resources face rapid depletion in the near future;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the states of Maine and New Hampshire do not have the financial resources to undertake the costs for proper maintenance, operations, and repair on the bridge and its approaches without cooperation with the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority's bridge and road facilities remain critical for national defense and interstate rail and highway transportation and commerce;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the realignment of various responsibilities between the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority and the states of New Hampshire and Maine will allow the Authority to continue to provide adequate highway and rail service for the citizens of both states while providing for the least burdensome financial impact upon the states;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, the best remedy for the conditions now existing which would have the least long-term financial impact on the states of New Hampshire and Maine is to transfer some of the responsibility of the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority to the states;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whereas, such a result can best be accomplished through the joint cooperation of the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority and the states of Maine and New Hampshire to effectuate such a transfer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Now, therefore, the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority and the states of New Hampshire and Maine do hereby agree and pledge each to the other as follows:
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE I</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In this compact:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Main river structure'' means only that portion of the present Maine-New Hampshire interstate bridge authority facility which spans the Piscataqua River from the New Hampshire bridge abutment to the Maine bridge abutment, inclusive, for a distance of 2,880 feet or 0.5456 mile.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Approach roads'' means those roadway portions of the present Maine-New Hampshire interstate bridge authority facility known as the U.S. Route 1 Bypass running from the New Hampshire bridge abutment of the main river structure to the U.S. Route 1 Bypass/U.S. Route 1 junction in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a distance of approximately 2.79 miles, and running from the Maine bridge abutment of the main river structure to the U.S. Route 1 Bypass/U.S. Route 1 junction to Kittery, Maine, a distance of approximately 1.4 miles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Grade separation structures'' means 10 structures on the present Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority facility which allow the approach roads to pass either over or under predecessor facilities, namely, at Stark Street, U.S. Route 1, Maplewood Avenue, Middle Road, Hodgson Brook, Islington Street, and at the B and M Railroad, all located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and at Route 236, Eliot Road, and an abandoned railroad tunnel, located in Kittery, Maine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Authority'' means the Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Compact'' means the compact set forth in Maine Private and Special Laws, Ch. 18, Session of 1937 and New Hampshire RSA 234:43.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE II</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The Authority shall transfer the approach roads to the main river structure, all grade separation structures on the approach roads, and any of its real property incidental to present or future highway use to the respective states of Maine and New Hampshire.  The respective state transportation agencies shall thereafter assume the responsibility for the maintenance, operation, and repair of those grade separation structures and that segment of the approach roads which lie within the territorial limits of each state, except as set forth in Article III herein.  The Authority shall retain all responsibilities and obligations for the main river structure from the New Hampshire abutment to the Maine abutment, inclusive.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The Authority shall be responsible for providing Authority funds to be used in possible combination with federal aid funds through the states of New Hampshire and Maine for capital improvements to the main river structure as well as the transferred approach roads and grade separation structures.  The Authority's responsibility for capital improvements on the transferred approach roads and grade separation structures shall be limited to one major capital improvement for each grade separation structure and approach road segment.  The specific type of capital improvement and the timing for the performance of each improvement shall be determined by the Authority in conjunction with the joint findings of an annual inspection performed by engineering representatives of each state.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE IV</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Authority employees and their positions of employment shall be transferred to the Maine department of transportation and the New Hampshire department of transportation.  In effecting the transfer, the respective state transportation agencies shall endeavor to provide each transferred employee with comparable wages and benefits afforded similarly situated state employees.  For retirement benefit purposes, creditable service rendered by the employees shall be the same as if the employment had been rendered as a state employee.  If, after review by the board of trustees of the New Hampshire retirement system, it is determined that additional funds are required to finance in full the accrued retirement benefits for present and retired employees of the Authority, the Authority shall provide the funds necessary to fulfill this obligation within a period of time mutually agreeable to the Authority and board of trustees of the New Hampshire retirement system.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE V</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The Interstate Bridge Authority shall transfer its equipment necessary for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the transferred approach roads and grade separation structures to the New Hampshire department of transportation and the Maine department of transportation by mutual agreement.  The Authority shall contract with the states of Maine and New Hampshire for performance of necessary services on the roadway portion of the main river structure.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE VI</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The respective states and the Authority agree to and pledge, each to the other, continued faithful cooperation in both the implementation and execution of the provisions of this compact amendment in addition to the faithful cooperation for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the facility in the future.

<p>
<b>ARTICLE VII</b>

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The Authority's role is amended from operation of the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge to administration of funds for the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge and the I-95 High Level Bridge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The Authority is further authorized to pursue sustainable funding sources and properly administer and invest funds in a sinking fund for the construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge and the I-95 High Level Bridge (Piscataqua River Bridge), such construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation to be agreed upon by the states of New Hampshire and Maine.  The Authority shall serve as a financial vehicle to hold, invest, and distribute the sinking fund.  Funds received for the benefit of the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge or the I-95 High Level Bridge shall be deposited with the Authority and invested in a separate sinking fund, said funds to be continuously appropriated and nonlapsing, and shall be expended by the Authority for the construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of the main spans of the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge and the I-95 High Level Bridge.  In the event that sufficient funds are available, the Authority is authorized to use the funds for improvements to the bridge approach spans to the main spans of the 2 bridges.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The responsibilities of the Authority are further expanded to include the Memorial Bridge and the Authority shall facilitate cooperative solutions between the 2 states and coordinate the efforts of the respective states' transportation agencies in the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of the Memorial Bridge.
