&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 234:50 Rights of Bondholders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In the event that the Authority shall make default in the payment of principal or interest on any of the bonds after the same shall fall due and such default shall continue for a period of 60 days, or default in any agreement with the bondholders, the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the bonds then outstanding by instrument filed in the office of the secretary of state duly acknowledged, may appoint a trustee to represent the bondholders for the purpose herein provided.  Such trustee may, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in principal amount of the bonds then outstanding:  (1) by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce the rights of the bondholders;  (2) bring suit upon the bonds;  (3) enjoin any acts or other things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the bondholders;  (4) by notice in writing to the Authority declare all bonds due and payable and if all defaults shall be made good, to annul such declaration and its consequences;  (5) by action or suit in equity require the Authority to account as if it were trustee of an expressed trust for the stockholders.  Such trustee shall be entitled as a right to the appointment of a receiver who may to the extent that the Authority could itself do, enter and take possession of the facilities of the Authority or any part thereof, the revenue or receipts from which are or may be applicable to the payment of the bonds so in default, and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all revenue thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the Authority might do, and shall deposit all such monies in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court shall direct.  In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee, the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and the receiver, if any;  and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any revenues and receipts derived by the Authority, the revenues and receipts from which are or may be applicable to the payment of the bonds so in default.  Such trustee shall in addition to the foregoing have and possess all the powers necessary and appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the bondholders in the enforcement and protection of their rights.  In addition to other rights and limitations, any bondholder shall have the right by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding in law or in equity to enforce his rights against the Authority, including the right to require the Authority to carry out any agreement or covenant and to perform its duties under this subdivision.
