&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 234:43 Compact. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, shall appoint 3 persons resident in this state, as commissioners upon the part of the state of New Hampshire to enter into, with the state of Maine, by and through the commissioners who may be appointed under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Maine, an agreement or compact in the form following, that is to say:
<center>
<p>
<b>COMPACT</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the single highway bridge serving as the sole facility for vehicular traffic over and across the Piscataqua river between the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine is wholly inadequate to care for and accommodate such traffic over said river between the said 2 states and therefore causes such traffic congestion in and upon the streets and highways of the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the town of Kittery, Maine, that the lives and property of the citizens of said communities and the travelers on said streets and highways are constantly endangered;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the antiquated and obsolete wooden pile bridge serving as the sole facility for railroad traffic over and across the Piscataqua river between the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine is wholly inadequate to care for and accommodate the railroad traffic between the said 2 states;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the narrow draw-span of said wooden pile railroad bridge, the sole facility permitting passage of water traffic up and down said river, is wholly inadequate to permit the passage of steamers and vessels of broad beam from the sea inland to serve the large industrial plants now situate on the banks of said river and therefore constitutes an obstacle to further en largement of these industries and the development of numerous other industrial sites located so that passage through said bridge is absolutely necessary;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the only remedy for the conditions now existing is the construction of a bridge across said river which by coordinating the facilities required by vehicular and railroad traffic will remove the obstacle to water traffic;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
WHEREAS, the solution of this problem will result in great economy and benefit not only to the states of Maine and New Hampshire but to the nation and will require the cordial cooperation of the states of New Hampshire and Maine in the encouragement of the investment of capital as well as the formulation and execution of the necessary plans and such result can best be accomplished through the joining of the 2 states of Maine and New Hampshire by and through a common agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Now therefore, the said states of New Hampshire and Maine do hereby agree and pledge each to the other as follows:
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE I</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
