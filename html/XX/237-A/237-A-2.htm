&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 237-A:2 Issuance of Revenue Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The state may issue bonds under this chapter to be known as "turnpike system revenue bonds.''  The bonds may be issued from time to time for the purpose of financing the project costs of construction of any turnpike or of paying or refunding any bonds issued pursuant to RSA 237 or interest thereon.  Any such bonds issued to pay or refund bonds issued pursuant to RSA 237 or interest thereon may be issued in sufficient amount to cover items described in RSA 237-A:7.  Bonds issued hereunder shall be special obligations of the state and the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all bonds shall be payable solely from the particular funds provided therefor under this chapter.  The bonds shall be issued by the treasurer in such amounts as the governor and council shall determine, not exceeding in the aggregate $766,050,000.  Bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker's loan rate or other method as may be determined by the treasurer, and shall mature at such time or times as may be determined by the treasurer, except that no bond shall mature more than 40 years from the date of its issue.  Bonds may be made redeemable before maturity either at the option of the state or at the option of the holder, or on the occurrence of specified events, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the treasurer prior to the issue of bonds.  The treasurer shall determine the form and details of bonds.  Subject to RSA 93-A, the bonds shall be signed by the treasurer and countersigned by the governor.  The bonds may be sold in such manner, either at public or private sale, for such price, at such rate or rates of interest, or at such discount in lieu of interest, as the treasurer may determine.
