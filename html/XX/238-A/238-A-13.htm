&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All property owned or leased by the authority under this chapter is exempt from levy and sale by virtue of any execution.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority and its authorized officers, agents, and employees may enter upon any lands, waters, and premises in the state for the purpose of making surveys, soundings, drillings, and examinations it determines necessary under this chapter.  Such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.  The authority shall not be liable for the discovery during any such entry of any form of waste or environmental contamination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any county, municipality, or other political subdivision, any public agency or commission of the state, and any public service corporation or district, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of law, may lease, lend, grant, or convey to the authority, upon its request and upon such terms and conditions as the proper authorities of the political subdivision, agency, commission, public corporation, or district determine reasonable and fair, any real or personal property or rights in the property that are necessary or convenient to the effectuation of the authorized purposes of the authority, including real and personal property or rights in the property already devoted to public use.
