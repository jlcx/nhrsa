&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 230:74 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
As used in this subdivision:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Bicycle'' means every vehicle propelled solely by human power upon which any person may ride, having 2 tandem wheels, except scooters and similar devices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Bicycle route'' means any lane, way, path or trail designated by appropriate signs, that explicitly provides for bicycle travel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Bicycle lane'' means a portion of a roadway which has been designated for the preferential or exclusive use of bicycles.  It is distinguished from the portion of the roadway for motor vehicular traffic by a paint stripe or similar device.  Improved road edges are considered a bicycle lane where so designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Bicycle path or trail'' means a separate trail or path which is for the exclusive use of bicycles where a trail or path forms a part of a highway, which is separated from the roadway for motor vehicular traffic by an open space or barrier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 230:78 Duty of the Department of Transportation After Notice of Insufficiency. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever any class I or class II highway or highway bridge in the state shall be insufficient, any person may give notice of such insufficiency to the department of transportation.  The notice shall set forth in general terms the location of such highway or highway bridge, and the nature of such insufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of this subdivision, a highway or bridge thereon shall be considered "insufficient'' only if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It is not passable in any safe manner by those persons or vehicles permitted on such highway or bridge thereon;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) There exists a safety hazard which is not reasonably discoverable or reasonably avoidable by a person who is traveling upon such highway or highway bridge at posted speeds in obedience to all posted regulations, and in a manner which is reasonable and prudent as determined by the condition and state of repair of the highway or highway bridge, including any warning signs, and prevailing visibility and weather conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A highway or highway bridge shall not, in the absence of impassability or hidden hazard as set forth in paragraph II, be considered "insufficient'' merely by reason of the department of transportation's failure to construct, maintain or repair it to the same standard as some other highway or highway bridges or to a level of service commensurate with its current level of public use.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of transportation shall not be held liable for damages in an action to recover for personal injury or property damage arising out of its construction, maintenance, or repair of public highways and highway bridges unless such injury or damage was caused by an insufficiency, as defined by RSA 230:78, and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The department of transportation received a notice of such insufficiency as set forth in RSA 230:78, but failed to act as provided by RSA 230:79;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner of the department of transportation who is responsible for maintenance and repair of highways or highway bridges, had actual notice or knowledge of such insufficiency, by means other than notice pursuant to RSA 230:78 and was grossly negligent or exercised bad faith in responding or failing to respond to such actual knowledge;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The condition constituting the insufficiency was created by an intentional act of an employee acting in the scope of his official duty while in the course of his employment, acting with gross negligence, or with reckless disregard of the hazard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The department of transportation shall adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, relative to procedures for written and oral notice, and for the transfer of personal knowledge regarding insufficiencies to responsible supervisory persons, to insure that information relative to such insufficiencies in the highway system is quickly communicated to those empowered to make decisions about repairs and posting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any action to recover damages for bodily injury, personal injury or property damage arising out of construction, repair or maintenance of its public highways or highway bridges shall be dismissed unless the complaint describes with particularity the means by which the department of transportation received actual notice of the alleged insufficiency, or the intentional act which created the alleged insufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The acceptance or layout of a public highway shall not be construed to confer upon the department of transportation any notice of, or liability for, insufficiencies or defects which arose or were created prior to such layout or acceptance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The setting of construction, repair, or maintenance standards of levels of service of highways and highway bridges by the commissioner, whether accomplished formally or informally, shall be deemed a discretionary, policy function for which the department of transportation shall not be held liable in the absence of malice or bad faith.  However, the department shall develop and implement standards for the design and placement of rumble strips, drain grates, and road surface treatments that eliminate foreseen hazards for bicyclists by following federal guidelines.
