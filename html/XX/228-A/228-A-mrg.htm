&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 228-A:2 Issuance of Revenue Bonds.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The state may issue bonds under this chapter to be known as "federal highway grant anticipation bonds.''  The bonds may be issued from time to time for the purpose of financing project costs related to the widening of Interstate 93 from Manchester to the Massachusetts border, the replacement of the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and any other federally aided highway project hereafter authorized by the general court to be financed under this chapter.  Bonds issued hereunder shall be special obligations of the state and the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all bonds shall be payable solely from the particular funds provided therefor under this chapter.  The issuing of bonds shall be contingent upon the availability of sufficient anticipated federal aid over the term of the bonds.  The bonds shall be issued by the treasurer in such amounts as the fiscal committee of the general court and the governor and council shall determine, and shall not exceed $490,000,000.  Debt service for federal highway grant anticipation bonds (Garvee bonds) for the projects shall be paid from a portion of future federal funds.  Bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker's loan rate, or other method as may be determined by the treasurer, and shall mature at such time or times as may be determined by the treasurer, except that no bond shall mature more than 15 years from the date of its issue.  Bonds may be made redeemable before maturity either at the option of the state or at the option of the holder, or on the occurrence of specified events, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the treasurer prior to the issue of bonds.  The treasurer shall determine the form and details of bonds.  Subject to RSA 93-A, the bonds shall be signed by the treasurer and countersigned by the governor.  The bonds may be sold in such manner, either at public or private sale, for such price, including above or below par value, at such rate or rates of interest, or at such discount in lieu of interest, as the treasurer may determine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 228-A:3 Trust or Security Agreement or Resolution. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a resolution or by a trust or security agreement between the state and a corporate trustee or by a trust or security agreement directly between the state and the purchasers of the bonds.  Any corporate trustee that is a party to such resolution or trust or security agreement may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state.  Any such resolution or trust or security agreement shall be in such form and executed in such manner as may be determined by the treasurer, with the approval of the governor and council.  Such trust or security agreement or resolution may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues, as defined in RSA 228-A:1, held or to be received by the state and any contract or other rights to receive the same, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the state, and any proceeds thereof.  Such trust or security agreement or resolution may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may, in the discretion of the treasurer, be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such agreement or resolution may include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event thereof, which may include the acceleration of maturities, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The custody, safeguarding, investment and application of moneys;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The issue of additional or refunding bonds;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The use of any surplus bond proceeds;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The establishment of reserves;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The construction and operation of any highway or project related thereto;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Any contracts relating thereto;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Subsequent amendments of such provisions and contracts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company to act as a depository or trustee of the proceeds of bonds, revenues, or other moneys under a trust or security agreement or resolution.  It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company to furnish such indemnification or to pledge such securities and issue such letters or lines of credit or other credit facilities as may be required by the state acting under this chapter.  Any such trust or security agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.
