&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 228-A:2 Issuance of Revenue Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The state may issue bonds under this chapter to be known as "federal highway grant anticipation bonds.''  The bonds may be issued from time to time for the purpose of financing project costs related to the widening of Interstate 93 from Manchester to the Massachusetts border, the replacement or repair of the Memorial Bridge and the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and any other federally aided highway project hereafter authorized by the general court to be financed under this chapter.  Bonds issued hereunder shall be special obligations of the state and the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all bonds shall be payable solely from the particular funds provided therefor under this chapter.  The issuing of bonds shall be contingent upon the availability of sufficient anticipated federal aid over the term of the bonds.  The bonds shall be issued by the treasurer in such amounts as the fiscal committee of the general court and the governor and council shall determine, not exceeding $445,000,000 for federally aided highway projects and $45,000,000 for the replacement or repair of the Memorial Bridge and the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge.  Debt service for federal highway grant anticipation bonds (Garvee bonds) for the bridges shall be paid from a portion of future federal bridge funds.  Bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker's loan rate, or other method as may be determined by the treasurer, and shall mature at such time or times as may be determined by the treasurer, except that no bond shall mature more than 15 years from the date of its issue.  Bonds may be made redeemable before maturity either at the option of the state or at the option of the holder, or on the occurrence of specified events, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the treasurer prior to the issue of bonds.  The treasurer shall determine the form and details of bonds.  Subject to RSA 93-A, the bonds shall be signed by the treasurer and countersigned by the governor.  The bonds may be sold in such manner, either at public or private sale, for such price, including above or below par value, at such rate or rates of interest, or at such discount in lieu of interest, as the treasurer may determine.
