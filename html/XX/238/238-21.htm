<codesect>
The council shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Encourage towns and municipalities to designate scenic and cultural byways within their jurisdictions and to petition the council for the inclusion of these byways into the New Hampshire scenic and cultural byways system.  Such inclusion shall enable the municipality to participate in federal funding that may be available under section 1047, Scenic Byways Program, of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.  The council may also propose a statewide network of connecting highways.  Proposed connecting highways shall not be designated as scenic and cultural byways as defined and controlled under section 1047, Scenic Byways Program, of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Develop the process for byways nomination and nomination criteria.  Advise and consult with municipalities regarding the process of recommending municipal roads for inclusion in the scenic and cultural byways system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Encourage and assist in fostering public awareness, understanding, and participation in the objectives and functions of the scenic and cultural byways system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Provide municipalities with tools and ideas for enhancement and protection of the scenic and cultural byways.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Review the byway system and report biennially to the governor and the general court upon the effectiveness of this subdivision and make recommendations.  The reports shall indicate the status of all state and town designations and include a fiscal accounting of all moneys received and expended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. De-designate a scenic and cultural byway at the request of the municipality or if its character changes in such a way that it no longer meets the criteria under which it was designated.
