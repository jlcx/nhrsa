I. Apportionment A.  In each fiscal year, the commissioner shall allocate an amount not less than 12% of the total road toll revenue and motor vehicle fees collected in the preceding fiscal year to a local highway aid fund.  This fund shall be distributed to each city, town, and unincorporated place on a formula in which  1/2 of the amount is based on the proportion which the mileage of regularly maintained class IV and class V highways in each municipality, as of January 1 of the previous year, bears to the total of such mileage in the state;  and  1/2 of the amount is based on the proportion which the office of energy and planning population estimate of each municipality bears to the latest estimate of the total population of the state as of July 1 of the year of the estimate.  The aid to be distributed under this paragraph shall be in addition to all other state and federal aid specifically authorized by statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Apportionment B.  The commissioner shall allot to each municipality a sum sufficient, when added to the amount which would be derived by a tax of $.11 on each $100 of the municipality's last equalized valuation, to equal $117 for each mile of regularly maintained class V highway in such municipality, except that for any year in which the total allocated to the municipalities under this formula shall be less than $400,000, the commissioner shall use such other figure in place of $117 for each mile of regularly maintained class V highway as may be necessary to make the total allotment not less than $400,000.

I. There is established a highway and bridge betterment program for the purpose of highway construction, reconstruction, and resurfacing, and for bridge construction, bridge reconstruction and bridge maintenance, in each highway district in the state and for the purpose of insuring adequate maintenance and improvement of that portion of the state highway system not supported with federal aid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The program shall be funded from $.03 per gallon of the road toll imposed under RSA 260:32;  of these revenues, in each fiscal year 88 percent shall be deposited into a separate account established in the highway fund called the highway and bridge betterment account, to be allocated as provided in paragraph III.  The amount deposited into the highway and bridge betterment account is hereby continually appropriated and shall be nonlapsing.  The remaining 12 percent shall be distributed in accordance with the formula in RSA 235:23, I, and shall be in addition to any amounts to be allocated under that paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall allocate the funds in the highway and bridge betterment account for the 6 state highway districts in the following priority:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For each state highway district in the state, based upon a formula in which  1/2 of the amount of the funds distributed is based upon the proportion which the mileage of state-maintained class I, class II, and class III highways, excluding turnpikes, in each district, as of January 1 of the previous year, bears to the total of such mileage in the state;  and  1/2 of the amount of the funds distributed is based upon the proportion which the number of state maintained class I, class II and class III highway bridges, excluding turnpikes, in each district as of January 1 of the previous year bears to the total of such number of bridges in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner shall prepare a report not later than December 1 of each year which details the way in which the transportation department has expended funds for highway construction, reconstruction, and resurfacing, and for bridge construction, bridge reconstruction and bridge maintenance according to the provisions of paragraph III.  The report shall also clearly evaluate how well the betterment program is achieving its purpose using quantitative measures wherever practical.  The report shall be submitted no later than December 1 of each year to the president of the senate, the speaker of the house, the governor, the senate clerk, the house clerk, the state library, the chairperson of the house public works and highways committee, and the chairperson of the senate capital budget committee.

Any city, town or unincorporated place which suffers damage to its highways through disaster which is estimated to exceed  1/8 of one percent of its assessed valuation shall be entitled to aid in the repair of such damage.  The commissioner shall be notified of such damage and, after an investigation, shall estimate the amount of aid to which the city, town or unincorporated place is entitled.  The commissioner shall survey the damaged highways and prepare an estimate of cost for rehabilitation of these highways, notifying the towns of the proportionate share which the state will contribute and the estimated amount of aid available.  Aid to any city, town or unincorporated place shall be computed on that amount which is in excess of an amount equal to  1/8 of one percent of its assessed valuation and shall not exceed 75% of the cost of the damage in excess of this amount.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city, town or unincorporated place from making such emergency repairs as are deemed necessary for public convenience;  and such sum expended shall be considered part of the town's contribution.
