Fourteen days previous to the time any interest or principal is payable, on any general obligation bonds issued to finance the system, the state treasurer shall examine the existing balance and, except as otherwise provided in RSA 237:10, if such balance is insufficient to make the payment, then he shall notify the governor who shall immediately draw his warrant on the highway fund to cover any deficit and if the funds in both of the above accounts are insufficient, the governor shall draw his warrant upon the state's general fund to the amount necessary to meet the payments.  Any funds paid out from the state's highway fund or general fund for the above purposes shall be reimbursed from the collection of tolls as soon as such funds are available.  Any funds that have been or may be expended for any portion of the system by the department of transportation shall be repaid to said department when, in the opinion of the governor and council, sufficient funds are available.  Any excess income may be used for further system extensions in accordance with RSA 237:5, II(m).  No provision of this chapter shall constitute a covenant with bondholders with respect to the charging, collection or disposition of tolls.

I. Until the eastern New Hampshire turnpike becomes part of the New Hampshire turnpike system, tolls shall be established and revised from time to time under RSA 237:24 which are at least sufficient to meet the operating expenses and maintenance costs of the eastern New Hampshire turnpike and to pay the principal and interest on bonds issued to finance the eastern New Hampshire turnpike.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of transportation, acting by and on behalf of the state, is hereby authorized to convey to the bureau of turnpikes, and the bureau of turnpikes is authorized to acquire from the state, a portion of Interstate Route 95 in the city of Portsmouth for the sum of $120,000,000 and on such other terms and provisions as the commissioner of transportation and the bureau of turnpikes determine are reasonable or necessary to complete the acquisition.  The bureau of turnpikes is authorized to acquire, expand, and make improvements to the eastern New Hampshire turnpike from the northerly expansion joint of the Interstate Route 95 bridge over the Spaulding turnpike, U.S. Route 4, and N.H. Route 16 (bridge No. 197/122) north to a point on the New Hampshire-Maine boundary in the city of Portsmouth, such improvements to include the installation of open road tolling for the toll on Interstate Route 95 in Hampton.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The bureau of turnpikes shall operate and maintain this section of highway, which shall become part of the eastern New Hampshire turnpike under RSA 237:17 and the Blue Star memorial highway under RSA 237:18.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Acquisition and expansion of the eastern New Hampshire turnpike system for $120,000,000 plus interest shall be at the state borrowing rate to be paid over a maximum 20-year term to the highway fund from the New Hampshire turnpike system reserve account as follows:  $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2010, $20,000,000 in fiscal year 2011, and the balance to be paid under terms and conditions to be determined by the commissioner of transportation and the state treasurer.
