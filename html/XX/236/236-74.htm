<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) No lighting may be permitted to be used in any way in connection with any sign unless it is so effectively shielded as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed at any portion of the main traveled way of the interstate, federal aid primary or turnpike highways, or is of such low intensity or brilliance as not to cause glare or not to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle, or does not otherwise interfere with any driver's operation of a motor vehicle.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An advertising device shall not be maintained unless the name of the permittee appears legibly thereon.  Whether a name appears legibly shall be determined by the commissioner of transportation in accordance with such standards as he may from time to time prescribe.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Size.  With respect to advertising devices located in federal highway or turnpike adjacent areas or in view of any interstate, federal aid primary or turnpike highway:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Advertising devices may be erected with, but only with, an area not exceeding 750 square feet and with a maximum height of 20 feet and a maximum length of 50 feet, excluding border and trim, base or apron, supports and other structural members;  provided that the commissioner shall permit the maintenance of devices of larger size if lawfully erected prior to January 1, 1970 and otherwise permitted by the provisions of this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The maximum size limitations shall apply to each facing.  Two advertising devices not exceeding 350 square feet each may be erected in a facing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Farm signs maintained under RSA 236:73, V-a may be erected with an area not exceeding 48 square feet and with a maximum height of 8 feet and maximum length of 12 feet, excluding border and trim, base or apron, supports, and other structural members;  provided that the maximum size limitation shall apply to each facing.  Two farm signs not exceeding 24 square feet each may be erected in a facing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Lighting.  Advertising devices located in federal highway or turnpike adjacent areas may be lighted, subject only to such restriction with respect to devices to be erected as may from time to time be prescribed by the commissioner.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Advertising devices shall not be erected or maintained in such a manner as to obscure or otherwise physically interfere with an official traffic sign, signal or device or to obstruct or physically interfere with the driver's view of approaching, merging, or intersecting traffic, as determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Required spacing for advertising devices to be erected or maintained on one side of an interstate, turnpike or limited access federal aid primary highway shall be not less than 500 feet provided, however, that such spacing shall not apply to devices which are separated by a building or other obstruction in such manner that only one such device is visible from such highway at any one time.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Required spacing for advertising devices to be erected or maintained on one side of a nonlimited access federal aid primary highway in municipalities of 4,000 population or more shall be:

Advertising devices permitted under RSA 236:73, III, IV, and V shall not be considered advertising devices for purposes of any measurement or determination made under this paragraph, or for purposes of any other requirements of this paragraph.  Advertising devices permitted under RSA 236:73, V-a shall not be considered advertising devices for purposes of any measurement or determination made under subparagraph (b), (d), or (e), but for such advertising devices to be erected or maintained on both sides of a federal aid primary highway, the required spacing shall be 1,000 feet.
