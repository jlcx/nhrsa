&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be unlawful to construct, or alter in any way that substantially affects the size or grade of, any driveway, entrance, exit, or approach within the limits of the right-of-way of any class I or class III highway or the state-maintained portion of a class II highway that does not conform to the terms and specifications of a written permit issued by the commissioner of transportation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Pursuant to this section, a written construction permit application must be obtained from and filed with the department of transportation by any abutter affected by the provisions of paragraph I.  Before any construction or alteration work is commenced, said permit application shall have been reviewed, and a construction permit issued by said department.  Said permit shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Describe the location of the driveway, entrance, exit, or approach.  The location shall be selected to most adequately protect the safety of the traveling public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Describe any drainage structures, traffic control devices, and channelization islands to be installed by the abutter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Establish grades that adequately protect and promote highway drainage and permit a safe and controlled approach to the highway in all seasons of the year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Include any other terms and specifications necessary for the safety of the traveling public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For access to a proposed commercial or industrial enterprise, or to a subdivision, all of which for the purposes of this section shall be considered a single parcel of land, even though acquired by more than one conveyance or held nominally by more than one owner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Said permit application shall be accompanied by engineering drawings showing information as set forth in paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless all season safe sight distance of 400 feet in both directions along the highway can be obtained, the commissioner shall not permit more than one access to a single parcel of land, and this access shall be at that location which the commissioner determines to be safest.  The commissioner shall not give final approval for use of any additional access until it has been proven to him that the 400-foot all season safe sight distance has been provided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For the purposes of this section, all season safe sight distance is defined as a line which encounters no visual obstruction between 2 points, each at a height of 3 feet 9 inches above the pavement, and so located as to represent the critical line of sight between the operator of a vehicle using the access and the operator of a vehicle approaching from either direction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No construction permit shall allow:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A driveway, entrance, exit, or approach to be constructed more than 50 feet in width, except that a driveway, entrance, exit, or approach may be flared beyond a width of 50 feet at its junction with the highway to accommodate the turning radius of vehicles expected to use the particular driveway, entrance, exit or approach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) More than 2 driveways, entrances, exits or approaches from any one highway to any one parcel of land unless the frontage along that highway exceeds 500 feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The same powers concerning highways under their jurisdiction as are conferred upon the commissioner of transportation by paragraphs I, II, III and IV shall be conferred upon the planning board in cities and towns in which the planning board has been granted the power to regulate the subdivision of land as provided in RSA 674:35, and they shall adopt such regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.  Such regulations may delegate administrative duties, including actual issuance of permits, to a highway agent, board of selectmen, or other qualified official or body.  Such regulations, or any permit issued under them, may contain provisions governing the breach, removal, and reconstruction of stone walls or fences within, or at the boundary of, the public right of way, and any landowner or landowner's agent altering a boundary in accordance with such provisions shall be deemed to be acting under a mutual agreement with the city or town pursuant to RSA 472:6, II(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner of transportation or planning board shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the adequacy and safety of every existing driveway, entrance, exit, and approach to a highway, whether or not such access was constructed or installed pursuant to a permit under this section, and, unless the access is a public highway, the owners of property to which the access is appurtenant shall have continuing responsibility for the adequacy of the access and any grades, culverts, or other structures pertaining to such access, whether or not located within the public right of way.  If any such access is or becomes a potential threat to the integrity of the highway or its surface, ditches, embankments, bridges, or other structures, or a hazard to the safety of the traveling public, by reason of siltation, flooding, erosion, frost action, vegetative growth, improper grade, or the failure of any culvert, traffic control device, drainage structure, or any other feature, the commissioner of transportation or planning board or their designee may issue an order to the landowner or other party responsible for such access to repair or remove such hazardous condition and to obtain any and all permits required therefor.  The order shall describe the hazard, prescribe what corrective action or alteration in the location or configuration of such access shall be required, and set a reasonable time within which the action shall be completed.  Such an order shall be sent by certified mail, and shall be enforceable to the same extent as a permit issued under this section.  If the order is not complied with within the time prescribed, the commissioner or planning board or their designee may cause to be taken whatever action is necessary to protect the highway and the traveling public, and the owner or other responsible party shall be civilly liable to the state or municipality for its costs in taking such action.

(d) "Electronic toll collection monitoring system'' means a system whereby a vehicle sensor is placed in a location to work in conjunction with an electronic toll collection system to produce at least one photograph, microphotograph, videotape, recorded image, or written record of a portion of the vehicle when the vehicle is used or operated in violation of the electronic toll collection system rules. "Electronic toll collection monitoring system'' shall also include any other technology that identifies a vehicle by a photographic, electronic, or other method.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) "Violation'' means to fail, neglect, or refuse to pay the toll or charge for the use of a bridge, highway, or part thereof, by a motor vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No person shall fail, neglect, or refuse to pay the toll or charge for the use of any bridge, highway, or part thereof;  or use, or attempt to use, any device or method which results in an electronic toll collection monitoring system being unable to accurately assess or collect the toll or charge due or to detect the non-payment of the toll or charge.  Any person violating this section shall be subject to the provisions of this section and to an order of suspension pursuant to RSA 263:56-f.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The owner of a vehicle using a bridge or highway subject to a toll or charge shall be responsible for payment of the toll and charges due, plus any administrative fees the department assesses in accordance with its rules, and to an order of suspension under RSA 263:56-f, unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The vehicle was taken without owner's consent, pursuant to RSA 262:12, or was a stolen vehicle at the time of the violation and the owner provides to the department, or its designee, upon receipt of notice of a violation of this section, a copy of a report of the unauthorized taking or theft made to a law enforcement agency;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The vehicle was leased or rented to another person, and the owner submits to the department, or its designee, a copy of the rental agreement, lease, or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date of the violation with the name and address of the renter or lessee clearly legible;  at which time the renter or lessee of the vehicle on the date of the violation shall be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of this section, and shall be subject to the notice and order of suspension under RSA 263:56-f.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding RSA 237:16-d, the department shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A for the implementation of a system to detect, record, verify, and administratively enforce violations of this section.  The rules shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The criteria used to establish that a toll or charge has not been paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A procedure to promptly resolve inadvertent violations in the accounts of electronic toll system customers otherwise in good standing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A procedure for processing all other violations of this section, which shall require the department, or its designee, to send by regular mail, or other agreed upon method, an advisory and payment request to the owner of the vehicle, within 30 days of the date of the violation.  The advisory and payment request shall notify the owner of the date, time, and location of the alleged violation, give the owner the opportunity to resolve the alleged violation by payment of the toll or charge due and a reasonable administrative fee, and advise the owner that failure to pay the required toll or charge and administrative fee within 60 days of the date of the violation shall cause the department to file a report with the department of safety, division of motor vehicles, seeking an order of suspension pursuant to RSA 263:56-f.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A schedule of administrative fees to be imposed upon those who violate this section.  Such administrative fees shall be set from time to time in an amount sufficient to permit the department to fully recover its costs, and the costs incurred by the department of safety, to administer, maintain, and upgrade the violation enforcement system.  All funds received under this section shall be deposited in the turnpike fund.  The department of transportation may, with the approval of the fiscal committee of the general court and the governor and council, draw from the turnpike fund to administer the electronic toll system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any electronic toll collection monitoring equipment acquired, operated by, or used by the department, or its designee, shall be designed to make a record of the front, or rear, or both, portions of the vehicle, including any registration plates affixed to the vehicle.  Such equipment shall not be designed to produce a photograph, microphotograph, videotape, or other recorded image of the face of the operator or any passenger in the motor vehicle, unless the production of such image is unavoidable because the operator or passenger is not in a passenger compartment, as on a motorcycle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) The department, and any designee of the department, shall maintain the confidentiality of all information acquired in connection with the administration and enforcement of toll evasion, including but not limited to credit and account data, photographs or other images, and all personally identifying information obtained relative to owners of vehicles.  Such information shall not be a public record subject to disclosure under RSA 91-A and shall be used solely for enforcement of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The department, or any agent that has contracted with the department to gather, collect, maintain, store, or collate any information acquired in connection with the administration and enforcement of toll collection, shall not use, share, reveal, duplicate, sell, provide access to, or by any other means use, or allow other entities to use, such information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The transponders and the monitoring system used in electronic toll collection shall not be used to track or determine the location of a vehicle or be used to collect information, including but not limited to the name, street address, post office box number, license, or billing information, about the individual and vehicle associated with the transponder, except at each point where a toll is collected or incurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Nothing in this section shall prevent access to the data collected in the administration and enforcement of toll collection by a certified law enforcement officer conducting an investigation undertaken pursuant to a court order, or in exigent circumstances.

Distances from advertising devices which are erected or maintained or are able to be erected, or distances to such devices, shall be measured along the edge (nearest to any such devices or any locations in which such devices are able to be erected) of the main traveled way of an interstate, federal aid primary or turnpike highway from or to points on such edge directly opposite such devices or locations.  Advertising devices permitted under RSA 236:73, III, IV, and V shall not be considered advertising devices for purposes of any measurement or determination made under this paragraph, or for purposes of any other requirements of this paragraph.  Advertising devices permitted under RSA 236:73, V-a shall not be considered advertising devices for purposes of any measurement or determination made under subparagraph (b), (d), or (e), but for such advertising devices to be erected or maintained on both sides of a federal aid primary highway, the required spacing shall be 1,000 feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Farm signs to be erected or maintained under RSA 236:73, V-a shall be located not farther than 10 miles from the property where the advertised activities are located.

A permit under this subdivision may be denied or revoked, or a renewal denied only:  (a) pursuant to RSA 236:77 or (b) for failure to obtain or have a license, or (c) for false or misleading information given in the application for such permit or renewal, or (d) for the erection or maintenance of the advertising device permitted or to be permitted in violation of the provisions of this subdivision or rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner of transportation.  The department shall notify an applicant, licensee, or permittee of a denial, nonrenewal, or revocation 30 days prior to taking final action.  The applicant, licensee, or permittee may, within that 30 days, correct such information or violation, in which case the application, license, or permit shall be renewed or shall not be denied or revoked.  The applicant, licensee, or permittee may also appeal the decision or action to the commissioner or designee within the 30-day period after such notice.  Denial, revocation, and nonrenewal shall become final 30 days after such notice unless an appeal is filed.  Hearings on denials, revocations, or nonrenewals shall be held in accordance with RSA 541-A.  If a revocation of a license or permit or a determination that there should be a denial of a license or permit, or renewal thereof, is made after such a hearing the licensee or permittee, or applicant for such license or permit, or renewal thereof, shall have a right to a rehearing and a right of appeal as provided in RSA 541.

If the commissioner cannot reasonably ascertain the name and address of the owner of the device, notice may be given by 3 publications of notice in a newspaper in the county where the device is located once in each week for 3 successive weeks, the last publication to be at least 30 days prior to such hearing.  The owner of the device may within such 30 days correct any violation of the provisions of this subdivision or the rules and regulations of the commissioner adopted pursuant hereto, and in such case the device shall not be required to be removed and no hearing will be held.  Application for a license or permit within such 30 days shall be deemed a correction of any failure to obtain such a license or permit.

IV. Such compensation shall be paid to the person or persons entitled thereto upon presentation to the commissioner of such information as he may reasonably require, provided that the claim for compensation is filed within 90 days after removal is completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the commissioner and a claimant do not reach agreement on the amount of compensation payable to such claimant in respect to any removal within 120 days after the filing of such claim, the claimant may institute an action to have such compensation determined as an assessment of damages suffered by the claimant as of the date of the removal.  Such an action shall be instituted by filing a petition for assessment of damages in the superior court, in the county wherein the advertising device and land are located, or wherein the claimant resides or has its principal place of business in this state.  The petition shall be filed no later than one year after the filing with the commissioner of such compensation claim.  The court shall assess the damages by jury, or by the court without the jury, and award interest from the date as of which damages are assessed, and costs, to the claimant.
