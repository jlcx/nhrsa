&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 236:97 Grant or Denial of Application;  Appeal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
After the hearing the commissioner of transportation shall, within 2 weeks, make a finding as to whether or not the application should be granted, giving notice of his finding to the applicant by mail, postage prepaid, to the address given on the application.  If approved by the commissioner of transportation, the license including the certificate of approved location shall be forthwith issued to remain in effect until the following April 1.  License approval is personal to the applicant for a specific location and it is not assignable or transferable.  Licenses shall be renewed annually thereafter on April 1, upon payment of the annual license fee without a hearing if all provisions of this subdivision are complied with during the license period, and if the applicant is not convicted of any type of larceny or of receiving stolen goods.  A writ of certiorari lies from the denial of the application to the superior court of the county in which the proposed location is situated.
