<codesect>
Notwithstanding any provisions of the law to the contrary, it shall be unlawful to affix, attach or display any advertisement upon any object of nature, utility pole, telephone booth, or highway sign, directly in such a manner that the object of nature, utility pole, telephone booth, or highway sign, is utilized as an integral part of the sign's support as distinguished from being only incidentally a support to the sign, such as the earth or ground upon which a sign is affixed.  This prohibition shall extend to all primary and secondary highways and roads of and within the state without exception for any type of advertising.  The owner of an object upon which an advertisement is placed in violation of this section shall be entitled to remove and destroy the advertisement and the advertisement owner shall not be entitled to damages or compensation therefor.
