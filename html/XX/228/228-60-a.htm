&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All railroad rights of way and rail properties acquired by the commissioner or by the state are hereby declared to be owned in fee simple absolute.

Any person damaged thereby may make claim by petition against the commissioner to the appropriate superior court within 5 years of the date of acquisition or declaration of fee simple absolute ownership.  The petition shall then be referred to the board of tax and land appeals, which shall proceed as with a condemnation under RSA 498-A.

(d) A statement describing the physical condition on the line proposed to be abandoned or on which service is proposed to be discontinued.
<br>
