&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 228:4 State Transportation Projects. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each state transportation project shall be built under contracts awarded to the lowest responsible bidder through competitive bidding.  The following are excluded from this competitive bidding requirement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Normal highway and bridge maintenance and improvements.  This includes state aided town road and bridge projects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Projects executed under RSA 481 with approval of the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Statewide transportation improvement program projects with a cost not to exceed $25,000,000 may be developed and constructed utilizing the design build concept based on a request for proposal.  Such projects may be developed and constructed provided that selection is based on an objective standard and measurable criteria for evaluation of the proposals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Statewide transportation improvement program projects with a cost in excess of $25,000,000 may be developed and constructed utilizing the design build concept based on a request for proposal provided that the department first demonstrates that using the design build concept for the project in question benefits the state more than using conventional contracting methods.  The department shall hold a publicly noticed hearing to take comment on its proposal to use the design build concept for a particular project.  Such notice shall be provided at least 14 days prior to the hearing date.  The department shall allow for a 30-day public comment period following the publicly-noticed hearing before submitting its proposed use of the design build concept to the governor and executive council for formal approval.  After the governor and council approve use of the design build concept for the project, the department may solicit bids from contractors.  Any contract with the selected bidder shall be submitted to the governor and council for final approval.  The commissioner shall report the results of any statewide transportation improvement program project using the design build concept to the capital budget overview committee within 90 days after the completion of the project.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. State transportation projects shall not be awarded through cost-plus contracts.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the commissioner decides that the bid of the lowest bidder should be accepted, he or she shall prepare a contract of acceptance of the lowest bid within 60 days from the opening of bids.  He or she shall execute the contract in the name of the state.  After the contract is executed by the lowest bidder, the form of it approved by the attorney general, and the availability of funds approved by the commissioner of administrative services, he or she shall transmit the contract to the governor and council.  Upon approval by the governor and council, it shall become a valid contract of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state reserves the right to reject any and all bids or to negotiate with the lowest responsible bidder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the commissioner decides that for just cause shown the lowest bid submitted should be rejected, he or she shall promptly transmit to the governor and council the recommendation for rejection including reasons.  The governor and council shall review the recommendation and any other facts available to them, and make such determination as in their judgment shall be for the best interest of the state.  They shall require a public hearing upon request of any bidder or on their own motion to fully establish such facts.  Their determination shall be entered upon the records of the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If not more than one bid is received on any state project advertised for contract construction, the commissioner may negotiate a contract for such construction upon terms which he or she may deem most advantageous to the state, subject to the approval of the governor and council.  For projects built with federal aid, if any provision of this section is inconsistent with the requirements of applicable federal law and regulations, the latter shall control.

This purchase shall be a charge against the inventory fund and the prison shall be responsible for the control and accountability of the raw materials so charged.  Said number plates shall be manufactured at the state prison.  The prison shall be furnished out of said inventory account the raw materials necessary to manufacture said plates and upon receipt of the finished plates by the department of safety shall be reimbursed for their direct and indirect costs.  The commissioner of safety shall, biennially, request the commissioner of administrative services to review and approve said cost rates.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner of safety shall charge, in addition to the regular motor vehicle registration fee, a number plate manufacturing fee of $4.00 per plate at the time of issuing said reflectorized motor vehicle number plates or replacement reflectorized number plates.  Said additional charge shall not give the registrant any title or other property interest in said plates.  The commissioner of safety or assistant commissioner may request from time to time delivery of the number plates from the prison and shall reimburse the inventory fund by a transfer from revenue.  At least 6 months prior to subsequent general issue, a transfer from revenue shall be made for all remaining finished plates in inventory.  The commissioner of safety shall report to the governor, the president of the senate, and the speaker of the house of representatives, no later than 90 days after the close of the second fiscal year of each biennium, the year ending balance in the inventory fund and the department's recommendation as to when the next general issue of number plates should commence, the estimated cost of such a general issue, and the estimated annual cost to support routine plate issue and replacement without a new general issue.

I. Notwithstanding RSA 228:57, portions of real estate owned by the state and managed by the bureau of rail and transit in the department of transportation that are on the shores of public waters, as defined by RSA 271:20, may be leased for private, noncommercial use by owners of adjacent residentially developed properties that are either fully constructed or for which owners can demonstrate incurring substantial liabilities in a reasonable good faith reliance on the absence of controlling law or regulation, known as vested rights, prior to January 1, 2011, and that are separated from the shore only by the railroad land, as long as such use does not interfere with railroad operations.  The following shall constitute sufficient evidence of vested rights:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The activities are specifically identified in a building permit application that has been approved by the appropriate municipal board or official with authority over building permits prior to January 1, 2011;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At a minimum, a concrete foundation, or its equivalent, for the primary structure was installed prior to January 1, 2011.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Any property owner meeting the requirements of this section may request in writing to be allowed to lease such property from the state.  However, when the adjacent property is owned by more than one individual, such as a condominium association, the association, only as a single entity, may request the lease.  In no case shall more than one access point to the leased property be allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The provisions of RSA 4:40, requiring first offering the land for lease to political subdivisions, shall not apply to this section.  However, leases shall continue to be approved by the long range capital planning and utilization committee, with advice from the council on resources and development, before final approval by the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. A lease agreement under this section for the sole purpose of installing a dock or mooring shall only be made subject to the acquisition by the lessee of a dock permit from the department of environmental services or a mooring permit from the department of safety, respectively.  Such a lease agreement shall state that if the dock or mooring permit is denied or revoked, the lease shall be terminated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Leases shall be for a period of not more than 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For new leases or renewals of existing leases on and after January 1, 2010, the cost of the lease shall be $30 per running foot per year, paid annually;  provided, however, that the cost per running foot for such leases shall be adjusted by the department every 5 years according to the Consumer Price Index as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Leases may be renewed after the initial lease period has expired, provided that the use of the leased property has and will remain noncommercial and private, payments have been made by the lessee according to the lease, and the activity of the railroad remains at approximately the same level or lower.  The cost for the lease shall be reviewed.  Such lease renewals shall not be for more than 5 years at a time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The annual income from such leases shall be deposited into the special railroad fund established by RSA 228:68, and shall be appropriated to be expended as set forth in RSA 228:69.
