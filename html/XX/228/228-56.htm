&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 228:56 Acquisition and Necessity. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any provisions of the law to the contrary, the commissioner, as sole agent for the state, and with the approval of the governor and council, is authorized to acquire, by purchase or condemnation, or otherwise, such portion or portions of the rail property of any railroad corporation, including such tracks and ties, rights-of-way, land, buildings, appurtenances and other facilities necessary and required for the operation of railroads, as well as any other property found by the commissioner to be necessary for the operation of a railroad or other transportation purposes, including recreational trails.  The authority to acquire such rail properties shall extend to rail properties within, as well as those not within, the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and includes rail properties within the purview of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, and any amendments thereto or other pertinent federal legislation.  The acquisition of such rail properties and other property by the commissioner shall be for the purpose of the continued and future operation of a railroad or transportation corridor, including recreational trails, which is deemed to be in the public interest and which shall include the authority to sell or lease said properties.  The acquisition of such rail properties and other property is declared to be a public use and to be reasonably necessary.  This action may be taken in concert with another state or states as necessary to insure continued rail service and to insure continuous corridors, including recreational trails.
