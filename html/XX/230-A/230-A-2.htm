<codesect>
A layout authority may determine upon hearing whether there is occasion for the designation of one or more highway planning corridors.  For class I or II highways, the location shall be proposed by the commissioner of the department of transportation.  In making such determination the layout authority shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Identify public transportation needs for the present and foreseeable future.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Determine whether the public interest requires development restriction along proposed planning corridors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Allow flexibility in planning the design of the highway.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Consider methods to prevent disruption and relocation of residential neighborhoods, residences, and businesses and interference with utility facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Determine the acquisition costs of subsequently developed property if a highway planning corridor is not established.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Establish the termini and width of the proposed highway planning corridor.
