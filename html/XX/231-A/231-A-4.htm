&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231-A:4 Public Trail Use Restrictions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter "public trail use restrictions'' means any restrictions upon use of a trail by the general public.  Such restrictions may be imposed by a landowner as a condition of grant or dedication of a trail acquired under RSA 231-A:5, or by vote of the local legislative body or its designee at or subsequent to the time the trail is established, or by the local governing body under RSA 41:11.  Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to, prohibition of motor vehicles, prohibition of wheeled vehicles, prohibition of off highway recreational vehicles, or restriction to specified modes of travel such as horse, bicycle, or foot.  Such restrictions, if posted using legible signs at entrances to the trail from public highways, or at any property boundaries where new or different restrictions become applicable, shall be enforceable in the same manner as traffic violations as set forth in RSA 265.  Any person violating such restrictions shall be guilty of a violation.
