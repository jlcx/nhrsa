&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231-A:1 Class A and B Trails. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A class A trail shall be a full public right-of-way, of indefinite duration subject to public trail use restrictions.  It shall not have the status of a publicly approved street, and shall not be used as a vehicular access for any new building or structure, or for the expansion, enlargement, or increased intensity of use of any existing building or structure.  It may, however, be used by the owners of land abutting on such trail, or land served exclusively by such trail, to provide access for such nondevelopment uses as agriculture and forestry, or for access to any building or structure existing prior to its designation as a trail, and such owners' access for such uses shall be exempt from applicable public trail use restrictions, subject only to reasonable time, season and manner regulations imposed by the local governing body.  The municipality shall bear no responsibility for maintaining the trail for such uses by abutting owners.  Such owners shall, prior to excavation, construction or disturbance of a class A trail, obtain permission from the municipal officers, in the same manner prescribed for highways in RSA 236:9-11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A class B trail shall be a full public right-of-way of indefinite duration subject to public trail use restrictions.  It shall not have the status of a publicly approved street, shall not be used as a vehicular access for any new or existing building or structure, and shall not be used by the owners of land served by or abutting on such trail in any manner inconsistent with applicable public trail use restrictions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231-A:2 Reclassification of Highways;  Damages. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any class V or VI highway may be reclassified as a class A or class B trail, and any class A trail may be reclassified as a class B trail, by vote of the local legislative body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In accordance with RSA 231:43, no highway of any class which provides the sole access to any land shall be reclassified as a class B trail without the written consent of the owner of that land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever a reclassification is made under this section, any aggrieved landowner may appeal, or may petition for the assessment of damages, in the same manner as in the discontinuance of highways pursuant to RSA 231:48 and 231:49, and the amount of damages, if any, shall reflect the landowner use provisions set forth in RSA 231-A:1.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h3>Section 231-A:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 231-A:4 Public Trail Use Restrictions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter "public trail use restrictions'' means any restrictions upon use of a trail by the general public.  Such restrictions may be imposed by a landowner as a condition of grant or dedication of a trail acquired under RSA 231-A:5, or by vote of the local legislative body or its designee at or subsequent to the time the trail is established, or by the local governing body under RSA 41:11.  Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to, prohibition of motor vehicles, prohibition of wheeled vehicles, prohibition of off highway recreational vehicles, or restriction to specified modes of travel such as horse, bicycle, or foot.  Such restrictions, if posted using legible signs at entrances to the trail from public highways, or at any property boundaries where new or different restrictions become applicable, shall be enforceable in the same manner as traffic violations as set forth in RSA 265.  Any person violating such restrictions shall be guilty of a violation.

<br>
