<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Failure of the transferor to comply with RSA 463-A:9, III, concerning the possession and control;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463-A:12 Care of Custodial Property. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>

I. A custodian shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Take control of custodial property;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Register or record title to custodial property if appropriate;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries.  If a custodian has a special skill or expertise or is named custodian on the basis of representations of a special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise.  However, a custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor's estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The life of the minor only if the minor or the minor's estate is the sole beneficiary;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the extent that the minor, the minor's estate, or the custodian in the capacity of custodian, is the irrevocable beneficiary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor.  Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the minor's interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed.  Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration is so identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words:  "as a custodian for __________ (name of minor) under the New Hampshire Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial property, including information necessary for the preparation of the minor's tax returns, and shall make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent or legal representative of the minor or by the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years.

If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing, and eligible to serve was nominated under RSA 463-A:3, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under RSA 463-A:3, otherwise the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under RSA 463-A:9, I.  The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under RSA 463-A:4 as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor.  If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, or is removed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years and to the successor custodian and by delivering the custodial property to the successor custodian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a custodian is ineligible, dies, or becomes incapacitated without having effectively designated a successor and the minor has attained the age of 14 years, the minor may designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in paragraph II, an adult member of the minor's family, a conservator of the minor, or a trust company.  If the minor has not attained the age of 14 years or fails to act within 60 days after the ineligibility, death, or incapacity, the conservator of the minor becomes successor custodian.  If the minor has no conservator or the conservator declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor's family, or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A custodian who declines to serve under paragraph I, or resigns under paragraph III, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian.  The successor custodian by action may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor's family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the conservator of the minor, or the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years may petition the court to remove the custodian for cause and designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under RSA 463-A:4 or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463-A:20 Termination of Custodianship. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The custodian shall transfer in an appropriate manner the custodial property to the minor or to the minor's estate upon the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The minor's attainment of 21 years of age with respect to custodial property transferred under RSA 463-A:4 or 463-A:5;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The minor's attainment of 18 years of age with respect to custodial property transferred under RSA 463-A:6 or 463-A:7;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The minor's death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Paragraph I applies to all custodial property held under the provisions of this chapter, whether such custodial property was transferred to the custodian before, on, or after June 30, 1989.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At any time, a custodian may transfer part or all of the custodial property to a qualified minor's trust, as defined in RSA 463-A:1, XIII-a, without a court order.  Such a transfer terminates the custodianship to the extent of the transfer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463-A:21 Applicability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
This chapter applies to a transfer within the scope of RSA 463-A:2 made after July 30, 1985 if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The transfer purports to have been made under the New Hampshire Uniform Gifts to Minors Law;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The instrument by which the transfer purports to have been made uses in substance the designation "as custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act'' or "as custodian under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act'' of any other state, and the application of this chapter is necessary to validate the transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To the extent that this chapter, by virtue of RSA 463-A:23, II, does not apply to transfers made in a manner prescribed in the New Hampshire Uniform Gifts to Minors Law or to the powers, duties, and immunities conferred by transfers in that manner upon custodians and persons dealing with custodians, the repeal of the New Hampshire Uniform Gifts to Minors Law does not affect those transfers or those powers, duties, and immunities.
