&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Subject to paragraphs II and III, a person not subject to RSA 463-A:5 or 6 who holds property of or owes a liquidated debt to a minor not having a conservator may make an irrevocable transfer to a custodian for the benefit of the minor pursuant to RSA 463-A:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a person having the right to do so under RSA 463-A:3 has nominated a custodian under that section to receive the custodial property, the transfer must be made to that person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If no custodian has been nominated under RSA 463-A:3, or all persons so nominated as custodian die before the transfer or are unable, decline, or are ineligible to serve, a transfer under this section may be made to an adult member of the minor's family or to a trust company unless the property exceeds $10,000 in value.
