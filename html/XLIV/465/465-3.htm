&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 465:3 Limitation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful for any person to accept appointment as guardian of any ward if such proposed guardian shall at that time be acting as guardian for 5 wards.  In any case, upon presentation of a petition by an attorney of the Department of Veterans Affairs under this section alleging that a guardian is acting in a fiduciary capacity for more than 5 wards and requesting his discharge for that reason, the court, upon proof substantiating the petition, shall require a final accounting forthwith from such guardian and shall discharge such guardian in said case.  An individual may be guardian of more than 5 wards if they are all members of the same family.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to the director of the state office of veterans services acting under an appointment made pursuant to RSA 465:5.
