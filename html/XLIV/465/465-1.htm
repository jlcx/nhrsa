<center><h2>CHAPTER 465<br>GUARDIANSHIP OF INCOMPETENT VETERANS, ETC.</h2></center>
<center><h3>Section 465:1</h3></center>
<br><center>This chapter was modeled after the original 1928 version of The Uniform Veterans' Guardianship Act (1928) which was withdrawn from recommendation for enactment by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1942 due to it being superseded by the revised Uniform Veterans' Guardianship Act of 1942.  New Hampshire has not adopted the 1942 revision of The Uniform Veterans' Guardianship Act.</center>
