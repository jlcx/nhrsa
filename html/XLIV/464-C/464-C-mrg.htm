<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The respondent has a home state, a petition for an appointment or order is not pending in a court of that state or another significant-connection state, and, before the court makes the appointment or issues the order:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-C:13 Jurisdiction Declined by Reason of Conduct. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If at any time a court of this state determines that it acquired jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order because of unjustifiable conduct, the court may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Decline to exercise jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Exercise jurisdiction for the limited purpose of fashioning an appropriate remedy to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the respondent or the protection of the respondent's property or prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a petition for the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a protective order is filed in a court of another state having jurisdiction;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Continue to exercise jurisdiction after considering:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The extent to which the respondent and all persons required to be notified of the proceedings have acquiesced in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Whether it is a more appropriate forum than the court of any other state under the factors set forth in RSA 464-C:12, III;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Whether the court of any other state would have jurisdiction under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional standards of RSA 464-C:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a court of this state determines that it acquired jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order because a party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction engaged in unjustifiable conduct, it may assess against that party necessary and reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, investigative fees, court costs, communication expenses, witness fees and expenses, and travel expenses.  The court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses of any kind against this state or a governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of this state unless authorized by law other than this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-C:17 Accepting Guardianship or Conservatorship Transferred From Another State. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To confirm transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship transferred to this state under provisions similar to RSA 464-C:16, the guardian or conservator shall petition the court in this state to accept the guardianship or conservatorship.  The petition shall include a certified copy of the other state's provisional order of transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notice of a petition under paragraph I shall be given to those persons that would be entitled to notice if the petition were a petition for the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a protective order in both the transferring state and this state.  The notice shall be given in the same manner as notice is required to be given in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. On the court's own motion or on request of the guardian or conservator, the incapacitated or protected person, or other person required to be notified of the proceeding, the court shall hold a hearing on a petition filed pursuant to paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court shall issue an order provisionally granting a petition filed under paragraph I unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The guardian or conservator is ineligible for appointment in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court shall issue a final order accepting the proceeding and appointing the guardian or conservator as guardian or conservator in this state upon its receipt from the court from which the proceeding is being transferred of a final order issued under provisions similar to RSA 464-C:16 transferring the proceeding to this state.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In issuing a final order under RSA 464-C:17, V, the court shall recognize a guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state, including the determination of the incapacitated or protected person's incapacity and the appointment of the guardian or conservator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Not later than 90 days after issuance of a final order accepting transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship, the court shall determine whether the guardianship or conservatorship needs to be modified to conform to the law of this state and enter orders in accordance therewith.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The denial by a court of this state of a petition to accept a guardianship or conservatorship transferred from another state does not affect the ability of the guardian or conservator to seek appointment as guardian or conservator in this state under RSA 464-A if the court has jurisdiction to make an appointment other than by reason of the provisional order of transfer.
