I. Any person who has been appointed guardian of the estate or conservator for any ward by a court of competent jurisdiction in any other state shall, upon petition and filing of a certified copy of that appointment with the court, be appointed guardian of the estate or conservator of the ward in this state without further notice or hearing.  The court, as a condition of appointment, may require the guardian or conservator to post an adequate surety bond to insure the faithful performance of his or her duties.  Upon such appointment, the foreign guardian of the estate or conservator may deal with the estate of the ward situated in this state in the same manner as a resident guardian of the estate or conservator and in accordance with RSA 464-A:27.  The foreign guardian of the estate or conservator shall account to the court of his or her original appointment for the proceeds from the sale of any of the ward's estate situated in this state.  A certified copy of the approved account shall be filed with the court in this state prior to discharge of the guardian of the estate or conservator.  In lieu of a certified copy of an approved account, the guardian or conservator may file an affidavit stating that the assets of the ward situated in this state have been transferred to the estate of the ward in the foreign jurisdiction.  Upon receipt of the affidavit, the court in this state shall discharge the guardian of the estate or conservator.  No term of guardianship or conservatorship under this section shall exceed 30 months, unless for good cause shown and within the discretion of the court.
