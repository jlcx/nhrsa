I. When a married man and his wife are both under guardianship, and the guardian of the estate of either has obtained a license from the judge to sell real estate of the ward, the guardian of the other may, without license, join in the sale and release the ward's interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In such case, the proceeds of the sale shall be equitably divided, as the judge may direct, according to the value of the respective interests of the husband and wife in the estate sold, and the respective guardians shall receive and be charged accordingly.
