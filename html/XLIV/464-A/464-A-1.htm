&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote and protect the well-being of the proposed ward in involuntarily imposed protective proceedings.  This chapter is designed to provide procedural and substantive safeguards for civil liberties and property rights of a proposed ward or an individual already under guardianship powers.  It is the further purpose of this chapter to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance in the individual;  to encourage rehabilitative care, rather than custodial care for incapacitated individuals;  and to impose protective orders only to the extent necessitated by the individual's functional limitations.
