&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote and protect the well-being of the proposed ward in involuntarily imposed protective proceedings.  This chapter is designed to provide procedural and substantive safeguards for civil liberties and property rights of a proposed ward or an individual already under guardianship powers.  It is the further purpose of this chapter to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance in the individual;  to encourage rehabilitative care, rather than custodial care for incapacitated individuals;  and to impose protective orders only to the extent necessitated by the individual's functional limitations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:8 Conduct of Hearing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the proposed ward is within the state and able to attend, he or she must be present at the hearing unless excused under the provisions of this chapter.  If the proposed ward is not within the state, but is a resident of the state, and if the court determines that his or her attendance at the hearing is in the best interest of the proposed ward, the court may order him or her to attend the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may waive personal attendance of the proposed ward at the hearing when the petitioner or the counsel for the proposed ward files a written statement with the court at least 24 hours prior to the hearing indicating that the proposed ward does not express a desire to attend the hearing;  provided, however, that upon a showing that the proposed ward first expressed a desire not to attend the hearing at such a time as to make it unreasonable to require the filing of the written statement at least 24 hours prior to the hearing, then the court may waive personal attendance of the proposed ward at the hearing upon the filing of the required written statement at any time up to the time of the hearing.  Any statement filing in connection with a hearing under this paragraph shall include a physician's affidavit indicating that the overall physical, emotional, or psychological condition of the proposed ward is such that he or she is likely to suffer harm or that the proposed ward has no ability to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. If the proposed ward fails to attend the hearing, and if the proposed ward's attendance is not waived by the court under the provisions set forth in paragraph II, the court may continue the hearing and order the proposed ward to attend the continued hearing.  The continued hearing shall be held within 30 days thereafter.  The court may waive personal attendance of the proposed ward at the continued hearing when the petitioner or the counsel for the proposed ward files a written statement with the court at least 24 hours prior to the continued hearing indicating that the proposed ward does not express a desire to attend the continued hearing;  provided, however, that upon a showing that the proposed ward first expressed a desire not to attend the continued hearing at such a time as to make it unreasonable to require the filing of the written statement at least 24 hours prior to the continued hearing, then the court may waive personal attendance of the proposed ward at the continued hearing upon the filing of the required written statement at any time up to the time of the continued hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The medical affidavit shall be evidence only of the proposed ward's inability to attend the hearing and shall not be considered in determining his or her incapacity.  If the proposed ward is a patient at a county nursing home, state hospital or Laconia developmental services, the affidavit shall be by the medical director or medical superintendent of such county nursing home, state hospital, or developmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The rules of evidence shall apply and no hearsay evidence which is not otherwise admissible in a court of law shall be admitted into evidence except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  In such proceedings, there is a legal presumption of capacity, and the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner to prove the allegations set forth in the petition by competent evidence.  Such proof must be established beyond reasonable doubt that the proposed ward is incapacitated and in need of a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A record of the proceedings shall be made if requested by the proposed ward or the proposed ward's attorney, or when ordered by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Records, reports, and evidence submitted to the court or recorded by the court shall be confidential.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The issue as to whether a guardian should be appointed for the proposed ward shall be determined by the court at a closed hearing unless the proposed ward or counsel for the proposed ward otherwise requests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:9 Findings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court, at a hearing convened under this chapter, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Inquire into the nature and extent of the functional limitations of the proposed ward;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Ascertain his or her capacity to care for himself or herself or his or her estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If it is determined that the proposed ward possesses the capacity to care for himself or his estate, the court shall dismiss the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Alternatively, the court may appoint a guardian of the person and estate, or the person or the estate, as requested in the petition and confer specific powers of guardianship on the proposed guardian, or appoint co-guardians, one of the person and one of the estate, after finding in the record based on evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person for whom a guardian is to be appointed is incapacitated;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The guardianship is necessary as a means of providing continuing care, supervision, and rehabilitation of the individual, or the management of the property and financial affairs of the incapacitated person;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) There are no available alternative resources which are suitable with respect to the incapacitated person's welfare, safety, and rehabilitation or the prudent management of his or her property and financial affairs;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The guardianship is appropriate as the least restrictive form of intervention consistent with the preservation of the civil rights and liberties of the proposed ward.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. If a petition is filed pursuant to RSA 464-A:4 for the appointment of a guardian of the person or of the person and the estate for a person admitted for in-patient treatment on an involuntary emergency basis as provided in RSA 135-C:27-33 or on an involuntary basis as provided in RSA 135-C:34-54, the probate court shall render a decision on such petition in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within 45 calendar days of the filing of the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-b. When a petition seeks appointment of a guardian for a limited period of time, the probate court may dismiss the petition, grant the petition, or appoint a guardian for a shorter period of time than sought in the petition.  The court shall not appoint a guardian for a period of time longer than the time sought in the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No person determined to be incapacitated thus requiring the appointment of a guardian of the person and estate, or the person, or the estate, shall be deprived of any legal rights, including the right to marry, to obtain a motor vehicle operator's license, to testify in any judicial or administrative proceedings, to make a will, to convey or hold property, or to contract, except upon specific findings of the court.  The court shall enumerate in its findings which legal rights the proposed ward is incapable of exercising.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No individual shall be committed to any mental health facility or state institution solely because he or she has been declared incompetent for the purpose of appointing a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The court may dismiss the proceedings or enter any other appropriate order consistent with the findings of this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

III. An institution or agency providing care and custody of the incapacitated person may not be appointed guardian, unless no one else can be found to serve as guardian;  then an employee of the institution or agency may be appointed guardian if he or she does not provide direct care to the proposed ward, provided that the court makes a specific finding that such appointment presents no substantial risk of a conflict of interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Any competent person may nominate one or more persons to be guardian of his or her person or estate, or both his or her person and estate, and one or more substitutes in case of a nominee's inability to serve by a written instrument, executed in accordance with the requirements of RSA 477:9, and may name in such instrument any persons, other than a public guardianship and protection program, the person wishes to exclude from consideration as guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(e) This paragraph shall be construed to create a rebuttable presumption that the person nominated as guardian shall be so appointed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) This paragraph shall not be construed to limit the ability of the court to remove any guardian appointed under this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:12 Temporary Guardian. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any relative, public official, or interested person may file a verified petition for a temporary guardian of the person and estate, or the person, or the estate.  Said petition shall contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All the information required in RSA 464-A:4;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The reasons the petitioner believes the proposed ward is in need of a temporary guardian;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The reasons why the petitioner believes the regular procedure for obtaining guardianship of the person and estate, or the person, or the estate, is not appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may, with such notice as it deems reasonable to the proposed ward and the court appointed counsel or the proposed ward's private counsel, appoint a temporary guardian for an incapacitated person.  The appointment shall be limited to the performance of duties respecting specific property, or to the performance of particular acts necessary to prevent immediate serious physical or mental harm to the proposed ward or immediate serious physical harm to others.  The temporary guardian of the person and estate, or the estate, shall file an inventory within 30 days after the termination of the guardianship, or be in default.  The temporary guardian shall file an account within 90 days after the termination of the guardianship, or be in default.  Within 10 days after the temporary guardian's default, the clerk shall give notice to the fiduciary of the default by first class mail.  The temporary guardian shall not file an annual report.  No term of temporary guardianship shall exceed 60 days, unless for good cause shown and within the discretion of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No temporary guardian shall seek an extension of that appointment without formally petitioning the court for a guardianship of the person and estate, or the person, or estate within the 60 day period of temporary guardianship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the counsel for the proposed ward or the proposed ward opposes the appointment of a temporary guardian under this section, the court may not appoint said temporary guardian without a hearing pursuant to RSA 464-A:8 and without findings pursuant to RSA 464-A:9.  The proposed temporary guardian, the petitioner, the proposed ward, and the counsel for the proposed ward shall be present at said hearing and the court shall determine the necessity for the appointment of a temporary guardian.  The burden of proof to show need for a temporary guardian shall be on the petitioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Appointment of a temporary guardian shall not have the effect of an adjudication of incapacity or effect of limitation on the legal rights of the individual other than those specified in the court order.  Appointment of a temporary guardian shall not be evidence of incapacity in the petition, hearing or finding, for regular guardianship powers under RSA 464-A:4, 464-A:8 and 464-A:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The appointment of a guardian pursuant to RSA 464-A:9 terminates the powers of a temporary guardian appointed under this section, except for the rendering of the final account of the temporary guardian.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:25 General Powers and Duties of Guardian of the Person. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A guardian of an incapacitated person has the following powers and duties, except as modified by order of the court:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward, the guardian shall be entitled to custody of the ward and may establish the ward's place of abode within or without this state.  Admission to a state institution shall be in accordance with the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A guardian may admit a ward to a state institution with prior approval of the probate court if, following notice and hearing, the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the placement is in the ward's best interest and is the least restrictive placement available.  Authorization for such admission shall not be time limited unless the court so orders.  Authority to admit a ward to a state institution with prior approval under this subparagraph shall not be subject to the limitations contained in RSA 464-A:25, I(a)(2) through (7).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A guardian may admit a ward to a state institution without prior approval of the probate court upon written certification by a physician licensed in the state of New Hampshire, or, in the case of placement in New Hampshire hospital, by a psychiatrist licensed in the state of New Hampshire, or an advanced practice registered nurse, as defined in RSA 135-C:2, II-a, that the placement is in the ward's best interest and is the least restrictive placement available.  Within 36 hours, excluding days when the court is closed, of such an admission of a ward to a state institution, the guardian shall submit to the Merrimack county probate court notice of the admission and the reasons therefor, together with a copy of the certificate by the physician, psychiatrist, or advanced practice registered nurse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The Merrimack county probate court shall review the guardian's notice within 48 hours of the filing of the notice, excluding days when the court is closed, to determine whether the notice on its face appears to establish that the placement is in the ward's best interest and is the least restrictive placement available.  If the court concludes that the notice is insufficient, the court shall order the immediate release of the ward from the state institution.  If the court concludes that the notice is sufficient, counsel for the ward shall be appointed no later than 48 hours following the court's review of the guardian's notice, excluding days when the court is closed.  Notice of the appointment shall be transmitted to the ward, to the guardian, and to counsel.  Counsel's notice shall be transmitted in writing and electronically or in another manner which is likely to give actual notice of the appointment to counsel at the earliest practicable time.  For purposes of proceedings regarding admissions to state institutions without prior court approval, the ward shall have the right to legal counsel in the same manner as provided in RSA 464-A:6.  The court shall also provide the ward a notice stating that the ward has the right to appointed counsel, the right to oppose the admission by the guardian, and the right to a hearing and to present evidence at that hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Counsel for a ward admitted to a state institution who has been appointed pursuant to subparagraph (3) shall deliver a written report to the court within 5 days of his or her appointment which shall declare whether the ward requests a hearing on the propriety of the admission.  Unless the ward waives a hearing, counsel's report shall include a request for a hearing on behalf of the ward.  A copy of counsel's report shall be sent to the ward and to the guardian.  If the court does not receive a written report from counsel within 5 days of counsel's appointment, the court shall order appropriate relief, including but not limited to substitution of counsel, an order to show cause, or scheduling of a hearing on the propriety of the admission without awaiting a report from counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the court shall schedule a hearing on the admission to a state institution without prior approval of the probate court, at which the guardian shall have the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the placement is in the ward's best interest and is the least restrictive placement available.  The hearing shall be held within 10 days, excluding days when the court is closed, from the date that the request is received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A guardian may not admit a ward to a state institution for more than 60 days for any single admission or more than 90 days in any 12-month period upon certification of a physician or psychiatrist, or an advanced practice registered nurse, as defined in RSA 135-C:2, II-a, without filing a petition requesting approval of the probate court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) At any time, the ward or counsel for the ward may request a hearing on the admission to a state institution without prior approval of the probate court, at which the guardian shall have the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the placement is in the ward's best interest and is the least restrictive placement available.  The hearing shall be held within 15 days, excluding days when the court is closed, from the date that the hearing is requested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If entitled to custody of the ward, a guardian shall make provision for the care, comfort and maintenance of the ward, and, whenever appropriate, arrange for the ward's training, education or rehabilitation.  The guardian shall take reasonable care of the ward's clothing and personal effects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A guardian shall file an annual report with the probate court, unless the court finds that such report is not necessary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:26 General Powers and Duties of Guardian of the Estate. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The guardian of the estate shall take possession of all of the ward's real and personal property, and of all rents, income, and benefits therefrom, whether accruing before or after his or her appointment, and of the proceeds arising from the sale, mortgage, lease or exchange thereof.  Subject to such possession, the title of all such estate and to the increment and proceeds thereof shall be in the ward and not in the guardian.  It is the duty of the guardian of the estate to protect and preserve it, to retain, sell and invest it as hereinafter provided, to prosecute or defend actions, claims or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of the estate's assets, to account for it faithfully, to perform all other duties required by law, and at the termination of the guardianship to deliver the assets of the ward to the persons entitled thereto.  The guardian of the estate shall apply the money and property for the support, care, and education of the ward, but, the guardian may not use funds from the ward's estate for room and board which the guardian or his or her spouse, parent, or child have furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by order of the court made upon notice to at least one of the next of kin of the ward, if notice is possible.  The guardian may institute proceedings to compel any person or agency under a duty to support the ward, or a duty to pay sums for the welfare of the ward, to perform this duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as limited by statute or order of the court, the guardian of the estate shall have the power to perform, without court authorization, every act which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence and exercising judgment and care as in the management of their own affairs would perform for the purposes of the guardianship, including, but not limited to, the powers specified in RSA 564-B:8-816.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every guardian shall take a receipt of the ward or of his or her legal representative, to whom the guardian shall pay or deliver the property of the ward, and shall file the same in the probate office, to be there recorded and preserved.  The time of its being so filed shall be certified upon the clerk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any guardian may be cited by the judge for failure to file such receipt in the probate office.  If he neglects or refuses to do so he may be found in contempt and fined up to $5 per day, unless the judge, after a hearing, shall certify the reason of the omission to be sufficient.  All fines collected under this section shall be for the benefit of the county in which the fine is paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A guardian of the estate shall be required to file an annual account with the probate court pursuant to this chapter, unless the court finds that it is not appropriate.  The court may limit the powers of the guardian of the estate or impose additional duties if it deems such action desirable in the best interests of the ward.  With respect to guardians of the estate appointed pursuant to RSA 464-A:42, the court may limit the duties of the guardian of the estate if it deems such actions appropriate in the best interests of the child.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:26-a Estate Planning by Guardian. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The probate court may authorize the guardian of the estate to make lifetime gifts, to allocate income, and/or to plan for the testamentary distribution of the ward's estate consistent with the ward's wishes.  If the ward's wishes cannot be ascertained, the probate court may authorize the guardian of the estate to plan for the testamentary distribution of the ward's estate in order to minimize taxation or to facilitate distribution of the ward's estate to family, friends, or charities who would be likely recipients of gifts from the ward.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before authorizing a guardian to make lifetime gifts or to allocate income, the probate court shall consider the ward's present and anticipated future expenses for maintenance, support, and medical care, any current or future debts of the ward, and any duty or legal obligation of the ward to support a spouse or dependent family members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The guardian of the estate shall petition the probate court for authorization to make lifetime gifts, to allocate income, and/or to plan for the testamentary distribution of the ward's estate.  This petition shall include the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A description of the proposed action;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The anticipated results including any income, estate, or inheritance tax savings, and, if the gift is being made in order to qualify the ward for Medicaid, whether the action will maximize payments by Medicaid for the ward's care or result in a period of Medicaid disqualification;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The ward's wishes, if known;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The ward's financial condition, including present and anticipated future expenses for maintenance, support, and medical care, debts, and support obligations;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The ward's medical condition;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The ward's prior estate planning action, including significant life-time gifts, will, beneficiary designations, joint ownership, or trusts;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The ward's family situation, including the family members who would inherit from the ward if the ward dies intestate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Whether the gift is intended to reduce the ward's assets or income in order to qualify the ward for Medicaid or other governmental benefits;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The ward's housing situation during the 12 months prior to the filing of the petition;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A description of the care and services that the ward requires and is currently receiving.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notice of the petition shall be given to all interested parties, including the ward, the intended donees or beneficiaries of the contemplated estate plan, family members who would inherit from the ward if the ward died intestate, beneficiaries under current estate planning documents or contracts, the attorney for the ward, and such other parties as the court directs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Before authorizing the guardian to make lifetime gifts or to plan for the testamentary distribution of the ward's estate, the probate court must find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the proposed gifts and/or testamentary plan are consistent with the ward's wishes or, based on the circumstances as they then exist, that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The testamentary distribution of the ward's estate will minimize taxation and/or facilitate distribution of the ward's estate to family, friends, or charities who would be likely recipients of gifts from the ward;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The proposed gift is not likely to adversely affect the ward's housing options, access to care and services, or general welfare;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The proposed gift does not create a foreseeable risk that the ward will be deprived of sufficient assets to cover his or her needs during any period of Medicaid ineligibility that would result from the proposed gift;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The proposed gift is not likely to result in premature or unnecessary nursing home placement or institutionalization of the ward, or compromise the ward's access to care or services in the least restrictive setting in which his or her needs can be met.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The probate court, prior to authorizing a lifetime gift or an allocation of income to the ward's spouse, shall appoint a guardian ad litem if the proposed gift benefits the guardian personally or otherwise creates a potential conflict of interest between the ward's interests and the guardian's personal interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The department of health and human services, the county attorney, and the department of justice shall be notified and shall have the opportunity to address the court in any proceeding under this section if the court has concerns relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The impact on the ward of any period of Medicaid ineligibility that would result from the proposed gift;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whether the ward has been the victim of a crime or has been or is at risk of being abused, neglected, or exploited within the meaning of RSA 161-F:43;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The cost of the ward's care to be paid by Medicaid as the result of the proposed gift or income reallocation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 464-A:40 Termination of Guardianship. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A guardianship of the person or of the estate shall terminate upon order of the court, the death of the ward, or upon a finding by the court that the ward is no longer incapacitated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The ward or any person interested in the ward's welfare may, at any time, file a motion for the termination of the guardianship based upon a finding that the ward is no longer incapacitated.  Provided, however, an order adjudicating incapacity may specify a minimum period, not exceeding one year, during which no motion concerning such adjudication may be filed without special leave.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A ward may request the termination of the guardianship based on a finding that he or she is no longer incapacitated in an informal letter to the court or judge.  Persons directly responsible for the care and supervision of the ward may assist the ward in preparing a letter of this kind.  Any person who knowingly interferes with a transmission made by, or on behalf of, a ward to the court or judge may be adjudged guilty of contempt of court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless the motion is without merit, the court shall hold a hearing similar to that provided for in RSA 464-A:8 and RSA 464-A:9 at which the guardian shall be required to prove that the grounds for appointment of a guardian provided in RSA 464-A:9 continue to exist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon termination of a guardianship of the estate, the guardian shall file a final account with the court within 90 days after the date of termination, or as ordered by the court.  When the guardianship is terminated as a result of the ward's death, the guardian shall include a copy of the death certificate.  Upon approval of the account, the guardian shall be discharged and his or her bond released.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon termination of a guardianship of the person resulting from the death of the ward, the guardian shall provide a copy of the death certificate to the court within 30 days of the ward's death.  Upon receipt of the death certificate, the guardian shall be discharged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) If, within 30 days after the date of a testate or intestate ward's death, no petition for probate has been filed under any section of RSA 553 and the gross value of the personal property remaining in the possession of the guardian belonging to the deceased, including any amount left in designated accounts for the ward, is no more than $5,000, the guardian may file in the probate court in the county having jurisdiction over the guardianship an affidavit for the purpose of disposing of such deceased ward's estate.  Once approved by the court, the guardian shall be authorized to dispose of the ward's accounts in a manner consistent with the court's order.  The form of the affidavit, and the rules governing proceedings under this section, shall be provided by the probate court pursuant to RSA 547:33.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the ward died testate and if the guardian has the will or a copy of the will, the guardian shall file the will or copy of the will and a death certificate with the probate court having jurisdiction where the ward resided at the time of the ward's death pursuant to RSA 552:2.  A copy of the will also shall be filed in the probate court having jurisdiction over the guardianship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the deceased ward has known debts, the probate court may order the guardian to pay such debts to those creditors in the order of priority pursuant to RSA 554:19.  If all known debts of the deceased have been paid and a balance remains in the designated accounts for the ward after the filing required under subparagraph (a), the probate court may order the guardian to pay the balance to the ward's beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of the ward's will, or if the ward had no will, to those heirs who would inherit pursuant to RSA 561:1.  The probate court may also order the guardian to pay the balance to the state treasurer to be held as abandoned property pursuant to RSA 471-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any guardian, or any organization providing guardianship or other fiduciary services to any individual under the public guardianship and protection program pursuant to RSA 547-B, may petition the probate court to dispose of any non-guardianship accounts, to include but not limited to social security representative payee accounts, and the probate court may authorize the release and distribution of such funds pursuant to the terms of this paragraph.
