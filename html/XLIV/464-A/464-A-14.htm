<codesect>
If the court determines that the person to be protected has voluntarily applied for appointment of a conservator and has voluntarily nominated his conservator, the court may appoint the nominee as conservator for the person to be protected.  If, for good cause shown at the hearing, the court determines that appointment of the proposed conservator is not in the best interests of the person to be protected, the court shall have the authority to nominate another person as conservator and, with the approval of the person to be protected, appoint said person as conservator.
