&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the purpose of this chapter to secure for a minor an environment of stability and security by providing for the appointment of a guardian of the person when such appointment is in the best interests of the minor;  and to provide for the appointment of a guardian of the estate for the proper management of the property and financial affairs of the minor.  This chapter is designed to provide procedural and substantive safeguards for the rights of parents and their minor children.  Implicit in this chapter shall be the recognition that the interests of a minor are generally best promoted in the minor's own home unless the best interests of the minor require substitution or supplementation of parental care and supervision.

<center><h3>Section 463:7</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463:7 Ex Parte and Temporary Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon entry of a petition seeking guardianship of the person or of the estate or both of a minor, the court may issue orders for ex parte and temporary guardianship as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Ex parte orders may issue at any time prior to notice to the persons required to receive notice under RSA 463:6, I on a petition or request asking for such relief which includes a sworn affidavit or verified pleading alleging facts involving the circumstances of the minor which establish that unless the ex parte relief is granted the minor will or is likely to suffer immediate or irreparable harm or injury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If temporary orders are made ex parte, the party against whom the orders are issued may file a written request with the court and request a hearing.  Such a hearing shall be held no later than 5 days after the request is received by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), any ex parte order entered expires 30 days after the date of the order;  however, any ex parte order may be extended pending notice on persons required to receive notice under RSA 463:6, I if the party or parties seeking guardianship or appointed guardian ex parte provide proof satisfactory to the court that they have undertaken a due and diligent effort to provide the court with the names and addresses of those persons required to receive notice under RSA 463:6, I.  In the event of such an extension, the court may enter such limitations on the extension as it deems reasonable and appropriate.  Any further extension shall be only upon like request and proof.  In the case of any extension, the court shall enter an express finding that the petitioner or petitioners for guardianship, or the person or persons appointed ex parte, have made a due and diligent effort to provide the court with the names and addresses of those persons required to receive notice under RSA 463:6, I and that the minor is still at risk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Temporary orders may be entered pending hearing and ruling on the merits, provided, however, that no temporary order shall carry with it any presumptive weight in the court's adjudication of the merits or affect the legal rights of the parent other than as specified in the court order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon the entry of a petition seeking guardianship of the person accompanied by a nomination document and activation orders pursuant to RSA 463:18-a, the court shall issue temporary orders appointing the individual nominated guardian pending a hearing and ruling on the merits;  but for cause, the court may appoint some other suitable individual temporary guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Ex parte or temporary orders issued may include the appointment of a guardian or co-guardian, injunctive relief, support orders, restraining orders, visitation orders, or such other orders as the court may enter on the merits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any ex parte or temporary orders entered by the court may be modified for cause upon petition or the court's own motion and such notice as the court may deem reasonable or appropriate.

<center><h3>Section 463:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463:8 Conduct of Hearing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In any hearing under this chapter, the court shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence and may admit evidence which it considers relevant and material.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A minor 14 years of age or older shall attend the hearing unless attendance is excused by the court.  All other minors may attend the hearing if authorized or ordered by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Except as set forth in subparagraph (b), the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a guardianship of the person is in the best interests of the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a parent objects to the establishment of the guardianship of the person requested by a non-parent, the court shall set a date for the hearing specified in this section.  The burden of proof shall be on the petitioner to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the minor require substitution or supplementation of parental care and supervision to provide for the essential physical and safety needs of the minor or to prevent specific, significant psychological harm to the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The burden of proof shall be on the petitioner for the guardianship of the estate of a minor to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the guardianship is necessary to provide for the proper management of the property and financial affairs of the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The consent of the minor shall not be necessary for the appointment of a guardian, but the court shall in all cases ascertain the minor's preference, and give to it such weight as under the circumstances may seem just.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When before or during the hearing on any proceeding in any court it appears to the court that the interest or rights of a minor are not fully represented or upon the request of any interested person, the court may appoint a competent and disinterested person to act as guardian ad litem for such minor to represent the minor's interest in the case.  The guardian ad litem shall have none of the rights of the general guardian.  The person appointed guardian ad litem shall make an oath to perform such duty faithfully and impartially.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A guardian ad litem appointed in a child custody proceeding in the probate court or family division shall be subject to the same standards, requirements, and rules as apply to guardians ad litem appointed in divorce, nullity, or legal separation proceedings under RSA 458:17-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The court may appoint a guardian of the person or of the estate or of both as requested if, upon hearing, it finds based on the applicable burden of proof:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of guardianship of the person, guardianship is in the best interests of the minor as provided in paragraph III and the person nominated is appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of guardianship of the estate, that the guardianship is necessary to provide for the proper management of the property and financial affairs of the minor and the person nominated is appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If a parent objects to the appointment or continuation of a guardianship, the court shall issue written findings concerning the petitioner's compliance with the relevant burden of proof under paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If a parent consents to the appointment of a guardianship, such consent shall be executed by an instrument in writing, signed by the parent, in the presence and with the approval of the court of the county in which the case is pending.  The court may designate a person or another court to take the parent's consent on the court's behalf for good cause shown.  The court, or its designee, shall also question the consenting parent regarding his or her understanding and knowledge of the nature and consequences if the petition is granted;  and to insure that the parent understands he or she has the right to contest the petition.  If the court, based on its own determination or its duly certified designee, finds:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That consent is being given voluntarily and knowingly, the court may conduct a hearing pursuant to this section and thereon make all orders authorized by this chapter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That consent is not being given voluntarily and knowingly for any reason such as because the parent lacked the mental capacity to give such consent.  In this case, the court may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Hold a hearing pursuant to this section within 6 months, or earlier, if it is reasonably likely that the parent's mental capacity will be restored within a shorter time period, and during the interim make or renew whatever temporary orders under RSA 463:7 the court deems necessary;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If it is unlikely that capacity will be restored within 6 months, schedule and conduct a hearing pursuant to this section as if the parent were objecting under paragraph III and make or renew whatever temporary orders under RSA 463:7 the court deems necessary until the hearing is conducted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If the parent does not appear at the hearing and the court has not received a properly and duly executed consent form, the court may conduct such hearing as necessary to make the determinations required by this section and thereon make all orders authorized by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. When the court grants guardianship as part of the permanency plan for a child in the department's custody pursuant to the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, Public Law 105-89, the court shall so specify in its order.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise expanded or limited by statute or order of court as provided in paragraph IV a guardian of the person of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent regarding the minor's support, care and education, but a guardian is not personally liable for the minor's expenses and is not liable to third persons by reason of the relationship for acts of the minor.  The guardian shall not be liable for injury to the minor resulting from the negligent acts or omissions of third persons unless a parent would have been liable in the same circumstances.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Report the condition of the minor and of the minor's estate that has been subject to the guardian's possession or control, as ordered by the court on petition of any person interested in the minor's welfare or as required by court rule.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463:13 Order for Support for the Benefit of a Minor Under Guardianship and Visitation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The appointment of a guardian over the person or over the estate of a minor shall not relieve the minor's parents or any other persons liable for the support of the minor from their obligation to provide for such support.  The court, at the time of such appointment, or at any time thereafter, may order and require such parent, parents, or other persons to contribute to the support and maintenance of the minor in such amounts and at such times as the court determines to be just and reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may from time to time, upon application of the guardian or any other party interested, and notice to the party having the duty to provide support, revise, or alter such order, or to make such new order or decree as the circumstances of the party or parties having the duty to support and maintain or the benefit of the minor may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The court may award reasonable visitation rights to the parent or parents.  The presumption shall be in favor of liberal visitation rights absent a showing of harm to the minor.  If a party wishes to have any pre-existing court visitation orders incorporated into the guardianship order, that party has the burden of providing said visitation orders to the court for its consideration.  The court shall incorporate such visitation orders in its order, unless there has been a change in circumstances that warrants different visitation arrangements.  In guardianships granted as part of the permanency plan for a child previously in the department's custody pursuant to the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, Public Law 105-89, the court may give the guardian discretion to determine visitation.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A guardianship of the person or of the estate of a minor shall terminate upon order of the court, the death of the minor, the minor's eighteenth birthday, a finding by the court that the minor has been emancipated under relevant state law, or upon the issuance of a final decree of adoption.  The guardian shall provide written notice to the court of termination resulting from the death of the minor, or the minor's eighteenth birthday, within 30 days of the event giving rise to termination.  Failure to provide timely notice does not imply consent to the extension of jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, the court may, with the continuing consent of the minor, retain jurisdiction over a minor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For whom the department has recommended extension of the court's jurisdiction;

(D) Dies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The department revokes its consent to extended jurisdiction in writing and the revocation is accepted by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The court shall approve the minor's revocation of consent if it finds that the minor, in seeking to do so, is acting intelligently, knowledgeably and in acceptance of the legal consequences.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Upon activation, the individual nominated guardian shall petition for appointment of a guardian of the person of the minor within 7 days in the county where the parent or legal guardian was residing upon activation.  The petitioner shall append to the petition copies of the nomination document and the member's activation orders.  The petition for appointment of a guardian shall be processed, heard, and adjudicated in the same manner as other guardianships filed under this chapter.  All fees for the filing of the petition for the appointment of a guardian under this section shall be waived.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the minor is the subject of a pre-activation custodial court order from this or any other state, any non-guardianship related custodial order entered after activation but before deactivation of the member shall be temporary and shall not prejudice the pre-activation custodial order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Know all persons that I __________, currently residing at __________, by this document do consent to the appointment of __________, whose address is __________, as the guardian of my minor child, thereby submitting to the jurisdiction of the court and waiving notice of the petition.  This document shall grant the person nominated the same powers and duties of a guardian of the person under RSA 463:12 for 7 days from the date of my activation or until the probate court grants a guardianship, whichever is sooner.  A copy of my activation orders must accompany this document for it to be valid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The parent or legal guardian's signature shall be witnessed by a third party and the signatures of the witness and parent or legal guardian shall be acknowledged by a notary public.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463:19 General Powers and Duties of a Guardian of the Estate of a Minor. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the guardian of the estate shall take possession of all of the minor's real and personal property, and of all rents, incomes, and benefits from such property, whether accruing before or after appointment, and of the proceeds arising from the sale, mortgage, lease, or exchange of such property.  Subject to such possession, the title of all such estate, and to the increment and proceeds thereof, shall be in the minor or in the guardian on behalf of the minor.  It is the duty of the guardian of the estate to protect and preserve it, to retain, sell, and invest it as provided in this subdivision, to prosecute or defend actions, claims, or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of the estate's assets, to account for it faithfully, to perform all other duties required by law, and at the termination of the guardianship to deliver the assets of the minor to the persons entitled to such assets.  The guardian may institute proceedings to compel any person or agency under a duty to support the minor, or duty to pay sums or to provide benefits for the welfare of the minor, to perform the duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as limited by statute or order of the court, the guardian of the estate shall have the power to perform, without court authorization, every act which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence and exercising judgment and care as in the management of their own affairs would perform for the purposes of the guardianship, including but not limited to, the powers specified in RSA 564-B:8-816.  The guardian of the estate, with court authorization, shall have the power to create and fund a trust, to terminate at some time after the termination of the guardianship, for the benefit of the minor into which all or part of such minor's estate may be transferred.  Except in the case of a special needs trust as defined in RSA 564-B:5-505, the trust shall not continue beyond the twenty-fifth birthday of the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The guardian of the estate shall file an inventory of the estate of the minor in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as inventories of the estates of persons deceased are made pursuant to RSA 554.  An appraisal of all or any part of the minor's estate shall be made whenever ordered by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every guardian of the estate shall take a receipt of the minor or of the minor's legal representative, to whom the guardian shall pay or deliver the property of the minor, and shall file the same with the court.  Any guardian may be cited by the court for failure to file such receipt.  If the guardian neglects or refuses to do so, the guardian may be found in contempt and fined up to $5 per day.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The guardian of the estate shall file with the court an annual account of administration and management of the guardianship estate, within 90 days after the anniversary date of the guardianship appointment unless otherwise ordered by the court.  The account shall specify the amount and type of real and personal property received, remaining in the guardian's control, and invested by the guardian and the nature of such investment, and the guardian's receipts of money disbursed and expenditures, during the preceding time.  Upon request of the court, the guardian shall produce for examination by the court, all securities, evidences of deposit, and investments reported, and any other information or documentation which the court may consider relevant to the accounting of the financial and property transactions of the estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The court may limit or restrict the powers of the guardian of the estate or impose additional duties if it deems them desirable in the best interests of the minor or of the minor's estate.
