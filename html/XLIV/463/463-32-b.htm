I. Any person who has been appointed guardian of the person or estate or both, by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, for a minor who has become a resident of this state, or who intends to move to this state, shall be accorded the powers of guardianship as reflected in the order appointing the guardian, with full faith and credit, for a period of time not exceeding 120 days following the date of the ward's residence in this state.  If a petition for transfer of the guardianship is filed within 120 days of the date of the minor's residence in this state, such guardianship shall continue until an order is issued on the petition for transfer.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All procedure and notice requirements in RSA 463:5 and 463:6 shall apply to a petition to transfer an existing guardianship;  except that the statement required in RSA 463:5, V shall be limited to the reason or reasons for the transfer of the guardianship.
