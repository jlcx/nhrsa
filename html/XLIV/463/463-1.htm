&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the purpose of this chapter to secure for a minor an environment of stability and security by providing for the appointment of a guardian of the person when such appointment is in the best interests of the minor;  and to provide for the appointment of a guardian of the estate for the proper management of the property and financial affairs of the minor.  This chapter is designed to provide procedural and substantive safeguards for the rights of parents and their minor children.  Implicit in this chapter shall be the recognition that the interests of a minor are generally best promoted in the minor's own home unless the best interests of the minor require substitution or supplementation of parental care and supervision.
