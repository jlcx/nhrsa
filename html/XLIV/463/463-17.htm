&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 463:17 Periodic Court Review. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The status of all minors for whom guardianship or co-guardianship has been granted shall be reviewed by the court at 6, 12, and 24 months and annually thereafter, except that the court may waive (1) any or all reviews in cases in which a parent or the parents are co-guardians and (2) any or all reviews in all other cases after the 24-month review upon good cause shown.  The guardian shall file a report with the court on or before each review date.  The parent may file a statement or report with the court on or before each review date.  The court may also, as part of the review, conduct a hearing on its own motion, or upon the request of a parent or guardian who seeks to substantially change the existing orders upon a showing by the parent that he or she has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing, if allowed a hearing.  If termination of the guardianship is sought as part of the review proceeding, the burdens and standards of proof set forth in RSA 463:15 shall apply.  Failure of any party to appear at any hearing held under this section without good cause, shall not cause the hearing to be continued.
