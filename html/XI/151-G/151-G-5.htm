&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
All information of any type submitted to or collected by the commission, including, but not limited to, written, oral, and electronic information;  records and proceedings of the commission, including, but not limited to, oral testimony and discussions, notes, minutes, summaries, analyses, and reports;  and information disseminated by the commission or its members to acute care hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial, administrative, or other type of proceeding.  The provision of information to the commission and the dissemination of information by the commission shall not be deemed to void, waive, or impair in any manner the confidentiality protection of this section or which the information may have under any other law or regulation.  However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources shall not be construed as immune from discovery or use in any civil or administrative action merely because they were presented to the commission.  Furthermore, any person who supplies information to or testifies before the commission shall not be immune from discovery in such civil or administrative action because the information or testimony was presented to the commission, but such witness shall not be asked about and shall not provide information about his or her testimony before this commission or opinions formed by him or her as a result of commission participation.
