<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department may petition the court for the appointment of a receiver, after notification to the governor and the attorney general, requesting the appointment of a receiver to operate a facility.  Before the department files such a petition, the commissioner shall consult with a facility administrator.  The administrator shall have appropriate experience as a nursing home or other residential care facility administrator and shall have no financial ties or affiliation with the facility that is the subject of the proposed receivership.  When the petition concerns a nursing home, the administrator shall be chosen from a list provided by the New Hampshire Health Care Association.  The administrator may submit his or her recommendations concerning the facility proposed for receivership within 2 business days after receiving all relevant information from the commissioner.  The consulting administrator shall be immune from any damages action arising out of these recommendations.  After the 2-day period, the department, in its sole discretion may file a petition with the court.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as abrogating or superseding any common law or statutory right of any person to bring an action requesting appointment of a receiver to operate a facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court shall immediately issue a summons and set the matter for hearing not less than 5 days and not more than 14 days after filing of the action.  The petition and notice of the hearing shall be served on the licensee, the owner or owners, and the administrator not less than 3 days before the date of the hearing, unless a different period is specified by the court.  A receiver may be appointed immediately, on an ex parte basis, if the court renders written findings of fact and conclusions of law that clear and convincing evidence exists, based upon a petition filed by the department with supporting affidavit, that there are legally sufficient grounds for the appointment of a receiver in that an immediate appointment is necessary to prevent immediate, irreparable harm to the residents, and that there are no adequate remedies available at law.  The licensee, the owner or owners, and the administrator shall be given prior notice of the ex parte hearing unless such notice is impossible given exigent circumstances for the health, safety, or welfare of the residents or if, after exercising all reasonable means, the department is unable to locate the licensee, the owner or owners, and or the administrator.  If a receiver is appointed on an ex parte basis, service shall be made on the responding parties and a hearing held within 5 days of the date the order was issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The court shall appoint as a receiver any person appearing on a list of names maintained by the commissioner.  The list for purposes of receiverships involving nursing homes shall be established by the New Hampshire Health Care Association and provided to the commissioner.  If those persons are unwilling or unable to serve, the commissioner may provide other appropriate candidates' names to the court.  Persons appearing on any such list shall have experience in the delivery of health care services, and, if feasible, shall have experience with the operation of long-term care facilities.  A receiver shall not have a financial interest in or any affiliation with the facility that is the subject of the receivership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The purpose of a receivership created under this section shall be to safeguard the health, safety, and continuity of care to residents and to protect them from the adverse health effects and increased risk of death caused by abrupt or unsuitable transfer of residents.  A receiver appointed under this section shall not take any actions or assume any responsibilities inconsistent with this purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No person shall impede the operation of a receivership created under this section.  There shall be an automatic stay for a 60-day period subsequent to the appointment of a receiver, of any action that would interfere with the functioning of the facility, including but not limited to cancellation of insurance policies executed by the licensee, termination of utility services, attachments or set-offs of resident trust funds and working capital accounts, and repossession of equipment used in the facility.
