The receiver shall have the same rights to possession of the building in which the facility is located and to all goods and fixtures in the building at the time the petition for receivership is filed as the licensee would have had if the receiver had not been appointed.  The receiver shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to preserve the property or assets of the residents, the owner or owners, and the licensee, and may use them only in the performance of the receiver's powers and duties set forth in this section and by order of the court.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. With the approval of the court, the receiver shall have authority to remedy violations of federal and state law and regulations governing the operation of the facility;  to hire, direct, manage, and discharge any consultant or employees, including the administrator of the facility;  to receive and expend in a reasonable and prudent manner the revenues of the facility;  to continue the business of the facility and the care of the residents;  to perform those acts necessary or desirable to accomplish the purpose of the receivership;  to perform regular accountings and make periodic reports to the court;  and to exercise such additional powers and perform such additional duties, as the court may deem appropriate.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The receiver shall apply the current revenues of the facility to current operating expenses and, subject to the following provisions, to debts incurred by the licensee prior to the appointment of the receiver.  The receiver shall motion the court for a ruling on the treatment of debts incurred prior to this appointment where such debts appear extraordinary, of questionable validity, or unrelated to the normal and expected maintenance and operation of the facility, or where payment of such debts will interfere with the purposes of the receivership.  Priority shall be given by the receiver to expenditures for current, direct resident care, including nursing care, medications, social services, dietary services, and housekeeping.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. Revenues held by or owing to the receiver in connection with the operation of the facility shall be exempt from attachment and trustee process.  Any retroactive payment that may be due or owing to the facility as the result of a retroactive rate adjustment shall be disposed of in accordance with the orders of the court as provided in paragraph III of this section, after consideration of competing claims to said payments.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. The receiver may make repairs to the facility but only to the extent necessary to prevent or remove jeopardy to the health, safety, or welfare of the residents or to minimally qualify the facility for continuing participation in the Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, or in the Medicare program, under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act;  provided that the total cost of repair does not exceed $3,000.  Expenditures for this purpose in excess of $3,000 may be made by agreement of all parties or upon order of the court after motion by the receiver.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. In the event that the facility does not have sufficient capital for major repairs or improvements, the receiver may petition the court for permission to apply to the department for a loan through the department's civil monetary penalty fund.  Notice shall be given to the licensee, the owner or owners, the administrator, the department, and to any mortgagee and other secured parties and lienholders of record.  After a hearing on the merits, the court shall authorize the receiver to apply for such assistance if it determines by clear and convincing evidence, and after certification from the commissioner, that the repair or improvement is necessary to prevent or remove jeopardy to residents or to minimally qualify the facility for participation in the Medicaid or Medicare program;  or it determines that the repair or improvement is necessary to prevent jeopardy to residents for the limited period of time that they are awaiting transfer of the residents.  The purposes of this paragraph shall be to protect residents and to continue the viable operations of the facility.  This paragraph shall not be used as a method of financing major repairs or capital improvements to facilities which have been abandoned because the licensee has been unable to secure financing by conventional means.  Upon court approval, application for financial assistance shall be made to the department, which shall administer such funds as the legislature may appropriate for this purpose.  The court may set a reasonable rate of interest to be paid by the receiver to the department.
