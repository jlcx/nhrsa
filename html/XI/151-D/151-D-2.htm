&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Records of an ambulatory care clinic's quality assurance program, including those of its functional components and committees as defined by the organization's quality assurance plans, organized to evaluate matters relating to the care and treatment of patients and to improve the quality of care provided, and testimony by members on the board of directors of the ambulatory care clinic, medical and clinical staff, employees, or other committee attendees relating to activities of the quality assurance program shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.  However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as immune from discovery or use in any such civil or administrative action merely because they were presented to a quality assurance program, and any person who supplies information or testifies as part of a quality assurance program, or who is a member of a quality assurance program committee, may not be prevented from testifying as to matters within his or her knowledge, but such witness may not be asked about his or her testimony before such program, or opinions formed by him or her, as a result of committee participation.  Further, a program's records shall be discoverable in either of the following cases:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A judicial or administrative proceeding brought by an ambulatory care clinic, its quality assurance program, or its board of directors, to revoke or restrict the license, certification, or privileges of a physician or staff member;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A proceeding alleging repetitive malicious action and personal injury brought against a physician or staff member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An ambulatory care clinic board of directors or trustees, or in the case of the division of medical and psychiatric services, the commissioner of the department of corrections, may waive the privilege under this section and release information or present records of the quality assurance program by discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No owner, director, trustee, medical or clinical staff, employee, or other attendees of the quality assurance program shall be held liable in any action for damages or other relief arising from the providing of information to a quality assurance program or in any judicial or administrative proceeding.
