<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a standard of need, which precludes additional services, has existed for longer than 24 months, any person may request that the standard be reviewed to determine whether the standard should be continued.  The 24-month requirement may be waived if it can be demonstrated that there has been a change in technology, market, or price which would warrant review of the standard.  Notwithstanding RSA 541-A:4, the procedure shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A request for a standard review shall be submitted in writing to the chairman of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 30 days of the receipt of the request, the board must notify, in writing, the person making the request of the commencement of the 120-day standard review process or that the proposed project is not in accordance with RSA 151-C:5, II, and no standard review shall take place.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The review of an existing standard shall take no longer than 120 days.  Adoption of the standard shall be in accordance with RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board shall notify persons, pursuant to RSA 151-C:5, I, of the beginning of the standard review period and the schedule for the review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If the board does not provide a standard allocating the new service or a statement on competition within the allotted 180 days, the proposed service shall not be required to obtain a certificate of need and shall not be subject to regulation under RSA 151-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the case of a service for which there is no standard, any person may request, in writing, that the board develop a standard.  Notwithstanding RSA 541-A:4, the procedure shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A request for a standard development shall be submitted in writing to the chairman of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 30 days of the receipt of the request, the board shall notify, in writing, the person making the request of the commencement of the 120-day standard development process or that the service is not in accordance with RSA 151-C:5, II, and no standard development shall take place.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The development of a new standard shall take no longer than 120 days.  Adoption of the standard shall be in accordance with RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board shall notify persons, pursuant to RSA 151-C:5, I, of the beginning of the standard development period and the schedule for the review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The standard shall be either a standard allocating the new service by number, type, and location or a statement that the proposed new service is in the best competitive interest of health care in the state and shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 151-C:8.  The decision of the board shall be considered a final decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the board does not provide a standard allocating the new service or a statement on competition within the allotted 180 days, the proposed service shall not be required to obtain a certificate of need and shall not be subject to regulation under RSA 151-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In any standards for nursing facilities, the board shall provide that priority for a certificate of need for additional nursing facility beds shall be given to any facility which after January 1, 1999, has surrendered its certificate of need for the same or greater number of nursing facility beds.  A facility may transfer to any other entity its priority status for a new certificate of need.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any nursing home may surrender its license for any nursing home beds and redesignate those beds as mid-level care beds, without being subject to any requirements pursuant to this chapter.  Such redesignation shall take effect upon notice to the commissioner.  Any such beds so redesignated may be converted back to nursing home beds without being subject to any requirements pursuant to this chapter.  Such conversion shall take effect upon notice to the commissioner.  Any moratorium on the creation of new nursing home beds shall not apply with respect to beds which are converted back to nursing home beds pursuant to this paragraph.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-C:8 Procedures for Certificate of Need. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a standard developed through RSA 151-C:5 or 151-C:6 indicates a need for additional health services, the board shall issue a request for applications.  The board shall publish, in other than the legal notices section, in a newspaper of statewide distribution and in at least one newspaper in every county, as well as notify all affected persons as defined in paragraph VI(b) of this section, a notice that the board is requesting applications for certificates of need for the specified service.  At a minimum the notice shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A brief description of the service to be provided, including the amount, type, and location as established by the standard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The final date that applications are to be submitted which shall be no sooner than 60 days from the date of publication.  An application in response to a request for application may be submitted prior to the deadline, but no review shall commence prior to the deadline.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An address at which applicants may obtain copies of the application format as well as the minimum criteria and specifications which shall be the basis for judging the merits of each application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall be available to provide technical assistance to any applicant submitting an application in response to a request for applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All applications received in response to a single request for applications shall be reviewed simultaneously and shall be considered in relationship to each other.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every application shall contain such information as the board adopts by rule.  The board shall not require any information which it has not adopted by rule.  The information requirements established by the board may vary according to the purpose of the review or the type of health service being reviewed.  In addition to the information required for submission to the board, any applicant may submit, and the board shall duly consider, any other information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The board shall examine every application for form and completeness, and the information required by RSA 151-C:7 as well as the specifications and standards outlined in the request for application.  If an application is determined incomplete by the board, it shall notify the applicant by certified mail within 15 business days of receipt of the application.  Such notification shall include a full explanation of the reasons for incompleteness.  If no request for additional information is made by the board within the 15 business days, the application shall be considered complete.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An applicant whose application is incomplete shall be allowed a maximum of 15 business days, from the date of receipt of notification of incompleteness, to provide the required additional information.  The applicant shall not provide more than the required additional information.  The board shall then review the additional information provided by the applicant;  and, if satisfactory, the application shall be considered complete and the applicant shall be notified by certified mail.  If the application is still found to be incomplete, the board shall mail the applicant a notification within 10 business days of receipt of the additional information.  If no such notification is mailed to the applicant by the board within the 10 business days' period, the application shall be considered complete.  Within 5 business days of the receipt of any information submitted pursuant to the second completeness notice, the board shall notify the applicant as to whether such information is satisfactory and the application shall be considered complete.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any applicant whose application is incomplete following the second completeness review under subparagraph (b) may, by certified mail, within 5 business days of receipt of the second notice of incompleteness:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Provide the additional required information;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Stipulate that it wishes to have its application reviewed by the board notwithstanding its incompleteness.  Any applicant whose application is incomplete and who fails to either provide the additional required information or stipulate that it wishes to have its application reviewed notwithstanding its incompleteness shall waive any right to have its application reviewed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The state agency shall review any application for which a stipulation has been filed pursuant to subparagraph (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An applicant may withdraw an application at any time thereby terminating the review process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Within 10 business days of completion of the completeness review under paragraph V of this section, the board shall mail, to any qualified applicant, a notice that formal review of the application has begun and shall publish the notice in other than the legal notice section of one or more newspapers of general circulation in the state and in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the service area of the facility to be reviewed.  The board shall provide all affected persons, as defined in subparagraph (b), with written notification of the beginning of a review.  The notice shall include a statement that review has begun and the proposed schedule for review by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of this paragraph, "affected persons'' include organizations of health care providers and organizations of health care consumers, as defined by the board by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A, and members of the public who are to be served by the proposed project.  For purposes of this paragraph, notification of all qualified applicants in which the proposed project is to be offered or developed shall be by certified mail.  Notification to all affected persons shall be by mail and notification to members of the public shall be by newspaper.  Notification by newspaper shall serve as appropriate notice to all health care facilities located within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If an affected person fails to receive notification which was provided in accordance with this paragraph, such failure of notice shall not be grounds for reversal of a decision made by the board, defeat any jurisdiction of the board, or adversely affect the regularity of any proceedings before the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The date on which notification is sent to qualified applicants or the date on which notification to the members of the public first appears in a newspaper published in the state, whichever occurs later, shall be the date of notification and shall be the beginning date of the review cycle of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board shall establish review schedules which provide that no review by the board shall, to the extent possible, take longer than 90 calendar days from the beginning of the review cycle to the date of a final decision of the board.  In accordance with the requirements of RSA 151-C:11, the board shall adopt exception criteria for determining when it would not be practicable to complete a review within 90 calendar days.  If an application clearly meets such exception criteria, the agency may provide for a single extension of the review period for a total of 30 calendar days beyond the initial 90-day period.  The total review period for certificate of need shall not extend beyond 120 days from the beginning of review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Upon request, the board shall provide for access by the general public to all applications reviewed by the board and to all other written materials pertinent to board review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The board shall provide in its review procedures for a public hearing.  The board shall, prior to such hearing, provide notice of such hearing in accordance with the notification provisions in paragraph VI of this section.  The procedures for a public hearing shall include an opportunity for any person to present testimony regarding the proposed project, the right of any persons testifying to be accompanied and advised by legal counsel, the right of any qualified applicant to cross-examine witnesses, and the establishment of a formal record of the hearing.  The board shall not impose any fee for such a public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. During the course of review of any application for a certificate of need, the board shall take reasonable measures to prohibit and prevent all ex parte communication relating to the merits of such application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. (a) After an application has been filed with the board, the applicant may file a request to amend the application only during the 45 days after the date of notification of the beginning of review.  If the board grants the applicant's request, the application shall be filed 30 days after the board's approval.  The board shall examine the amended application for form and completeness, for information required in RSA 151-C:7, and for conformity to all applicable standards in the request for applications.  If an application is determined incomplete, the board shall notify the applicant by certified mail within 10 business days of receipt of the amended application.  The applicant whose application is incomplete shall be allowed a maximum of 10 business days from the date of receipt of the board's notification of incompleteness to provide the required additional information.  The amended application shall then be considered complete and processed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph VIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When an application is filed with the board, an applicant shall be required by the board to file an amendment of the application when any supporting documentation or other material submitted to the board by the applicant indicates that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The nature, scope, or location of the project will differ substantially from those described in the application;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The method of financing will differ substantially from that described in the application in that the estimated capital expenditure will exceed that proposed in the application by 15 percent plus the inflation factor, as specified in RSA 151-C:12, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The identity of the applicant has changed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The board may waive the requirements of subparagraph (b)(1), (2) or (3) if it is determined that the proposed amendment of the application is technical or otherwise insignificant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If an amendment is filed in accordance with subparagraph (a) or (b), the application shall return to the point in the review process defined in paragraph VI relative to the notification to the applicant that review of the application has begun.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Any action by the board or by an applicant pursuant to this section which results in a delay of the review process shall affect all applicants which filed under the same request for application and are considered by the board to be competing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-C:9 Decision Regarding Certificate of Need;  Issuance of Certificate of Need;  Reconsideration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon completion of the review, the board, by majority vote of eligible board members, shall render a decision on the applicant or applicants which filed in response to a request for application.  Any board member who has a personal or business conflict with any application shall not vote on such application.  The decision shall be in the form of an approval, denial, or an approval with conditions.  An approval of a certificate of need shall be in conformance with the standard used as the basis for the request for application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall consider competing applicants in relationship to each other.  The decision shall be based on the applicant who demonstrates superiority in cost effectiveness, quality, and affordability and who will best meet the specifications and criteria outlined in the standard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the board fails to issue a final decision within the time period specified for the review, a certificate of need shall be denied.  The applicant may either request a reconsideration hearing under paragraph IV, or, within a reasonable time following the expiration of that period, petition the supreme court to require the board to render a final decision on the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Any person, for good cause shown, may request in writing a public hearing for purposes of reconsideration of a final decision of the board.  The board shall adopt appropriate procedures for such a hearing.  No fee may be imposed for the hearing.  For purposes of this paragraph, a request for a reconsideration hearing, other than by an applicant denied a certificate of need, shall be good cause if it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Presents significant, relevant information not previously considered by the board;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Demonstrates that there have been significant changes in factors or circumstances relied upon by the board in reaching its decision;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Demonstrates that the board has materially failed to follow its adopted procedures in reaching its decision;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Provides such other basis for a public hearing as the board determines constitutes good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To be effective, a request for a reconsideration hearing shall be received by the board within 20 business days following the date of the board's decision.  If granted, the hearing shall commence within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request.  The applicant may waive the 30-day requirement.  At least 14 calendar days prior to the reconsideration hearing, notification of the hearing shall be sent to the person requesting the hearing and to the persons proposing the new institutional health service and to others upon request.  Within 25 business days after the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall make written findings which state the basis for its decision.  The decision shall be considered the final decision of the board.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-C:12 Validity of Certificates of Need;  Compliance;  Sanctions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A certificate of need issued pursuant to this chapter shall expire upon failure to commence or complete the project authorized thereby within the time period specified in this section.  The board's approval shall be terminated upon the expiration of such period, and the person proposing to offer or develop the new institutional health service shall be required to resubmit an application for certificate of need under RSA 151-C:8.  In the event that only part of a project to offer or develop the new institutional health service has been commenced or completed within such period, the board's approval shall be terminated upon the expiration of such period solely with respect to the parts of the project which have not been commenced or completed.  Project completion date requirements are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Projects which solely involve the acquisition and installation of equipment must be completed within 2 years from the date of issuance of a certificate of need or certificate of exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of construction projects, the following time periods apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the total estimated cost of the project is less than $ 1,000,000, the project must be commenced within one year of, and completed within 3 years of, the date of issuance of a certificate of need.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the total estimated cost of the project is greater than $1,000,000, then the project must be commenced within 18 months of, and completed within 5 years of, the date of issuance of a certificate of need.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the case of any plan for capital expenditures proposed by or on behalf of a health care facility, health maintenance organization, or health care provider under which a series of obligations for capital expenditures for discrete components of the plan is to be incurred over a period longer than one year, the board may allow up to 3 years following the date of approval for incurring such capital expenditures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Pursuant to a showing of good cause by the person proposing the project, the board shall extend by 6 months the period for commencement.  A maximum of 2 such extensions shall be allowed.  Upon a showing of substantial, diligent progress and good cause by the person proposing the project, the board shall grant up to a maximum of 2 extensions of 6 months each for completion of the project.  For purposes of this paragraph, "good cause'' includes delay resulting from unpreventable or unexpected occurrences, such as emergency, strike, disaster, unforeseen shortage of materials or other reasonably unforeseeable event.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purposes of this chapter, a project shall be commenced if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The applicant has submitted to the board a certified copy of a written agreement executed between the applicant and a registered general contractor to construct and complete the project within a designated time schedule in accordance with final architectural plans and specifications;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The applicant has submitted evidence to the board that there has been construction work on the project to justify and require a progress payment by the applicant to the general contractor under the terms of the construction agreement, or, if the construction agreement does not require progress payments, then construction has progressed to the state at which an initial progress payment would otherwise be required in accordance with the usual and customary practices of the building industry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For purposes of this chapter, completion shall mean when the approved proposed project is sufficiently complete so that it becomes operational for the purpose for which the certificate of need was issued.  A certificate of need shall be valid only for the designated scope of the project and for the premises and geographical area named in the application.  A certificate of need granted for a project shall not be considered as an approval of that portion of the total actual cost of such a project which is in excess of the sum of:  (a) the anticipated cost designated in the application;  (b) an additional 15 percent of the total cost;  and (c) cost increases clearly attributable to inflation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. (a) Prior to completion of the proposed project, the board may require any applicant to file a change of scope when any documentation or other material submitted to the board indicates that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The nature, scope, or location of the project will differ substantially in the opinion of the board from those described in the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The method of financing will differ substantially because the estimated capital expenditure will exceed that proposed in the application by 15 percent plus the inflation factor, as specified in RSA 151-C:12, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The identity of the applicant has changed.
