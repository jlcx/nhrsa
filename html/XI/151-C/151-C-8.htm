(a) The board shall examine every application for form and completeness, and the information required by RSA 151-C:7 as well as the specifications and standards outlined in the request for application.  If an application is determined incomplete by the board, it shall notify the applicant by certified mail within 15 business days of receipt of the application.

Notification by newspaper shall serve as appropriate notice to all health care facilities located within the state.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) If an affected person fails to receive notification which was provided in accordance with this paragraph, such failure of notice shall not be grounds for reversal of a decision made by the board, defeat any jurisdiction of the board, or adversely affect the regularity of any proceedings before the board.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. The date on which notification is sent to qualified applicants or the date on which notification to the members of the public first appears in a newspaper published in the state, whichever occurs later, shall be the date of notification and shall be the beginning date of the review cycle of the board.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII.
