&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon completion of the review, the board, by majority vote of eligible board members, shall render a decision on the applicant or applicants which filed in response to a request for application.

An approval of a certificate of need shall be in conformance with the standard used as the basis for the request for application.  The board shall not deny any application which satisfies the applicable standard developed under RSA 151-C:5 solely because the new institutional health service proposed by the applicant is likely to cause economic harm to an existing provider of health care services other than a hospital which qualifies as a critical access hospital under federal law.  The board may deny an application based on finding a new institutional health service is likely to have a material adverse impact on quality of care or access to services.

The board shall adopt appropriate procedures for such a hearing.  No fee may be imposed for the hearing.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Demonstrates that the board has materially failed to follow its adopted procedures in reaching its decision;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Provides such other basis for a public hearing as the board determines constitutes good cause.
