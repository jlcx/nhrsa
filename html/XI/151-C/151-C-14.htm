<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person who violates this chapter shall be fined not more than  1/2 of one percent of the total operating budget of the previous year, or, in the case of a new facility, not more than  1/2 of one percent of the projected annual operating budget for the first year of operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In addition to all other sanctions, if any person offers or develops any new institutional health service without first having been issued a certificate of need, or violates any other provision of this chapter or any lawful rule adopted under this chapter, upon the posting of a bond or security, the board or health care facilities, health maintenance organizations, and health care providers located in the state shall have standing to maintain a civil action in the superior court of the county in which such alleged violation has occurred, or in which such person may be found, to enjoin, restrain, or prevent such violation.  Upon written request by the board, it shall be the duty of the attorney general of the state to furnish such legal services as may be appropriate and to prosecute such action for injunctive relief to an appropriate conclusion.
