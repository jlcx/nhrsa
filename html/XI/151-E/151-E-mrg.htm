&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-E:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this chapter is to provide medicaid eligible elderly and chronically ill adults with a continuum of care appropriate to their needs and affordable to the state and its taxpayers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To a great extent, the current system relies on nursing facilities to provide care for this group.  While the quality of this care is high, an increasingly elderly and disabled population and a constrained public financial resource base require the state to reevaluate how long-term care services are provided.  Moreover, many long-term care recipients and potential recipients prefer to be cared for at home or in other settings less acute than a nursing facility.  Because far more may be spent on nursing facility care than on home and community-based care, there is an inherent difference between the state's present long-term care system and what recipients prefer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This chapter is an essential step toward rebalancing the long-term care system and expanding choices available to recipients.  It increases the continuum of care by adding mid-level care, including but not limited to, assisted living and residential care services.  Through an acuity-based reimbursement system , a comprehensive needs assessment process, and an information and assistance process, it provides those eligible for Medicaid nursing facility services the opportunity to choose more appropriate, less costly mid-level services and home and community-based care.  In this way, the state intends to serve this increasing Medicaid eligible population more appropriately and more economically.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall designate in its operating budget requests specific class lines for nursing facility, mid-level, and home-based care provided for in this chapter.  These class lines shall reflect, and the requesting documentation shall include, the anticipated number of persons to receive services.  The department shall not increase expenditures in approved budgets for these class lines or the number of persons to receive mid-level or home care services without the approval of the legislative fiscal committee, and the prior review of the county-state finance commission.  The medicaid rates paid for nursing facility services, mid-level care services, and home and community-based care services shall not be reduced below those levels in effect on the last day of the previous biennium.

The prior approval shall include a comparison of the mid-level or home-based care costs of the person with the costs of a facility qualified to provide any specialized services necessary for the proper care and treatment of the individual.  The department shall provide a report semi-annually on the utilization of non-nursing home services to the county-state finance commission and the legislative fiscal committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The methodology for determining the cost of care for recipients in the home and community-based care waiver program for the elderly and chronically ill shall include the cost of:
<br>

(4) The requirement that nursing facility care include both the initial Medicaid rate and supplemental rates paid through the Medicaid Quality Incentive Program;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The requirement that the nursing facility will include the cost for transitional case management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A process to identify persons in home-based or mid-level care whose costs are expected to exceed 80 percent of the average annual cost for the provision of services to a person in a nursing facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A standard of review and process for prior approval by the commissioner, in accordance with paragraph II of this section, for the cases identified through the process in subparagraph (b).

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, moneys from the ICF quality assessment under RSA 84-D:3 and any federal financial participation received by the state as a result of expenditures funded by these ICF quality assessments, and the interest thereon shall be paid out no less frequently than on a quarterly basis and shall be disbursed as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The moneys shall be used to eliminate or reduce to the maximum extent possible the difference between the allowable medicaid costs, derived from the ICF medicaid rate setting system, which ICFs incur in providing care to medicaid residents, and the amount which the state has budgeted in order to fund that care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If after the disbursement required in paragraph I there are still any moneys remaining from the ICF quality assessment and any federal financial participation and the interest thereon, the ICF rate setting system shall be adjusted to insure that all moneys are expended for ICF care.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-E:18 Presumptive Eligibility. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner of the department shall establish a presumptive eligibility program to prevent unnecessary and costly institutionalization of individuals who are Medicaid eligible for nursing facility services and choose to receive services in less restrictive settings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Pending verification of application information, the department shall authorize medical assistance in the interval between application and the final Medicaid eligibility determination if the department determines the applicant is likely to be eligible.  Presumptive eligibility shall be made available at department district offices, information and referral resource centers, and other qualified providers.  The presumptive eligibility period shall not include coverage of home or environmental modifications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Presumptive eligibility authorizations shall be dependent upon a face-to-face clinical assessment of each applicant and review of a completed Medicaid application.  The department shall perform the face-to-face clinical assessment within 20 business days of a request for medical assistance.  The department shall review the application for presumptive eligibility within 5 business days of completion of the Medicaid application and clinical assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The presumptive eligibility period begins on the date the department determines the applicant likely meets the eligibility criteria and ends on the date eligibility is verified or the individual is determined ineligible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The Medicaid applicant shall acknowledge in writing the uncertainty of continuing service coverage beyond the presumptive eligibility period and the potential for financial responsibility for costs incurred in the event of a determination of Medicaid ineligibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If an applicant is determined ineligible for Medicaid, the department shall promptly notify the applicant and the applicant's providers of the finding and the immediate termination of service coverage authorization.  In such a case, the department shall use non-Medicaid funds to pay for any waiver services which the applicant has already received.  In the event an application was filed with fraudulent intent, the department shall be entitled to reimbursement of funds expended on behalf of the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner of the department shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A process to determine presumptive eligibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A definition of a qualified provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Content and format of forms required under this section.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Asset transfer disqualification'' means a transfer of assets for less than fair market value by a Medicaid applicant or recipient as set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1396p(c)(1)(A) and 42 U.S.C. 1396p(c)(1)(B).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Department'' means the department of health and human services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Fiduciary'' means a person to whom power or property has been formally entrusted for the benefit of another such as an attorney-in-fact, legal guardian, trustee, or representative payee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b), when an asset transfer made on or after the effective date of this section results in a final determination of a Medicaid asset transfer disqualification, the person who received the assets from a resident which resulted in the Medicaid asset transfer disqualification shall be liable under this section to the long-term care facility for all costs of care up to the amount transferred to the person.  The person shall be liable at the facility's Medicaid rate for services for the period of asset transfer disqualification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) It shall be an affirmative defense in any action instituted under subparagraph (a), that the transfer of the asset which resulted in a final determination of a Medicaid asset transfer disqualification was not a disqualifying transfer under 42 U.S.C. 1396p.

Upon a finding of negligence, the fiduciary shall be liable to the facility for the costs of care at the facility's Medicaid rate for services for the period of resulting noncoverage.  At least 30 days before filing an action pursuant to this paragraph, the facility shall send a written notice of its intent to file the action to any person whom it intends to name as a defendant in the action.  In any claim of negligence against a legal guardian, notice of intent to file the action shall simultaneously be provided to the probate court having jurisdiction over the guardianship.  The probate court shall have jurisdiction over any action alleging negligence of a legal guardian, and shall, in any such action, consider whether removal of the guardian is in the ward's best interests in accordance with RSA 464-A:39, I(c) and shall have the authority to assess liability and award damages under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 10 days of admission of the resident to the facility, such facility shall provide written notice to the resident, and to any fiduciary of the resident whose identity and mailing address are disclosed to the facility at the time of admission.  The notice shall be deemed to have been completed when delivered in hand or when placed in first class United States mail to the disclosed mailing address.  The notice shall contain the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A summary of the fiduciary's potential responsibility to apply for Medicaid under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An explicit reference to this section of the statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Address and telephone number of the local Medicaid office.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Name, address, and telephone number of any contact person at the facility who is responsible for assisting the resident in applying for Medicaid, if the facility has such a contact person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any action under this paragraph shall be subject to the following affirmative defenses:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The facility failed to provide notice to the fiduciary as described in subparagraph (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The fiduciary was unable to fulfill his or her duties under this paragraph due to infirmity of body or mind.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any fiduciary or person who has received authority over the income of a resident such as a person who has been given or otherwise obtained authority over a resident's bank account, has been named as or has rights as a joint account holder, or otherwise has obtained or received any control over a resident's bank account or any other income of a resident, shall be liable under this section to the long-term care facility to the extent that any such person or fiduciary refuses to pay the patient liability amount due under Medicaid, provided that the person or fiduciary is in receipt of written notice from the department of the patient liability amount at the time such income is received by the fiduciary or person, and provided further that the liability of the person or fiduciary shall be for amounts going forward from the receipt of the notice.  At least 30 days before filing an action pursuant to this paragraph, the facility shall send a written notice of its intent to file the action to any person or fiduciary whom it intends to name as a defendant in the action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No judgment obtained in any proceeding under this chapter shall be acted upon through execution, levy, or otherwise during the pendency of any actually completed and filed application for Medicaid.  Attachments and trustee process to secure any judgment or potential judgment shall be permitted subject to the discretion of the court to protect facilities from non-payment or from the failure of the resident, or that resident's fiduciary, to cooperate in obtaining Medicaid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or otherwise diminish any other causes of action possessed by any such long-term care facility.  The death of the resident shall not nullify or otherwise affect the liability of the person or persons charged with the cost of care rendered or the patient liability amount as referenced in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A fiduciary under this section shall not be personally liable for the acts or omissions of the fiduciary's predecessor, if any, solely by reason of his or her role as successor fiduciary.
