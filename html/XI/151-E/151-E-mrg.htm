&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-E:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this chapter is to provide medicaid eligible elderly and chronically ill adults with a continuum of care appropriate to their needs and affordable to the state and its taxpayers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To a great extent, the current system relies on nursing facilities to provide care for this group.  While the quality of this care is high, an increasingly elderly and disabled population and a constrained public financial resource base require the state to reevaluate how long-term care services are provided.  Moreover, many long-term care recipients and potential recipients prefer to be cared for at home or in other settings less acute than a nursing facility.  Because far more may be spent on nursing facility care than on home and community-based care, there is an inherent difference between the state's present long-term care system and what recipients prefer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This chapter is an essential step toward rebalancing the long-term care system and expanding choices available to recipients.  It increases the continuum of care by adding mid-level care, including but not limited to, assisted living and residential care services.  Through an acuity-based reimbursement system , a comprehensive needs assessment process, and an information and assistance process, it provides those eligible for Medicaid nursing facility services the opportunity to choose more appropriate, less costly mid-level services and home and community-based care.  In this way, the state intends to serve this increasing Medicaid eligible population more appropriately and more economically.

If a nursing facility admits a person who at the time of admission was not determined to be clinically eligible for the level of services provided by a nursing facility and that person, within a 3-year period after admission, is determined to be financially eligible for medicaid benefits pursuant to RSA 151-E:3, I(b), the nursing facility shall be responsible for all costs of medicaid-funded long-term care services provided to the individual for the period of time, not to exceed one year, from the date of the determination of financial eligibility to the end of the third year of admission unless the individual is determined to be clinically eligible for nursing facility services.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall designate in its operating budget requests specific class lines for nursing facility, mid-level, and home-based care provided for in this chapter.  These class lines shall reflect, and the requesting documentation shall include, the anticipated number of persons to receive services.  The department shall not increase expenditures in approved budgets for these class lines or the number of persons to receive mid-level or home care services without the approval of the legislative fiscal committee, and the prior review of the county-state finance commission.  The medicaid rates paid for nursing facility services, mid-level care services, and home and community-based care services shall not be reduced below those levels in effect on the last day of the previous biennium.

II. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2003, and each fiscal year thereafter the average annual cost for the provision of services to persons in the mid-level of care shall not exceed 60 percent of the average annual cost for the provision of services in a nursing facility.  The average annual cost for the provision of services in home-based care shall not exceed 50 percent of the average annual cost for the provision of services to persons in a nursing facility.  No person whose costs would be in excess of 80 percent of the average annual cost for the provision of services to a person in a nursing facility shall be approved for home-based or mid-level services without the prior approval of the commissioner of health and human services.  The prior approval shall include a comparison of the mid-level or home-based care costs of the person with the costs of a facility qualified to provide any specialized services necessary for the proper care and treatment of the individual.  The department shall provide a report semi-annually on the utilization of non-nursing home services to the county-state finance commission and the legislative fiscal committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The methodology for determining the cost of care for recipients in the home and community-based care waiver program for the elderly and chronically ill shall include the cost of:

(b) Such methodology shall not include services rendered for the treatment of an acute illness or injury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Pursuant to RSA 541-A, the commissioner of the department of health and human services, with prior reporting to the oversight committee on health and human services, shall adopt by rule:

(1) Bases for the methodologies;
<br>

(3) Average annual costs based on the annual average number of recipients in the setting;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The requirement that nursing facility care include both the initial Medicaid rate and supplemental rates paid through the Medicaid Quality Incentive Program;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The requirement that the nursing facility will include the cost for transitional case management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A process to identify persons in home-based or mid-level care whose costs are expected to exceed 80 percent of the average annual cost for the provision of services to a person in a nursing facility.
<br>

<codesect>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The department estimate shall be based on provider reimbursement rates that ensure a provider workforce that is sufficient to fully meet the needs of eligible consumers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-E:18 Presumptive Eligibility. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner of the department shall establish a presumptive eligibility program to prevent unnecessary and costly institutionalization of individuals who are Medicaid eligible for nursing facility services and choose to receive services in less restrictive settings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Pending verification of application information, the department shall authorize medical assistance in the interval between application and the final Medicaid eligibility determination if the department determines the applicant is likely to be eligible.  Presumptive eligibility shall be made available at department district offices, information and referral resource centers, and other qualified providers.  The presumptive eligibility period shall not include coverage of home or environmental modifications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Presumptive eligibility authorizations shall be dependent upon a face-to-face clinical assessment of each applicant and review of a completed Medicaid application.  The department shall perform the face-to-face clinical assessment within 20 business days of a request for medical assistance.  The department shall review the application for presumptive eligibility within 5 business days of completion of the Medicaid application and clinical assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The presumptive eligibility period begins on the date the department determines the applicant likely meets the eligibility criteria and ends on the date eligibility is verified or the individual is determined ineligible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The Medicaid applicant shall acknowledge in writing the uncertainty of continuing service coverage beyond the presumptive eligibility period and the potential for financial responsibility for costs incurred in the event of a determination of Medicaid ineligibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If an applicant is determined ineligible for Medicaid, the department shall promptly notify the applicant and the applicant's providers of the finding and the immediate termination of service coverage authorization.  In such a case, the department shall use non-Medicaid funds to pay for any waiver services which the applicant has already received.  In the event an application was filed with fraudulent intent, the department shall be entitled to reimbursement of funds expended on behalf of the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner of the department shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A process to determine presumptive eligibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A definition of a qualified provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Content and format of forms required under this section.
