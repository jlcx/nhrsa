II. To a great extent, the current system relies on nursing facilities to provide care for this group.  While the quality of this care is high, an increasingly elderly and disabled population and a constrained public financial resource base require the state to reevaluate how long-term care services are provided.  Moreover, many long-term care recipients and potential recipients prefer to be cared for at home or in other settings less acute than a nursing facility.  Because far more may be spent on nursing facility care than on home and community-based care, there is an inherent difference between the state's present long-term care system and what recipients prefer.
