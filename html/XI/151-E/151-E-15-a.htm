&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151-E:15-a Expenditure of Funds From ICF Quality Assessment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, moneys from the ICF quality assessment under RSA 84-D:3 and any federal financial participation received by the state as a result of expenditures funded by these ICF quality assessments, and the interest thereon shall be paid out no less frequently than on a quarterly basis and shall be disbursed as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The moneys shall be used to eliminate or reduce to the maximum extent possible the difference between the allowable medicaid costs, derived from the ICF medicaid rate setting system, which ICFs incur in providing care to medicaid residents, and the amount which the state has budgeted in order to fund that care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If after the disbursement required in paragraph I there are still any moneys remaining from the ICF quality assessment and any federal financial participation and the interest thereon, the ICF rate setting system shall be adjusted to insure that all moneys are expended for ICF care.
