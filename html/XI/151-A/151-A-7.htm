Under emergency conditions the secretary of the board in the secretary's discretion subject to the confirmation of the board may issue a non-renewable temporary emergency permit to a person of good character and suitability to act in the capacity of an administrator under the supervision of a licensed administrator pending action by the board until the next examination or not to exceed 6 months.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. If the board is satisfied that a candidate for licensure under the reciprocity provisions of RSA 151-A:9 meets all the requirements and needs only sit for the state examination, the board may, if an urgent need is demonstrated, provide the candidate with a temporary permit to work as an administrator in a nursing home within the state of New Hampshire.  This temporary permit shall only be valid for a period of 6 months and shall not be renewable or reissued to the same candidate.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any license issued by the board under or pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be under the hand and seal of the secretary of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The department of health and human services may approve programs conducted within and without this state as sufficient to meet education and training requirements established pursuant to this chapter.
