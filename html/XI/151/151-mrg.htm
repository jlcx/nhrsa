&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Records'' means records of interviews, internal reviews and investigations, and all reports, statements, minutes, memoranda, charts, statistics, and other documentation generated during the activities of a quality assurance program.  "Records'' shall not mean original medical records or other records kept relative to any resident in the course of the business of operating a licensed residential care facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Quality assurance program'' means a comprehensive, ongoing, organization-wide system of mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the quality and appropriateness of the care provided, so that important problems and trends in the delivery of care are identified and that steps are taken to correct problems and to take advantage of opportunities to improve care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Records of a quality assurance program in a licensed residential care facility, including those of its functional components and committees as defined by the facility's quality assurance plans, organized to evaluate matters relating to the care and treatment of residents and to improve the quality of care provided, and testimony by owners or members, or both, on the board of directors of the residential care facility, medical and clinical staff, employees, or the committee attendees relating to activities of the quality assurance program, shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.  However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources shall not be construed as immune from discovery or use in any such civil or administrative action merely because they were presented to a quality assurance program, and any person who supplies information or testifies as part of a quality assurance program, or who is a member of a quality assurance program committee, shall not be prevented from testifying as to matters within his or her knowledge, but such witness shall not be asked about his or her testimony before such program, or opinions formed by him or her, as a result of committee participation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of health and human services shall make at least one annual unannounced clinical inspection of every facility licensed under this chapter, except home health care agencies and home care service provider agencies, which shall be inspected no less frequently than once every 24 months.  The purpose of the inspection shall be to determine that the facility is in compliance with all provisions of this chapter and applicable clinical rules adopted under this chapter.  For residential care facilities, the inspection shall include a review of the programs and services offered in the facility to assure that the facility is in compliance with its current level of licensure, and a survey of the most recent individual resident needs determinations where such surveys are not done under the survey and certification process for Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, as amended, to assure that the facility and its programs and services are appropriate to the needs of the residents.  The department shall also conduct compliance monitoring visits as necessary to ensure that corrective action required to correct cited violations of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter have been appropriately implemented.  Inspection results shall be provided as a written report that identifies any noncompliance with this chapter and applicable clinical rules adopted under this chapter.  The results of this inspection and any later inspection shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the facility in the manner determined by the commissioner of the department of health and human services.  The results so posted shall indicate the facilities and services inspected and the results for each such facility or service.  This section shall not apply to facilities or entities that have deemed status under RSA 151:5-b.  If a residential care facility, as referenced under RSA 151:9, VII(a)(1) or (2) or an adult day care program as referenced under RSA 151:2, I(f) has been inspected and is found to be deficiency-free for 2 consecutive years it shall be granted a one-year waiver from the provisions of this section and thereafter shall be inspected every other year;  provided, that the facility remains deficiency-free when it is inspected, that the facility is not the subject of a founded complaint investigation under RSA 151:6, and the facility remains under the same administrator who is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) In addition to paragraph I of this section, if the state fire marshal authorizes the department to conduct life safety code inspections, the department shall make at least one annual, unannounced inspection of all facilities licensed under this chapter pursuant to that authorization.  If in the course of such inspection the inspector finds that there are violations of the life safety code which the inspector believes must be corrected, the inspector shall provide the facility with a notice to correct.  This notice shall identify the specific provisions of the life safety code that the inspector believes have been violated, and contain instructions with respect to corrective action to be taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the facility disagrees with the notice to correct, the facility may request a review and determination by the state fire marshal, or may request a variance or exception from the state fire marshal.  The notice to correct shall be stayed pending the fire marshal's decision.  If the state fire marshal determines, following review, that the notice to correct or portions thereof should not have been issued, the department shall withdraw or amend the notice to correct in accordance with the fire marshal's determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Facilities shall not be required to post notices to correct issued under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Residential care, requiring a minimum of regulation and reflecting the availability of assistance in personal and social activities with a minimum of supervision or health care, which can be provided in a home or home-like setting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Supported residential health care, reflecting the availability of social or health services, as needed, from appropriately trained or licensed individuals, who need not be employees of the facility, but shall not require nursing services complex enough to require 24-hour nursing supervision.  Such facilities may also include short-term medical care for residents of the facility who may be convalescing from an illness and these residents shall be capable of self-evacuation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Nursing facilities providing a range of social and health services, including 24-hour-a-day supervision and the provision of medical care and treatment, according to a plan of care, by appropriately trained or licensed individuals who are employees of or who are under contract to the facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Special needs residential facilities, other than specialty hospitals, which, in addition to meeting the criteria of subparagraph (1), (2), or (3), reflect the availability of specialized supervision and treatment appropriate to the needs of the residents being cared for by appropriately trained or licensed individuals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Additional levels of classification may be established within each major level, and a facility may hold more than one license.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services may, in adopting rules under RSA 151:9, I, establish limits on the number of residents to be cared for at different licensure levels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall establish a program, by rule, to certify facilities that provide services to fewer than 3 individuals, beyond room and board care, in a residential setting, as an alternative to nursing facility care, which offers residents a home-like living arrangement, social, health, or medical services, including, but not limited to, medical or nursing supervision, medical care or treatment by appropriately trained or licensed individuals, assistance in daily living, or protective care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Rules shall strike an appropriate balance between the protection afforded and the cost to implement, considering the cost to both the state and the provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any rule that fails to meet the criteria established in subparagraphs (a)(1)-(3) shall be considered to exceed the statutory authority of the agency, be contrary to legislative intent, and be contrary to public interest, and shall be null and void.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

You also may register a complaint with the state and federal home health care regulatory agencies.  If you have a legal representative that person may act on your behalf.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) A home health care provider may discharge a client if the client's needs can no longer be met by the home health care provider, if one or more of the following applies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Has led to or will lead to an immediate deterioration in the client's condition, such that home health care will no longer be safe or appropriate;  or

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The home health care provider shall make reasonable attempts, prior to discharge, to resolve the circumstances that may lead to a discharge under this paragraph.  When a home health care provider determines that a client will require continuing care after services are discontinued pursuant to this paragraph, the home health care provider shall arrange for or assist the client to arrange for such services, to the extent practicable, and shall provide sufficient clinical information to the receiving entity to assure continuity of care and services.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An emergency discharge is mandated by the client's health care needs and is in accordance with written orders of the client's ordering physician or authorizing health care provider, if any.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The client no longer needs the services provided by the home health care provider, as confirmed by the client's ordering physician, authorizing health care provider, or case manager, as appropriate.
<br>

(4) Conditions in or around the home imminently threaten the safety of the home health care provider personnel or jeopardize the home health care provider's ability to provide care, in accordance with paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The client, the client's government payor, or the client's third-party payor ceases payment or denies authorization for further care and the client is unable or unwilling to pay for continued services or unwilling to apply for other available resources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No discharge shall be permitted if it is contrary to RSA 151:21-b or to the requirements of Titles XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act, as applicable.  The provider shall give notice of the discharge allowed under this paragraph, as soon as practicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The home health care provider has valid reason to believe that its personnel will be subjected to continuing and severe verbal abuse or sexual harassment, as defined in RSA 354-A:7, V, which will jeopardize the home health care provider's ability to secure sufficient personnel resources or to provide care that meets the needs of the client.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A home health care provider that intends to discharge a client shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Prepare a discharge plan designed to ensure a timely and safe discharge in consultation with the client or the client's legal representative, the client's ordering physician or other authorizing health care provider, if any, and any other professional involved in the plan of care, such as a case manager.
