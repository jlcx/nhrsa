I. Any hospital or ambulatory surgical center licensed pursuant to this chapter shall report to the commissioner the occurrence of any of the adverse health care events described in subparagraphs (a)-(f) as soon as is reasonably and practically possible, but no later than 15 working days after discovery of the event.  The report shall be filed in a format specified by the commissioner and shall identify the facility but shall not include any identifying information for any of the health care professionals, facility employees, or patients involved.  The commissioner may consult with experts and organizations familiar with patient safety when developing the format for reporting and in further defining events in order to be consistent with industry standards.

(2) Surgery performed on the wrong patient.
