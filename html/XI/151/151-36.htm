&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 151:36 Payment by Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgical Centers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall assess a fee to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers that are required to report under RSA 151:33 to support the program's approved operating budget.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The hospitals' portion shall be proportional to the number of measures reported by all hospitals in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The ambulatory surgical centers' portion shall be proportional to the total number of measures reported by ambulatory surgical centers in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There shall be proportional fee categories based on the hospital's number of beds, which shall total the amount of payment required by the hospitals.  Of that base amount as stated in subparagraph I(a), each individual hospital shall pay a fee based on the appropriate category for that hospital.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. There shall be proportional fee categories based on the range of procedures performed annually at an ambulatory surgical center, which shall equal the total amount of payment that is required by all ambulatory surgical centers.  Of that base amount as stated in subparagraph I(b), each ambulatory surgical facility required to report shall pay a fee based on the appropriate category for that ambulatory surgical center.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to proportional rates, fee categories, and a payment schedule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. There is hereby established the health care associated infections fund.  The fund shall be composed of fees collected in accordance with RSA 151:36, I-III and shall be used to carry out the provisions of this subdivision.  The fund shall be nonlapsing and shall be continually appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner shall apply for all federal funding available to supplement the health care associated infections program.  In the event federal funding is unavailable to cover the program costs either in part or in its entirety, the hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers shall be responsible for paying their proportion of the fees under this chapter to support the program's operating budget.
