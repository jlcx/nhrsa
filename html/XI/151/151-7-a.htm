I. The department of health and human services may issue a warning, following an investigation conducted under RSA 151:6 or the inspection provided for in RSA 151:6-a, to a facility requiring compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted under it.  The warning shall state a time frame within which the facility shall comply with the directives of the warning, including, for facilities not licensed under this chapter but which are found to require licensure, the final date by which the action or actions requiring licensure must cease or by which an application for licensure must be received by the department of health and human services before the department initiates any legal action available to it to cease the operation of the facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The results of an investigation conducted under RSA 151:6 shall be provided to the licensee, or, for an unlicensed facility, to the owner or person responsible for the facility in the owner's absence.  The results of an investigation of an unlicensed facility shall be provided prior to the issuance of any warning and the owner or person responsible shall be given the opportunity to respond to any findings.  Such response shall be considered by the department of health and human services prior to the issuance of a warning under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An unlicensed facility may appeal a warning.  Appeals shall be conducted in accordance with RSA 151:8.
