&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-F:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to protect workers of the state by requiring advance notification of significant employment losses and by providing a means for workers to seek a remedy through administrative procedure.  The legislature finds that advance notice of a major employment loss event allows all levels of government to prepare to help a sudden large number of affected workers.  The legislature also finds that, while the United States already has a federal WARN Act, the state of New Hampshire should enforce its own program to allow quicker administrative determinations and enforcement.  This purpose is enhanced by allowing the state of New Hampshire to pursue claims on behalf of employees affected by violations of RSA 275-F and asserting liens against the assets of employers who have liability under RSA 275-F.

<center><h3>Section 275-F:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-F:4 Exceptions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In a mass layoff or plant closing, an employer is not required to comply with the notice requirement of RSA 275-F:3 if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The employer is a faltering company and at the time that notice would have been required, the employer was actively seeking capital in the form of loans, or the issuance of stocks, bonds, or other methods of internally generated financing, or additional money, credit, or business through a commercially reasonable method which opportunities were objectively realistic;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The capital or business sought, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the mass layoff or plant closing;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required by RSA 275-F:3 would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The need for notice was not reasonably foreseeable at the time the notice would have been required;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The plant closing is of a temporary facility or the plant closing or mass layoff is the result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the facility, project, or undertaking;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A mass layoff or plant closing is necessitated by a physical calamity, natural disaster, or an act of terrorism or war;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The closing or layoff constitutes a strike or lockout not intended to evade the requirements of this chapter.  Nothing in this chapter shall require an employer to serve written notice when permanently replacing a person who is deemed to be an economic striker under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. section 151 et seq.  Nothing in this chapter shall validate or invalidate any judicial or administrative ruling relating to the hiring of permanent replacements for economic strikers under the National Labor Relations Act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An employer relying on such exceptions shall provide as much notice as is practicable and at that time shall provide a complete statement of the basis for reducing the notification period.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-F:5 Extension of Layoff Period. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A layoff of more than 6 months which, at its outset, was announced to be a layoff of 6 months or less shall be treated as an employment loss under this chapter unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The extension beyond 6 months is caused by business circumstances, including unforeseeable changes in price or cost, not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension beyond 6 months will be required.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-F:6 Determinations With Respect to Employment Loss. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In determining whether a plant closing or mass layoff has occurred or will occur, employment losses for 2 or more groups at a single site of employment, each of which is less than the minimum number of employees specified in RSA 275-F:2, VI or RSA 275-F:2, VIII but which in the aggregate exceed that minimum number, and which occur within any 90-day period shall be considered to be a plant closing or mass layoff unless the employer demonstrates that the employment losses are the result of separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by the employer to evade the requirements of this chapter.

(4) The department shall send a copy of the notice of lien to the employer by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(d) Any liability paid by the employer to the employee under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. section 2101 et seq.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any liability incurred by an employer under paragraph I with respect to a defined benefit pension plan may be reduced by crediting the employee with service for all purposes under such a plan for the period of the violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The amount of an employer's liability under paragraph I shall not affect and is not affected by the employee's receipt of unemployment benefits administered by the New Hampshire department of employment security.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Whenever the attorney general has reason to believe that an employer is violating or is about to violate this act, the attorney general may petition the court for an order of restitution of money or property to any person or class of persons injured thereby.  The action may be brought in the superior court of the county in which the employer allegedly in violation of this act resides or in which the principal place of business is located, or in the superior court of Merrimack county.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. An action to recover the back pay, benefits, costs, and attorneys fees and other moneys for which an employer may be liable under this chapter may be maintained against any employer by any one or more employees for and on behalf of the employee and any other employees similarly situated.  Any labor organization may also maintain an action on behalf of its members.  The action may be brought in the superior court of the county in which the employer allegedly in violation of the action resides or in which the principal place of business is located, or in the superior court of Merrimack county.  Any action brought under this paragraph shall be consolidated with any action brought by the attorney general against the same employer or employers under paragraph VII.
