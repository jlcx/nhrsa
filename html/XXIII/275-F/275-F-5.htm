&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-F:5 Extension of Layoff Period. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A layoff of more than 6 months which, at its outset, was announced to be a layoff of 6 months or less shall be treated as an employment loss under this chapter unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The extension beyond 6 months is caused by business circumstances, including unforeseeable changes in price or cost, not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension beyond 6 months will be required.
