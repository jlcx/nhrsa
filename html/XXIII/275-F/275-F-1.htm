&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-F:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to protect workers of the state by requiring advance notification of significant employment losses and by providing a means for workers to seek a remedy through administrative procedure.  The legislature finds that advance notice of a major employment loss event allows all levels of government to prepare to help a sudden large number of affected workers.  The legislature also finds that, while the United States already has a federal WARN Act, the state of New Hampshire should enforce its own program to allow quicker administrative determinations and enforcement.  This purpose is enhanced by allowing the state of New Hampshire to pursue claims on behalf of employees affected by violations of RSA 275-F and asserting liens against the assets of employers who have liability under RSA 275-F.
