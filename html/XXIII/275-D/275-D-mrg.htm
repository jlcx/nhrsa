<center><h3>Section 275-D:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-D:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that there is an increasing number of persons in the state who, in their middle and later years and having fulfilled the role of homemaker, find themselves displaced because of dissolution of marriage, death of a spouse, or other loss of family income.  As a consequence, displaced homemakers have a greatly reduced income, high rate of unemployment due to age, lack of paid work experience and discrimination, and limited opportunities to collect funds of assistance from social security, unemployment compensation, medicaid and other health insurance benefits, or pension plans of the spouse.  The problems require the establishment of programs to assist displaced homemakers.
