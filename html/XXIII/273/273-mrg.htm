&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person on whom the commissioner has imposed a penalty pursuant to RSA 273:11-a may appeal by filing a notice of appeal with the penalty appeal board within 15 business days after the commissioner's order.  If no such notice is filed within this time limit, the commissioner's order shall become final and no appeal may be taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The penalty appeal board shall hear appeals de novo and shall not be bound by prior findings or determinations of the commissioner.

I. A person who has appealed to the penalty appeal board and who is aggrieved by a final decision of the board may appeal that decision to the supreme court, but only if the notice of that appeal is filed with the court within 15 business days after the date of mailing of the decision and the notice of appeal is contemporaneously served on the commissioner and the board.  The notice of appeal shall specifically identify each error for which review is sought.  The filing of a notice of appeal shall not stay enforcement of the board's decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 60 days after the service of the notice of appeal upon the board, or within such further time allowed by the court, the board shall transmit to the court a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding before the board.  By stipulation of all parties to the review proceeding, the record may be shortened.  If the record is shortened by stipulation, the court may subsequently require additional portions of the record certified.

The court shall reverse or modify the decision of the board, or remand the case for further proceedings, as determined by the court, only if the substantial rights of the appellant had been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, or conclusions are:
