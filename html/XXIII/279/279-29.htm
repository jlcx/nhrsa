&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 279:29 Civil Actions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If any employee is paid by the employer less than the minimum wage to which the employee is entitled under the statutory minimum wage the employee may recover in a civil action the full amount of such minimum wage less any amount actually paid to the employee by the employer together with costs and such reasonable attorney's fees as may be allowed by the court, and any agreement between the employee and the employee's employer to work for less than the statutory minimum wage shall be no defense to such action.  At the request of any employee paid less than the minimum wage to which the employee was entitled under the statutory minimum wage the commissioner may take an assignment of such wage claim in trust for the assigning employee and may bring any legal action necessary to collect such claim, and the employer shall be required to pay the costs and such reasonable attorney's fees as may be allowed by the court.
