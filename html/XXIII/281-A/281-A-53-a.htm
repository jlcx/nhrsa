&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any employee receiving workers' compensation benefits pursuant to this chapter has an affirmative duty to report any changes in his or her employment status or earnings, or both, to the carrier or self-insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every carrier or self-insured shall notify any employee receiving benefits pursuant to this chapter of this duty on a form approved by the commissioner.  Such form shall indicate that failure to report any change in employment status or earnings may subject the employee to civil or criminal penalties.  The form shall further indicate that failure to complete and return the form to the carrier or self-insured within 30 days of the request may result in a suspension of the employee's compensation benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event that the employee fails to return a completed form within 30 days of the carrier or self-insured's request, the carrier or self-insured may send a notice of intent to suspend compensation benefits to the employee and to the commissioner.  If within 15 days of such notice the carrier, self-insured, or the commissioner has not received a completed form, the carrier or self-insured may petition the commissioner to suspend compensation benefits until such time as the form is filed.  Upon receipt of a petition to suspend compensation, the commissioner may order compensation payments suspended until such time as the employee files the form.  Upon receipt of the form, benefits shall be paid retroactive to the date of suspension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The carrier or self-insured shall send an employee receiving compensation benefits such a form not more than once every 3 months.
