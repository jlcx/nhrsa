&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 281-A:2, XI and XIII, 16 and 27, there shall exist a prima facie presumption that heart or lung disease in a regular, call, volunteer or retired member of a fire department is occupationally related.  However:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of this prima facie presumption only if there is on record reasonable medical evidence that such firefighter was free of such disease at the beginning of his or her employment.  It shall be the duty of the employer of a call or volunteer firefighter to provide that reasonable medical evidence.  If the employer fails to do so, the call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption regardless of the absence of the reasonable medical evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A retired firefighter who agrees to submit to any physical examination requested by his city, town, or precinct shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption only during the period of time of 5 years from the effective date of such firefighter's retirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The benefits of RSA 281-A:17, I shall not continue in effect beyond one month after a call, volunteer or permanent firefighter reaches his or her sixty-fifth birthday.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 281-A:2, XI and XIII, 16 and 27, there shall exist a prima facie presumption that cancer disease in a firefighter, whether a regular, call, volunteer, or retired member of a fire department, is occupationally related.  In order to receive this occupational cancer disability benefit, the type of cancer involved must be a type which may be caused by exposure to heat, radiation, or a known or suspected carcinogen as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  However:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of this prima facie presumption only if there is on record reasonable medical evidence that such firefighter was free of such disease at the beginning of his or her employment.  It shall be the duty of the employer of call or volunteer firefighters to provide the required reasonable medical evidence.  If the employer fails to do so, the call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption regardless of the absence of said reasonable medical evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A retired firefighter who agrees to submit to any physical examination requested by his city, town, or precinct shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption for a period of 20 years from the effective date of such firefighter's retirement.
