&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established a compensation appeals board.  The board shall consist of a pool of not less than 21 and not more than 33 members, of which, to the extent possible,  1/3 of the members shall represent labor,  1/3 of the members shall represent employers or workers' compensation insurers and  1/3 of the members shall be attorneys who shall be neutral.  Members of the board shall be appointed by the governor and council from a list of nominees submitted by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall submit at least 2 nominees for each vacancy to be filled.  Any person appointed by the governor and council who is not qualified or who ceases to be qualified in the capacity in which such person is serving on the appeals board shall be replaced by the governor and council.  Terms of board members shall be 3 years, except the initial appointments shall be staggered so that no more than  1/3 of the members' terms shall expire in the same year.  Members of the board shall have at least 5 years' experience in the area of workers' compensation.  As a condition to maintaining eligibility to hear appeals, board members shall have at least 10 hours annually of training and briefing in the area of workers' compensation and relevant disciplines.  The commissioner, or designee, with the assistance of the attorney general's staff shall supervise and approve the training.  The commissioner shall have the authority to suspend the eligibility of any member of the board who is not in compliance with such annual training requirements, and to reinstate such member's eligibility upon compliance.  The commissioner may suspend from active participation any board member who fails to render a decision or order within 30 days of the hearing as required by RSA 281-A:43, I(b).  The commissioner may rescind the suspension once the board member is in compliance with RSA 281-A:43, I(b).  Appeals from a decision of the commissioner or the commissioner's representative shall be heard de novo by a 3-member panel, composed of an attorney who shall serve as chair, one member representing labor and one member representing employers or workers' compensation insurers.  At least 2 like votes shall be necessary for a decision by the panel.  The board shall hear appeals, in accordance with RSA 281-A:43, I(b), from the decisions of the commissioner made pursuant to RSA 281-A:43.  No person who is an interested party or an employee of an interested party shall participate as a member of the panel.  The board shall conduct its proceedings in such a manner as to ensure a fair and impartial hearing.
