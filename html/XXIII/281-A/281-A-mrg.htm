&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Nothing in this subparagraph shall require such an agreement to establish that the criteria have been met.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

I. (a)(1) An employer subject to this chapter who fails to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5 by not securing payment of compensation may be assessed a civil penalty of up to $2,500;  in addition, such an employer may be assessed a civil penalty of up to $100 per employee for each day of noncompliance.  The penalties shall be assessed from the first day of the infraction not to exceed one year.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any person with control or responsibility over decisions to disburse funds and salaries and who knowingly failed to secure payment of workers' compensation under this chapter shall be held personally liable for the payment of penalties under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) All funds collected under subparagraph I(a)(1) shall be deposited into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An insurance carrier which insures an employer and fails to file with the commissioner a notice of coverage within a reasonable period of time as prescribed by rule shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $50 for each day of noncompliance.  The commissioner shall deposit all moneys collected under this subparagraph with the state treasurer for deposit into the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to the assessment of civil penalties, the commissioner may also proceed in the superior court to restrain and prohibit an employer subject to this chapter from conducting business in this state for so long as the employer fails to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5 or any other provision of this chapter or for failure to comply with orders issued by the department under this chapter.  If the commissioner seeks a temporary injunction pending a hearing on the merits, the superior court shall issue such an injunction ex parte upon prima facie evidence offered in support of the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An employee of an employer failing without sufficient cause as determined by the commissioner to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5, or dependents of such employee if death ensues, may file an application with the commissioner for compensation in accordance with the terms of this chapter.  The commissioner shall hear and determine such application for compensation in like manner as other claims.  The employer shall pay the compensation so determined to the person entitled to it no later than 10 days, excluding Sundays and holidays, after receiving notice of the amount of compensation as fixed and determined by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall file an abstract of the award in the office of the clerk of the superior court in any county in the state.  The clerk of that court shall docket such abstract in the judgment docket of that court, and such abstract shall be a lien upon the property of the employer situated in the county for a period of 8 years from the date of the award.  The commissioner shall instruct the sheriff of the county to levy execution as soon as possible thereafter, but no later than 8 years, in the same manner and with like effect as if the award were a judgment of the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. As an alternative to the procedure afforded in paragraph III, an employee of an employer failing to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5, or dependents of that employee if death ensues, may pursue any available remedy at law, free of the waivers and immunities conferred by RSA 281-A:8.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any agency or political subdivision of the state, before awarding any contract involving labor to a person who is an employer subject to this chapter, shall require that person to supply satisfactory proof that he or she has secured payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5 in connection with activities which the person proposes to undertake pursuant to the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any employer, individual, or corporate officer required to secure payment of compensation under this chapter who purposely, as defined in RSA 626:2, II(a), fails to secure such payment shall be guilty of a class B felony.

III. Each year, as actuarially determined, the legislative body shall appropriate sufficient funds to create a financial reserve until all outstanding claims are disposed of.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained;  and

(3) The action has not been barred under RSA 281-A:8.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The procedure for approval of a settlement and for safeguarding the rights of the employee or, in case of death, the rights of the administrator of the employee's estate in such cases shall be the same as is provided for protecting the rights of the employer or the employer's insurance carrier in case of a settlement made or an action at law or otherwise brought by the employee or the administrator of the employee's estate under this section.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:15 Computing Average Weekly Wages;  After-Tax Earnings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraphs II and III of this section and of RSA 281-A:32 and subject to RSA 281-A:28, 281-A:28-a and RSA 281-A:31-a, but including those persons under RSA 281-A:15, II-a, an average weekly wage shall be computed by using the method in subparagraph (a) or (b), or (c) that yields the result more favorable to the injured employee:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) By dividing the gross earnings of the injured employee in the service of the same employer during the preceding 26 weeks by that number of weeks;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) By dividing the gross earnings of the injured employee in the service of the same employer during a period exceeding 26 weeks but not exceeding 52 weeks by the appropriate number of weeks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If, however, by reason of the shortness of time during which the employee has been in the employment of the employer or because of the nature or term of the employment, it is inequitable to compute the average weekly wage using the method in subparagraph (a) or (b), regard may be had to the rate of pay designated in the injured employee's agreement of employment or to the gross earnings of persons in the same grade employed at the same work by the same employer or, if there are no persons so employed, by persons of the same grade employed in the same class of employment in the same locality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in paragraph III, the average weekly wage for any of the following injured while on duty shall be deemed to be the average weekly wage that entitles such employee to 100 percent of the state's average weekly wage as a maximum benefit:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any call firefighter or special police officer, volunteer or auxiliary member of a fire or police department or ambulance or rescue service of the state or any of its political subdivisions, whether paid or not paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any paid or not paid employee as defined by RSA 281-A:2, VII(a)(4) or (5).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any member of the general court injured in the performance of the duties as such a member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any person who is not employed and who is acting as an agent to the department of health and human services or the department of safety as described in RSA 281-A:2, VII(a)(6).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Any person who is employed and who is on leave from such employment and who is acting as an agent to the department of health and human services or the department of safety as described in RSA 281-A:2, VII(a)(6) shall have his or her average weekly wage computed under paragraph I of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Where the employee is employed as of the date of injury concurrently by 2 or more employers subject to this chapter and is disabled from any such employment, "average weekly wages'' shall be computed on the basis of the weekly wages received by the employee from all such employers at the time of the injury.  Notwithstanding paragraph II, if the computation of average weekly wage under this paragraph is more favorable to the injured employee, he shall be entitled to such amount.  The employer in whose employment the employee was injured shall be liable in the first instance for payment of all benefits.  Any additional compensation resulting from the increase in average weekly wages due to the employee's concurrent employment shall be reimbursed by the special fund created under RSA 281-A:55.  The employer in whose employment the employee was injured shall be liable for all payments under RSA 281-A:23 and 25.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For the purposes of calculating benefits under this chapter, "after-tax earnings'' means the gross earnings of the employee determined under this section, reduced by the amount which would have been paid under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 26 U.S.C. sections 3101-3126 and income tax withholding, calculated on an annual basis using as the number of exemptions the lowest number of exemptions actually claimed by the employee during the 26-week period immediately preceding the date of injury, without excess itemized deductions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The average weekly wage for national guard members shall be computed in accordance with this section, except that national guard members who are unemployed when called to state duty shall be compensated based upon their national guard rate of pay calculated in accordance with RSA 110-B:37.

For the purpose of determining the date of injury for an occupational disease, the date of injury shall be taken to be the last date of injurious exposure to the hazards of such disease or the date on which the employee first knew or reasonably should have known of the condition and its relationship to the employee's employment, whichever is the later.  For an injury caused by cumulative trauma, the date of injury shall be the date of first medical treatment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:17 Firefighter and Heart, Lung, or Cancer Disease. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 281-A:2, XI and XIII, 16 and 27, there shall exist a prima facie presumption that heart or lung disease in a regular, call, volunteer or retired member of a fire department is occupationally related.  However:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of this prima facie presumption only if there is on record reasonable medical evidence that such firefighter was free of such disease at the beginning of his or her employment.  It shall be the duty of the employer of a call or volunteer firefighter to provide that reasonable medical evidence.  If the employer fails to do so, the call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption regardless of the absence of the reasonable medical evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A retired firefighter who agrees to submit to any physical examination requested by his city, town, or precinct shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption only during the period of time of 5 years from the effective date of such firefighter's retirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The benefits of RSA 281-A:17, I shall not continue in effect beyond one month after a call, volunteer or permanent firefighter reaches his or her sixty-fifth birthday.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 281-A:2, XI and XIII, 16 and 27, there shall exist a prima facie presumption that cancer disease in a firefighter, whether a regular, call, volunteer, or retired member of a fire department, is occupationally related.  In order to receive this occupational cancer disability benefit, the type of cancer involved must be a type which may be caused by exposure to heat, radiation, or a known or suspected carcinogen as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  However:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of this prima facie presumption only if there is on record reasonable medical evidence that such firefighter was free of such disease at the beginning of his or her employment.  It shall be the duty of the employer of call or volunteer firefighters to provide the required reasonable medical evidence.  If the employer fails to do so, the call or volunteer firefighter shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption regardless of the absence of said reasonable medical evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A retired firefighter who agrees to submit to any physical examination requested by his city, town, or precinct shall have the benefit of the prima facie presumption for a period of 20 years from the effective date of such firefighter's retirement.

I. An employer subject to this chapter, or the employer's insurance carrier, shall furnish or cause to be furnished to an injured employee reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services, remedial care, nursing, medicines, and mechanical and surgical aids for such period as the nature of the injury may require.  The injured employee shall have the right to select his or her own physician.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The employer, or the employer's insurance carrier, shall pay the cost of artificial limbs, eyes, teeth, orthopedic appliances, and physical and surgical aids made necessary by such injury;  shall pay the cost of replacement or repair when such is made necessary by wear and tear or by physical change in the person;  and shall pay compensation for disability resulting from the replacement or repair, based on the employee's average wages at the time of the original injury.  Notwithstanding RSA 281-A:48, I, a party may petition the commissioner for payment of such compensation at any time, if the disability results solely from the replacement or repair.  If an employee by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment has suffered the loss of glasses, false teeth, an artificial member, or hearing aid, the employer or the employer's insurance carrier shall pay the employee an amount equal to the value of the property so lost.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If any of the foregoing objects are in existence at the time of the injury and are damaged or destroyed as a result of an injury, the employer, or the employer's insurance carrier, shall pay the cost of repair or replacement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Health care providers shall not refer an injured worker for medical care or related services to any other health care provider, organization, association, corporation, partnership or group practice in which the referring health care provider or any member of its professional association or group practice has a financial or ownership interest unless the referral is ethically appropriate and medically indicated.  The commissioner shall confirm in writing that an exception is authorized for the welfare of the specific injured worker.  This paragraph shall not affect emergency situations, referrals from a specialist to a subspecialist, referrals from a health care provider to a specialist in another field, or referrals from a primary care practitioner to a specialist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a)(1) The act of the worker in applying for workers' compensation benefits constitutes authorization to any physician, hospital, chiropractor, or other medical vendor to supply all relevant information regarding the worker's occupational injury or illness to the insurer, the insurer's representative, the worker's employer, the worker's representative, the worker's employer's representative, and the department.  Medical information relevant to a claim includes a past history of complaints of, or treatment of, a condition similar to that presented in the claim.  Any party authorized to request medical information under this subparagraph shall include the following notice in their request for medical records in bold print in a font size at least 2 points larger than that used in the request:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"This request is strictly limited to medical information relevant to the occupational injury or illness that underlies the patient's workers' compensation claim, including any past history of complaints of, or treatment of, a condition similar to that presented in the claim.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any person who supplies information in accordance with this paragraph and with rules adopted by the commissioner shall be immune from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred for such action.  The physician may require evidence from the workers' representative in his or her representative capacity.  This authorization shall be valid for the duration of the work-related injury or illness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any insurance carrier, self-insurer, or payor acting on behalf of such insurance carrier or self-insurer if any recipient of medical records receives a medical record which is clearly irrelevant to the workers' compensation claim and sends such record, or a copy of it, to another party not authorized to receive such record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner shall develop a form on which health care providers and health care facilities shall report medical, surgical or other remedial treatment.  The report shall include, but is not limited to, information relative to the up-to-date medical status of the employee, any medical information relating to the employee's ability to return to work, whether or not there are physical restrictions, what those restrictions are, the date of maximum medical improvement, and, where applicable, the percentage of permanent impairment in accordance with the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment'' published by the American Medical Association and as set forth in RSA 281-A:32, and any other information to enable the employer or insurance carrier to determine the benefits, if any, that are due and payable.  In addition to the report required under this section, the health care provider shall furnish a statement confirming that the treatment or services rendered were reasonable and necessary with respect to the bodily injury sustained.  The statement shall read as follows:  "I certify that the narrative descriptions of the principal and secondary diagnosis and the major procedures performed are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.''  The health care provider shall date and sign the statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any health care provider who without sufficient cause, as determined by the commissioner, bills an injured employee or his or her employer for services covered by insurers or self-insurers under this chapter.  There shall be no reimbursement for services rendered, unless the health care provider or health care facility giving medical, surgical, or other remedial treatment furnishes the report required in subparagraph (b) to the employer, insurance company, or claims adjusting company within 10 days of the first treatment.  First aid treatment is excluded from the 10-day reporting requirement.  Additionally, for good cause, a hearing officer may waive the 10-day reporting requirement and order remuneration paid.  The employer, claims adjustment company, self-insurer or insurer shall pay the health care provider or health care facility within 30 days of receipt of a bill for services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any employer, insurance carrier, injured employee, or attorney representing any such person, who receives any medical report, which includes, but is not limited to, information relative to the remedial treatment, care and attendance of the injured employee, shall file the report with the commissioner within 15 days after receipt of such report.  Any medical report which has not been previously filed with the commissioner shall not be received in evidence in a contested case unless the party offering the report has furnished a copy thereof to the opposing party or his attorney at least 5 days prior to the hearing at which it is offered.  The health care provider or health care facility shall also provide to the injured employee, or to his attorney, on demand, a copy of each medical report.  The injured employee shall only be charged an amount reflecting the actual cost to the health care provider or health care facility in furnishing the copy.  Each such health care provider or health care facility shall provide any additional information relating to the remedial treatment, care, and attendance of an injured employee that the commissioner may reasonably request as part of its investigation of a claim for benefits under this chapter.  Failure to provide such reports may result in imposition by the commissioner of a civil penalty of up to $2,500.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any insurance carrier, self-insurer, or payor acting on behalf of such insurance carrier or self-insurer, which without sufficient cause, as determined by the commissioner, fails, within 30 days after receipt of a medical bill:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) To make payment of such medical bill pursuant to this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) To deny such payment, notifying the health care provider, employee, and labor department of such denial.  This denial shall give a valid reason for the denial and shall advise the claimant of the right to petition the commissioner for a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. An employer subject to this chapter, or the employer's insurance carrier, may furnish or cause to be furnished, testing for the presence of a bloodborne disease when a critical exposure that arises out of and in the course of employment occurs.  Such testing shall be provided without prejudice as to the issue of the causal relationship of any subsequently diagnosed bloodborne disease to the employee's work and without prejudice to the compensability of the bloodborne disease as an occupational disease or an accidental injury for the purposes of RSA 281-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. An injured employee shall have the right to select his or her own pharmacy or pharmacist for dispensing and filling prescriptions for medicines required under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Pharmacies, including mail-order pharmacies, shall substitute generically equivalent drug products for all legend and non-legend prescriptions unless the prescribing practitioner handwrites "medically necessary'' on each paper prescription, uses electronic indications when transmitted electronically, or gives instructions when transmitted orally that the brand name drug product is medically necessary;  provided that in cases where the legend drug is less expensive, the legend drug shall be used.  Prescription refills shall not require the reissuance of the "medically necessary'' indication.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:23-a Managed Care Programs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An employer, employer's insurance carrier or self-insurer that is subject to the provisions of this chapter may satisfy the requirements and provisions of RSA 281-A:23 and the employee's rights under that section by providing a managed care program which has been approved by the commissioner.  A managed care program shall not be approved unless the commissioner finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The network or panel of health care providers is sufficiently comprehensive with respect to both geography and medical specialties, including reasonable access to treatment for injuries or personal injuries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The program provides for treatment and aids outside of the network or panel, if the necessary services or aids cannot be provided within the network or panel, or if emergency circumstances prohibit use of the network or panel, or in such other circumstances as the commissioner may find.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The program includes a process for determining professional qualifications of health care providers in the network or panel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The program provides for acceptable quality assurance measures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The program includes both inpatient and outpatient case management and rehabilitation case management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The program provides an employee with reasonable access to a second medical opinion, inside or outside the program, regarding diagnosis or the proper course of treatment, and adequate methods for resolving conflicting medical opinion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The program maintains a business office in New Hampshire for its staff of resident injury management facilitators, case managers, and rehabilitation managers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No managed care program shall limit the right to a hearing under RSA 281-A:43, I, shall require as a condition of employment that any person engage in any practice or conduct outside of the course of employment, except in connection with and as part of treatment for an injury, or shall vary the methods for calculating weekly payments for disability compensation under RSA 281-A:28 or 281-A:31 or for calculating scheduled permanent impairment awards under RSA 281-A:32.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition to approval by the commissioner as required under paragraph I, and except for approvals within the residual market made before June 30, 1995, approval of a managed care program shall require an affirmative vote of ratification of such approval by the advisory council on workers' compensation, established under RSA 281-A:62.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A managed care program shall be deemed to have been approved by the commissioner unless, within 45 days after its filing with the commissioner, the commissioner makes a preliminary determination of noncompliance, specifying in writing the reasons why the program does not appear to conform to the requirements of paragraph I.  The proponent of such program shall have the right to a hearing before the commissioner to contest the preliminary determination.  A managed care program approved or deemed approved by the commissioner shall be submitted to the advisory council within 5 days of such approval or deemed approval and shall be deemed to have been ratified by the advisory council unless, at its first regularly-scheduled meeting held at least 19 days after approval or deemed approval by the commissioner, the council, by a majority vote of all its members qualified to vote on ratification, declines to ratify the plan, specifying in writing the reasons why the program does not appear to conform to the requirements of paragraph I.  The proponent of such program shall have the right to a hearing before the council to contest the council's declination.  Neither the commissioner nor the insurance commissioner shall be qualified to vote on ratification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Every managed care program shall include a sufficient number of injury management facilitators, including resident injury management facilitators, who shall be qualified by reason of education, training and experience to manage the injured employee's medical, hospital and remedial care, vocational rehabilitation, modified duty, and return to work plans.  An injury management facilitator shall work with the injured employee, employer, and medical, hospital and other providers to ensure that the injured employee receives effective, timely, and appropriate services in order to achieve maximum medical improvement and an expeditious return to work.  Any person employed as an injury management facilitator by a managed care program shall be approved by the commissioner with ratification by the workers' compensation advisory council.  The commissioner shall, in consultation with the advisory council, by rule determine the number of facilitators which shall be sufficient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) The commissioner shall monitor approved managed care programs and shall review the effectiveness of the various programs, cost savings achieved by such programs, and the appropriateness and timeliness of services delivered to the injured employee by such programs.  The commissioner shall review each managed care program for purposes of determining the program's continued compliance with the standards for approval and delivery of service.  Such review shall take place prior to the expiration of 3 years from the date the program's approval was ratified by the advisory council.  Additional review shall take place at least once every 5 years thereafter, or whenever the commissioner determines that such review is required to ensure the program is in compliance with this section.  Upon such review, if the commissioner determines after a hearing that a managed care program has failed to maintain compliance with the standards for approval, the commissioner shall withdraw approval of the plan and immediately notify the chairperson of the advisory council of such withdrawal.  The commissioner's decision to withdraw approval of a managed care program shall be submitted to the advisory council within 5 days of such a decision and shall be deemed accepted by the advisory council unless, at its first regularly scheduled meeting held at least 19 days after the commissioner's decision, the council, by a majority vote of all its members qualified to vote on ratification, declines to ratify the decision, stating in writing the reasons why the program continues to comply with the requirements of this section and rules adopted pursuant to it.  Neither the commissioner nor the insurance commissioner shall be qualified to vote on ratification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the commissioner determines that a managed care program has failed to comply with the provisions of this section or the rules adopted to implement such section, but that such failure does not warrant withdrawal of approval of the program, the commissioner may, after notice to the managed care program and hearing, assess a civil penalty of not more than $100 for each such failure, which shall be deposited into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b.  If a managed care program fails to pay such penalty, the commissioner shall recover the penalty in a civil action in the superior court of the county of jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner, with the approval of the workers' compensation advisory council and the governor and council, may enter into such contracts as may be necessary to analyze and study the effectiveness of managed care programs.  The cost of any contracts entered into under this subparagraph shall be a charge against the workers' compensation administration fund, established under RSA 281-A:59.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If, as a result of an injury covered by this chapter, an employee is unable to perform work for which he or she has previous training or experience, the employee shall be entitled to such vocational rehabilitation services, including retraining and job placement, as may be reasonably necessary to restore such employee to suitable employment.  If such services are not voluntarily offered by the employer or the carrier and accepted by the employee, the commissioner, if necessary through informal hearing affording all parties an opportunity to be heard on the question, may refer the employee to a qualified physician or appropriate facility for evaluation of the practicability of, need for, and kind of service, treatment, or training necessary and appropriate to render the employee fit for a remunerative occupation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of such findings and after affording all parties an opportunity to be heard thereon, the commissioner may order that the services and treatment recommended or such other rehabilitation treatment or service the commissioner may deem necessary be provided at the expense of the employer or its insurance carrier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Vocational rehabilitation training, treatment or service shall not extend for a period of more than one year, except that in unusual cases by special order of the commissioner, after informal hearing, the period may be extended as is deemed to be reasonable and necessary to accomplish a successful result.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If vocational rehabilitation requires residence at or near a facility or institution which is away from the employee's customary residence, the employer shall pay the reasonable cost of the employee's board, lodging, or travel, or any combination of these.  In addition, the employer, or its insurance carrier, shall pay the reasonable cost for books, tools or other basic materials required in such rehabilitation process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If an employee refuses to accept vocational rehabilitation ordered by the commissioner, the employee may lose compensation for each week of the refusal if the commissioner so directs.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An employee of an employer who employs 5 or more employees, who has sustained an injury, shall be reinstated by the employer to the employee's former position of employment upon request for such reinstatement, if the position exists and is available and the employee is not disabled from performing the duties of such position, with reasonable accommodations for the employee's limitations.  For the purposes of this section an employee's former position is "available'' even if that position has been filled by a replacement while the injured employee was absent.  If the former position has been eliminated, the employee shall be reinstated in any other existing position which is vacant and suitable with reasonable accommodations for the employee's limitations.  A certificate by the employee's attending physician that the physician approves the employee's return to the employee's regular employment with reasonable accommodations for the employee's limitations, shall be prima facie evidence that the employee is able to perform such duties.  Reinstatement under this section shall be subject to the provisions for seniority rights and other employment restrictions contained in a valid collective bargaining agreement between the employer and a representative of the employer's employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(2) The employee accepts employment with another employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Eighteen months from the date of injury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The right to reinstatement under this section shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An employee hired on a temporary basis as a replacement for an injured employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An employee whose employer employs 4 or fewer employees at the time of the employee's injury and at the time of the employee's demand for reinstatement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) An employee employed on a construction project, when the project is completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The right to reinstatement shall not be forfeited if the employee refuses to return to the employee's regular or other offered employment without release to such employment by the employee's attending physician.

If death results from an injury, weekly compensation shall be paid to the dependents of the deceased employee in an amount provided by the compensation schedule in RSA 281-A:28 as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In all cases in which compensation is payable to a widow or widower for the benefit of herself or himself and dependent children, the commissioner shall have the power to determine from time to time, in the commissioner's discretion, what portion of the compensation shall be applied for the benefit of any such children and may order the same paid to a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the case of the remarriage of a widow or widower without dependent children, compensation payments shall cease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of the remarriage of a widow or widower who has dependent children, the unpaid balance of compensation which would otherwise become due shall be payable to the mother, father, or guardian, or such other person as the commissioner may order, for the use and benefit of such children during dependency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The employer shall pay burial expenses not to exceed $10,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any dependent, except a widow or a widower or children, who, at the time of the injury to the person covered under this chapter, is only partially dependent upon the injured person's earnings shall receive such proportion of the benefits provided for those wholly dependent as the amount of the wage contributed by the deceased to such partial dependent at the time of the injury bore to the total support of the dependent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Compensation for a dependent child shall continue until the child becomes 18 years of age, or until the child becomes 25 years of age if such child is enrolled as a full-time student in an accredited educational institution.  However, if the commissioner determines that the child is self-supporting or if the child marries or is legally adopted, compensation shall cease.  A dependent child who is physically or mentally incapacitated shall continue to receive compensation as long as the incapacity continues.  This paragraph shall have no effect on accidents or fatalities occurring prior to July 1, 1975, which shall be governed by the provisions of workers' compensation law prior to that date.

With regard to payments made pursuant to RSA 281-A:29 for compensable injuries occurring on or before June 30, 1975, the carrier or self-insured employer shall in the first instance make the adjustment in the weekly compensation rate.  Upon application, pursuant to rules adopted by the commissioner, the carrier or self-insured employer shall be reimbursed, not less than once a year, for such payments from the special fund established herein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A special fund for active cases is hereby established in the state treasury for the sole purpose of making payments in accordance with this section.  The commissioner shall administer the fund.  The state treasurer shall be the custodian of the fund, and all moneys and securities in the fund shall be held in trust by the state treasurer and shall not constitute money or property of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state treasurer is authorized to disburse moneys from the fund only upon written order of the commissioner.  The state treasurer shall be required to give bond in an amount to be fixed and with surety approved by the commissioner conditioned upon the faithful performance of the treasurer's duty as custodian of the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each carrier and self-insurer shall, under rules adopted by the commissioner, make payments to the fund in an amount equal to that proportion of 175 percent of the total disbursements made from the fund during the preceding calendar year less the amount of the net assets in the fund as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year which the total compensation paid by such carriers or self-insurers bore to the total compensation paid by all employers' carriers and self-insurers during the fiscal year which ended within the preceding calendar year.  An employer who has ceased to be a self-insurer shall continue to be liable for any assessments in the fund on account of any compensation the employer paid during such fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Where there has been default in the payment of compensation due to the insolvency of an insured employer and the employer's carrier or a self-insured employer, payment of any compensation remaining unpaid shall be made from the special fund.  Such employer and carrier, or self-insured employer and surety, if any, shall be liable for payment into the fund of the amounts paid from it by the commissioner under the authority of this section;  and, for the purposes of enforcing this liability, the commissioner, for the benefit of the fund, shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the person receiving such compensation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner shall conserve the assets of the fund.  In furtherance of this purpose, the attorney general shall appoint an employee of the department of justice to represent the fund in all proceedings brought to enforce claims against the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A single assessment shall be assessed by the commissioner against each carrier and self-insurer as soon as practicable after July 1, 1989, which shall be paid to the fund in order to carry out the purposes of this section.  The commissioner shall establish the amount of the assessment to produce the minimum amount necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, but in no event shall the assessment exceed  1/2 of one percent of compensation (including medical benefits) paid during the previous calendar year.

Where the disability for work resulting from an injury is permanent but partial in nature, the employee has reached maximum medical improvement, is able to return to work, and there is an impairment in accordance with the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment'' published by the American Medical Association as set forth in RSA 281-A:32, the employer, or insurance carrier, during such disability shall pay to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to 60 percent of the difference between his average weekly wage before the injury and the average weekly wage which he is able to earn thereafter.  However, in no instance shall the weekly compensation exceed the amounts set forth by the compensation schedule in RSA 281-A:28.  Payments shall not continue after the disability ends, nor longer than 262 weeks;  and if the partial disability begins after a period of total disability, the period of disability shall be deducted from such total period of 262 weeks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:32 Scheduled Permanent Impairment Award. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Basic Award.  Except when death results from injury, in addition to other benefits payable under this chapter, an award shall be paid to employees in amounts provided by RSA 281-A:28 for the number of weeks set forth in this section for permanent bodily loss or losses:
<PRE>
 (a) Total loss of arm 210
 (b) Total loss of hand 189
 (c) Total loss of thumb 76
 (d) Total loss of index finger 47
 (e) Total loss of middle finger 38
 (f) Total loss of ring finger 19
 (g) Total loss of little finger 9
 (h) Total loss of leg 140
 (i) Total loss of foot 98
 (j) Total loss of great toe 18
 (k) Total loss of toe, other 3
 (l) Total loss of vision--one eye 84
 (m) Total loss of vision--both eyes 300
 (n) Total loss of hearing in one ear 30
 (o) Total loss of binaural hearing 123
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Phalanges.  A loss in excess of the distal phalanx shall entitle the employee to the award for the loss of the entire digit.  A loss of a distal phalanx shall result in half the award for the loss of the entire digit.  A loss of less than one phalanx shall result in one quarter of the award for the loss of the entire digit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Amputated Arm or Leg.  The amputation of an arm or leg at or above the elbow or at or above the knee, respectively, shall entitle the employee to the award for the loss of the arm or leg.  Otherwise, amputation of an arm or leg shall result in the award for the loss of a hand or foot.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Two or More Digits.  The loss of 2 or more digits, or the loss of one or more phalanges of such number of digits, of a hand or foot, shall entitle the employee to an award proportioned to the loss of use of the hand or foot occasioned by that loss;  except that the income benefits for the loss of a hand or foot may not be exceeded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Substantial Loss of Vision.  The loss of 80 percent or more of the vision of an eye, uncorrected by an eye lens, entitles the employee to the award for the total loss of an eye.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Total Loss of Use.  An award for the permanent total loss of the use of a member shall be identical to that for the loss of the member, except that amputation of such member resulting from the original or subsequent injury shall not entitle the employee to a further award under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Partial Loss of Use.  An award for the permanent partial loss of the use of a member shall be for a period proportional to the period during which an award is payable for the total loss or the loss of the use of the member.  Such award shall be in the proportion that such partial loss bears to a total loss;  provided, however, that if subsequent amputation of such member is related to the original or a subsequent injury and results in an increased loss of such member, an additional award shall accrue on the basis of the difference between the award for the newly established loss and the award for the original loss.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Subsequent Amputation.  Upon amputation of a member resulting from an original or subsequent injury which has been preceded by the loss of a component or part of such member, an additional award shall accrue on the basis of the difference between the award for the newly established loss and the award for the original loss.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. More Than One Permanent Loss.  If an injury results in more than one permanent bodily loss specified in paragraphs I-VIII, or if the injury is to the spinal column or the spinal cord, or to the brain, or involves scarring, disfigurement, or other skin impairment resulting from a burn or burns, an award shall be made on the basis of a maximum of 350 weeks with the appropriate number of weeks to be determined in proportion to the maximum in accordance with the percent of the whole person specified for such bodily losses in the 5th edition of "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment'' published by the American Medical Association.  Injury to spinal column or spinal cord shall not be construed to permit an award under this section as a result of soft tissue injury, nor to permit such an award on the basis of more than one permanent loss, unless such injury results in loss of use of upper or lower extremities.  For the purposes of this paragraph "injury to the brain'' means cerebral or neurological impairment due to central nervous system injury as described in said American Medical Association Guide.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A Separate Right.  Except when death results from an injury, the scheduled awards under this section accrue to the injured employee simply by virtue of the loss or loss of the use of a member of the body, there being conferred upon the employee a right which is separate and independent of the rights provided by RSA 281-A:28 and 281-A:31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Payment Due.  Payment of the scheduled award becomes due upon prompt medical disclosure, after maximum medical improvement has been achieved, regarding the loss or loss of the use of the member of the body.  For the purposes of determining disability rates, the average weekly wage used shall be the average weekly wage of the employee at the time of the injury.  No later than 15 days following such disclosure the employer, or the employer's insurance carrier shall notify the commissioner as to whether it objects to the extent of the loss claimed by the employee, in which case it shall have 30 days to arrange for a medical examination, pursuant to RSA 281-A:38, and request a hearing and determination by the commissioner.  Payment of the scheduled award shall be made in a single payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Dispute Resolution.  In the event of a dispute as to the amount of compensation or the percentage of permanent partial loss or both, the commissioner shall determine the award to be made on the basis of competent medical evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Balance Paid to Estate. The balance of an unpaid weekly scheduled award shall, upon the death of the employee, be paid to the estate of the employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Rulemaking Required.  In order to reduce litigation and establish more certainty and uniformity in the rating of permanent impairment, the commissioner shall adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, incorporating by reference the 5th edition of the American Medical Association's "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment'' to determine the degree of permanent impairment and on which to base awards under this chapter.

I. Any employee entitled to receive weekly payments or medical benefits under this chapter shall, if requested by the employer or ordered by the commissioner, submit himself or herself for examination by a duly qualified health care provider, in accordance with professional standards as established by the commissioner, and paid by the employer at a time and place reasonably convenient for the employee.  The employee shall have the right to have a health care provider designated and paid by himself or herself present at such examination.  This right, however, shall not be construed to deny to the employer's health care provider the right to visit the injured employee at all reasonable times and under all reasonable conditions, so long as the employee claims compensation under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any health care provider conducting independent medical examinations under this chapter shall be certified by the appropriate specialty board as recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or obtain the approval of the commissioner for those specialties not recognized by such board.  The health care provider shall maintain a current practice in that area of specialty.  The independent medical examination shall take place within a 50-mile radius of the residence of the injured employee, unless, within the discretion of the commissioner, examination outside the 50-mile radius is necessary to obtain the services of a provider who specializes in the evaluation and treatment specific to the nature and extent of the employee's injury.  If an employer or insurance carrier provides written notice to the injured employee regarding its request for an independent medical examination, such notice shall be given 10 days before the examination and shall include the following:  "This medical examination is at the request of either the employer or insurance carrier.  The examination is not for the purpose of treatment or advice about treatment but for a medical opinion about the employee's claim.''  The injured employee shall not be required to submit to more than 2 independent medical examinations per year, unless within the discretion of the commissioner, more than 2 examinations are necessary.  An injured employee shall have the right to have a witness present during such examination.  In the event that a witness is present, including but not limited to a witness taking notes or observing, on behalf of the injured employee, the witness shall not interfere in the examination in any way.  The injured employee shall be required to sign an authorization, as prepared by the commissioner, to the effect that he or she understands that his or her medical history and condition or conditions will be discussed during said examination and that he or she waives any right to privacy that he or she may have under the circumstances of voluntarily allowing a witness to be present on his or her behalf.

If an injured employee who is covered by a managed care program established in accordance with RSA 281-A:23-a is dissatisfied with a determination made by such program relating to compensability, degree of disability or degree of impairment arising from an injury, the injured employee may apply to the commissioner for authorization to obtain an independent examination and report thereof by a duly qualified health care provider, in accordance with RSA 281-A:38, of the injured employee's choice.  The commissioner shall grant one such authorization as a matter of course.  Authorization for additional independent examination regarding the same injury may be granted only if the commissioner finds that exceptional circumstances exist which cast reasonable doubt on the accuracy of the report of the first independent examination.  The health care provider conducting an independent examination authorized by the commissioner under this section shall be entitled to a reasonable fee therefor, which shall be paid by the employer or the employer's insurance carrier.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an injured employee from obtaining an examination by a health care provider of the injured employee's choice, at the employee's expense.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any insurance carrier or self-insurer who fails, without sufficient cause as determined by the commissioner, within 21 days after notice of a claim has been received by the insurance carrier or self-insurer or 21 days from the date that benefits are due:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To make payment of compensation pursuant to RSA 281-A:28 and 281-A:31, and file a memorandum of such action with the commissioner;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To deny such compensation;  to file a memorandum of such action with the commissioner;  and to make a copy of the memorandum available to the claimant.  The memorandum shall give a valid reason for the denial and shall advise the claimant of the right to petition the commissioner for a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The memorandum described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The insurance carrier or self-insurer shall be relieved of the obligation to meet the 21-day time limit of paragraph I:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the commissioner has granted an extension of time upon showing cause;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If and to the extent that an employer, except a self-insurer, has failed to comply with the requirements of RSA 281-A:53.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon failure of any insurance carrier or self-insurer to comply with either an order for payment of compensation or an assessment of a civil penalty, the commissioner shall recover either or both in a civil action in the superior court of the county of jurisdiction.  Anyone owing a civil penalty under this section shall pay it to the commissioner, who shall deposit it into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner shall submit to the insurance commissioner the record of an insurance carrier who consistently fails to comply with the provisions of this section.  If the insurance commissioner should, upon investigation, find the carrier to be in substantial noncompliance, the commissioner shall order compliance.  If the insurance carrier shall fail to comply, the insurance commissioner shall suspend or revoke such carrier's authorization to carry out the business of workers' compensation in this state.  Likewise, the commissioner shall, as the commissioner deems necessary, suspend or revoke the self-insurer's permit of an employer or group self-insurer who consistently fails to comply with the provisions of this section and any rules adopted to enforce this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any insurance carrier or self-insurer who fails to file a timely memorandum in accordance with this section and who makes late payment to the employee, shall pay interest to such employee at the same rate as for judgments under RSA 336:1, II from the date the payment was due until it is paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In addition to paragraph V, any insurance carrier, self-insurer, or claims adjusting company who fails to file either the memorandum of payment of disability compensation or the memorandum of denial of compensation benefits in a timely manner shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $2,500.

The commissioner may rescind the suspension once the board member is in compliance with RSA 281-A:43, I(b).  Appeals from a decision of the commissioner or the commissioner's representative shall be heard de novo by a 3-member panel, composed of an attorney who shall serve as chair, one member representing labor and one member representing employers or workers' compensation insurers.  At least 2 like votes shall be necessary for a decision by the panel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:43 Hearings and Awards. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) In a controversy as to the responsibility of an employer or the employer's insurance carrier for the payment of compensation and other benefits under this chapter, any party at interest may petition the commissioner in writing for a hearing and award.  The petition shall be sent to the commissioner at the department's offices in Concord and shall set forth the reasons for requesting the hearing and the questions in dispute which the applicant expects to be resolved.  The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative shall schedule a hearing, either in Concord or at a location nearest the employee as determined by the commissioner, by fixing its time and place and giving notice at least 14 days prior to the date for which it is scheduled.  The hearing date shall be set for a time not to exceed 6 weeks from the date the petition was received.  In those instances where an expedited hearing is requested, the petition for hearing shall set forth the facts in sufficient detail to support the request for an expedited hearing.  The commissioner, or his or her authorized agent shall, in his or her discretion, determine whether the need exists for an expedited hearing.  Any requests for an expedited hearing shall be periodically reviewed by the commissioner to determine whether such requests are given proper attention.  The commissioner shall also identify any overutilization by the requesting parties and responses given to such requests by the commissioner.  An annual report of the expedited requests, responses, the number of continuances, the reasons for such continuances, the number of requests for hearing, and the time within which the hearings were held shall be made annually to the advisory council established in RSA 281-A:62.  The notice may be given in hand or by certified mail, return receipt requested.  Continuances of any hearing are discouraged;  however, should a continuance be necessary, the parties requesting such continuance shall file with the department a written petition for such continuance at least 7 days prior to the hearing.  Failure to file such a petition shall bar any right to a continuance.  Thereafter, a continuance may only be granted upon the commissioner's finding that a compelling need exists so as to require a continuance.  At such hearing, it shall be incumbent upon all parties to present all available evidence and the person conducting the hearing shall give full consideration to all evidence presented.  In addition, the person conducting the hearing shall freely and comprehensively examine all witnesses to determine the merits of the matter.  Also, the person conducting the hearing may recess the hearing to a date certain and direct the parties, or either of them, to provide such further information that may be necessary to decide the matter.  No later than 30 days after the hearing, the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative shall render a decision and shall forthwith notify the parties of it.  When appropriate, the commissioner, or his or her authorized representative, may render a decision at the hearing.  Unless excused for good cause shown, failure of any or all parties at interest to appear at a duly scheduled hearing or to petition for a continuance shall bar such parties from any further action concerning an adverse decision, a decision by default, or a dismissal of a petition for hearing and award.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An appeal from a decision of the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative shall be taken to the board no later than 30 days from the date of such decision.  Upon the filing of an appeal the board shall, within 6 weeks hold a full hearing on the appeal;  but, in no case shall such an appeal suspend the operation of an award unless the hearing officer from which the appeal was taken shall so order.  The board shall give notice of the scheduled hearing at least 14 days prior to the date for which it is scheduled.  Continuances of any hearing are discouraged;  however, should a continuance be necessary, the parties requesting such continuance shall file with the board a written petition for such continuance at least 7 days prior to the hearing.  Failure to file such a petition shall bar any right to a continuance.  Thereafter, a continuance may only be granted upon the commissioner's finding that a compelling need exists so as to require a continuance.  The board shall make its decision or order setting forth its findings of fact and rulings of law within 30 days of the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any party in interest aggrieved by any order or decision of the board may appeal to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Within 7 days of receipt of a notice of hearing under subparagraph I(a) or I(b), the insurance carrier or group-funded self insurance plan shall mail a copy of such notice to the affected employer.  The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any insurance carrier or group-funded self insurance plan which fails, without sufficient cause as determined by the commissioner, to comply with the provisions of this subparagraph.  All funds collected under this subparagraph shall be paid over to the state treasurer for deposit into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If a request for cancellation or continuance of a hearing is filed less than 7 days prior to a scheduled hearing, the commissioner may impose an administrative penalty of up to $500 upon the person filing the request if the commissioner determines that such person has repeatedly filed such requests in abusive disregard of the convenience of other parties or the orderly processes of the department.  If such a penalty is imposed upon a person representing a party, the cost of the penalty shall not be passed on to the party represented.  All funds collected under this subparagraph shall be paid over to the state treasurer for deposit into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A decision of the commissioner, the commissioner's authorized representative, or the board shall take effect and shall become final, in the absence of an appeal from it, 30 days from the date of the decision.  Payment of weekly compensation and entitlement to medical and vocational benefits, if necessary and so ordered by the commissioner or the board, shall begin or continue as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the decision's effective date, and shall not be terminated except in accordance with the terms of the decision or of a final court determination.  If the commissioner determines that the employer or carrier has failed to comply with any order, then the commissioner may assess a penalty not to exceed $100 for each day of noncompliance, beginning on the date of notification of its assessment.  Upon continued failure to comply with an order to make payment of the compensation or medical benefits, or to institute vocational rehabilitation, or to pay the penalty, or any combination thereof, the commissioner shall petition the superior court for an injunction to comply.  The commissioner shall deposit into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b any penalty collected under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The commissioner may conduct investigations and hold hearings to resolve disputes between an employer and the employer's workers' compensation carrier regarding whether persons engaged by the employer are employees or independent contractors for the purposes of determining whether an additional premium charge is to be paid by the employer for workers' compensation insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any party in interest aggrieved by any order or decision of the commissioner under this paragraph may appeal to the superior court.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:44 Award of Fees and Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) In any dispute over the amount of the benefit payable under this chapter which is appealed to the board or supreme court or both, the employee, if such employee prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the board or court and interest on that portion of any award the payment of which is contested.  For the purposes of this paragraph, to "prevail'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the employee is the appealing party, the employee shall have received an award for disability benefits, medical, hospital, and remedial care, a scheduled permanent impairment award, vocational rehabilitation, or reinstatement of the employee, which is greater in amount than awarded by the decision which is the subject of the appeal;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the appeal is by the employer or insurance carrier, the appealed decision shall have been affirmed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the insurance carrier appeals multiple issues and the employee prevails on some, but not all, of the issues appealed, the board or court shall apportion and award fees to the employee's attorney only for the reasonable fees apportioned to the issues which were affirmed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Interest shall be calculated at the same rate as for judgments under RSA 336:1, II, and the state treasurer shall periodically transmit the applicable rate to the commissioner in the same manner provided for notice to the administrative office of the courts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Interest on awards for disability indemnity benefits shall be computed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) From the date of injury where compensability is in dispute in the first instance and benefits have not been paid;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) From the date of termination or reduction of benefits where the extent of disability is in dispute or where benefits were terminated or reduced for some other reason.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Interest on awards for a scheduled permanent impairment shall be computed from the date when payment is due under RSA 281-A:32, XI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Interest on awards for medical, hospital, and remedial care shall be payable only on amounts which have been paid directly by the employee and not by a third party, in which case interest shall be computed from the date of such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No attorney representing a claimant shall contract for, charge for, or collect a fee for legal service rendered to the claimant at the department level unless the fee has been approved by the commissioner.  In determining the amount of the allowable fee, the commissioner shall consider, among other things, the nature, length and complexity of the service performed, the usual and customary charge for work of the like kind and the benefit accruing to the claimant as a result of the legal service performed;  provided, however, that when an insurance carrier, self insurer, or payor acting on behalf of such carrier or self insurer disputes the causal relationship of a medical bill to the claimant's injury, or whether a medical bill was required by the nature of the injury, and denies payment of such bill, is after a hearing, ordered to pay or reimburse the bill by the commissioner, the claimant shall be entitled to reimbursement of reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the commissioner.  The claimant shall be entitled to reasonable fees and costs pending appeal.  In the event that the medical bill is voluntarily accepted less than 7 business days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing, the claimant shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the commissioner unless the carrier can prove a justifiable reason for the delay in accepting the bill.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an employee's right to compensation, other benefits, or both, under this chapter is not in dispute either as to eligibility or amount, but a dispute arises between successive employers or between successive insurance carriers for the same employer regarding liability for benefits, the commissioner, following notice to all interested parties and hearing, shall enter an order setting forth the liability of an employer or insurance carrier for the payment of compensation, other benefits, or both, in the first instance.  The employer or insurance carrier ruled liable shall immediately start payment pending final determination.  The commissioner may make such orders for the deposit of security as may be necessary.  When the issue of liability is finally determined, either the commissioner or the court in which the issue is finally resolved shall enter an order making such financial adjustment as may be appropriate in order to effectuate the decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in RSA 281-A:54, if compensation is payable for an occupational disease, the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of such disease, and any insurance carrier on the risk at the time such employee was last so exposed, shall alone be liable for that compensation without a right to contribution from any prior employer or insurance carrier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in RSA 281-A:54, if compensation is payable for an injury, other than an occupational disease, which aggravates a preexisting physical condition, the employer in whose employment the employee sustained the most recent injurious incident and any insurance carrier on the risk when such injurious incident occurred, shall alone be liable for any benefit allowable under this chapter without a right to contribution from any prior employer or insurance carrier.

I. Any party at interest with regard to an injury occurring after July 1, 1965, may petition the commissioner to review a denial or an award of compensation made pursuant to RSA 281-A:40 by filing a petition with the commissioner not later than the fourth anniversary of the date of such denial or the last payment of compensation under such award or pursuant to RSA 281-A:40, as the case may be, upon the ground of a change in conditions, mistake as to the nature or extent of the injury or disability, fraud, undue influence, or coercion.  This section shall not apply to requests for extensions of medical and hospital benefits, or other remedial care, which shall be governed solely by those sections of this chapter relating thereto.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:53 Responsibility of Employer to Provide Vital Information. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every employer or self-insurer shall record in sufficient detail and shall report or cause to be reported to the commissioner any injury sustained by an employee in the course of employment as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days after the employer learns of the occurrence of such an injury.  If an injury results in a disability extending beyond 3 days, the employer shall file with the commissioner a supplemental report giving notice of such disability as soon as possible after such waiting period, but no later than 7 days after the accidental injury.  The employer shall supply a copy of either report to the nearest claims office of the employer's insurance carrier.  A self-insurer need not file the supplemental report with the commissioner and may keep the insurance copy of the employer's first report as a file copy.  If any employer fails without sufficient cause as determined by the commissioner to file a first report as set forth in this paragraph, the commissioner shall assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500.  If any employer fails to pay a civil penalty, the commissioner shall recover such penalty payment by a civil action in the superior court of the county of jurisdiction.  Civil penalties owed under this section shall be paid to the commissioner, who shall deposit them into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any employer who consistently fails to make available to the commissioner and to that employer's insurance carrier the information required by the carrier to make payment of disability compensation in a manner consistent with RSA 281-A:42 shall, after such employer has been given due notice of noncompliance and an opportunity to comply, be assessed by the commissioner a civil penalty of not more than $100.  If an employer fails to pay such penalty or to comply with the requirements of paragraph I, the commissioner shall recover the penalty and petition for an injunction in a civil action in the superior court of the county of jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. On or after July 1, 2006, all "First Reports of Injury'' shall be filed by the insurance carrier or self-insured employer electronically in a manner prescribed by the department.  The commissioner may grant an insurance carrier or self-insured employer a variance if the carrier or self-insured employer documents to the satisfaction of the commissioner that compliance would cause the carrier or self-insured employer "undue hardship'' which, for the purposes of this section, means significant difficulty or expense.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any employee receiving workers' compensation benefits pursuant to this chapter has an affirmative duty to report any changes in his or her employment status or earnings, or both, to the carrier or self-insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every carrier or self-insured shall notify any employee receiving benefits pursuant to this chapter of this duty on a form approved by the commissioner.  Such form shall indicate that failure to report any change in employment status or earnings may subject the employee to civil or criminal penalties.  The form shall further indicate that failure to complete and return the form to the carrier or self-insured within 30 days of the request may result in a suspension of the employee's compensation benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event that the employee fails to return a completed form within 30 days of the carrier or self-insured's request, the carrier or self-insured may send a notice of intent to suspend compensation benefits to the employee and to the commissioner.  If within 15 days of such notice the carrier, self-insured, or the commissioner has not received a completed form, the carrier or self-insured may petition the commissioner to suspend compensation benefits until such time as the form is filed.  Upon receipt of a petition to suspend compensation, the commissioner may order compensation payments suspended until such time as the employee files the form.  Upon receipt of the form, benefits shall be paid retroactive to the date of suspension.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:54 Payment for Second Injuries From Special Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an employee who has a permanent physical or mental impairment, as defined in RSA 281-A:2, XIV, from any cause or origin incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course of such employee's employment on or after July 1, 1975, which results in compensation liability for a disability that is greater by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or the employer's insurance carrier shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation provided by this chapter.  However, the commissioner shall reimburse such employer or insurance carrier from the special fund created by RSA 281-A:55 for all compensation payments subsequent to those payable for the first 104 weeks of disability.  Provided, however, that prior to the first 104 weeks of disability, the employer shall be reimbursed 50 percent after the first $10,000 paid on all compensation for temporary total, temporary partial, permanent partial, permanent total, medical, or rehabilitation benefits for all injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1991.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the subsequent injury of such an employee occurring on or after July 1, 1975, shall result in the death of the employee and it shall be determined that the death would not have occurred except for such preexisting permanent physical or mental impairment, the employer or the employer's insurance carrier shall in the first instance pay the compensation prescribed by this chapter.  However, the commissioner shall reimburse such employer or insurance carrier from the special fund created by RSA 281-A:55 for all compensation payable in excess of 104 weeks, provided, however, that prior to the 104 weeks, the employer shall be reimbursed 50 percent over and above the first $10,000 of all compensation, medical, rehabilitation benefits, or funeral expenses which the employer was required to pay for all injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1991.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In order to qualify under this section for reimbursement from the special fund, an employer shall establish by written records, or by affidavit executed at the time of hire or retention in employment, that the employer had knowledge of the employee's permanent physical or mental impairment at the time that the employee was hired or at the time that the employee was retained in employment after the employer acquired such knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The special fund shall not be bound as to any question of law or fact by reason of an award or an adjudication to which it was not a party or in relation to which it was not notified at least 3 weeks prior to the award or adjudication that it might be subject to liability for the injury or death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An employer or insurance carrier shall notify the commissioner of any possible claim against the special fund as soon as practicable but in no event later than 100 weeks after the injury or death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Reimbursement for payments by an insurance carrier under this section shall be made periodically at the discretion of the commissioner by orders drawn on the state treasury to be charged against the special fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. No benefit shall be payable under this section for injuries or illnesses occurring prior to July 1, 1975;  provided, however, that persons who incurred an injury or illness prior to July 1, 1975, which was of the type specified in former RSA 281:47 shall continue to be paid out of the special fund created by RSA 281-A:55.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Payments made by an employer or the employer's insurance carrier under RSA 281-A:25 and 281-A:32 shall be in lieu of payments under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Employers who incur costs for job modification for the purposes of retaining individuals, including those reinstated under RSA 281-A:25-a, for which a plan for modification has been approved by the commissioner shall be reimbursed 50 percent of the cost for such job modifications from the special fund for second injuries under RSA 281-A:55.  Such reimbursement shall not exceed $5,000 per employer per year.  Before reimbursement shall be authorized, the employer shall submit the plan for modification to the commissioner for approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. An employer who reinstates an employee under RSA 281-A:25-a shall not be eligible for reimbursement from this fund should the employee become injured.
