<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An employer subject to this chapter, or the employer's insurance carrier, shall furnish or cause to be furnished to an injured employee reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services, remedial care, nursing, medicines, and mechanical and surgical aids for such period as the nature of the injury may require.  The injured employee shall have the right to select his or her own physician.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The employer, or the employer's insurance carrier, shall pay the cost of artificial limbs, eyes, teeth, orthopedic appliances, and physical and surgical aids made necessary by such injury;  shall pay the cost of replacement or repair when such is made necessary by wear and tear or by physical change in the person;  and shall pay compensation for disability resulting from the replacement or repair, based on the employee's average wages at the time of the original injury.  Notwithstanding RSA 281-A:48, I, a party may petition the commissioner for payment of such compensation at any time, if the disability results solely from the replacement or repair.  If an employee by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment has suffered the loss of glasses, false teeth, an artificial member, or hearing aid, the employer or the employer's insurance carrier shall pay the employee an amount equal to the value of the property so lost.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If any of the foregoing objects are in existence at the time of the injury and are damaged or destroyed as a result of an injury, the employer, or the employer's insurance carrier, shall pay the cost of repair or replacement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Health care providers shall not refer an injured worker for medical care or related services to any other health care provider, organization, association, corporation, partnership or group practice in which the referring health care provider or any member of its professional association or group practice has a financial or ownership interest unless the referral is ethically appropriate and medically indicated.  The commissioner shall confirm in writing that an exception is authorized for the welfare of the specific injured worker.  This paragraph shall not affect emergency situations, referrals from a specialist to a subspecialist, referrals from a health care provider to a specialist in another field, or referrals from a primary care practitioner to a specialist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a)(1) The act of the worker in applying for workers' compensation benefits constitutes authorization to any physician, hospital, chiropractor, or other medical vendor to supply all relevant information regarding the worker's occupational injury or illness to the insurer, the insurer's representative, the worker's employer, the worker's representative, the worker's employer's representative, and the department.  Medical information relevant to a claim includes a past history of complaints of, or treatment of, a condition similar to that presented in the claim.  Any party authorized to request medical information under this subparagraph shall include the following notice in their request for medical records in bold print in a font size at least 2 points larger than that used in the request:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"This request is strictly limited to medical information relevant to the occupational injury or illness that underlies the patient's workers' compensation claim, including any past history of complaints of, or treatment of, a condition similar to that presented in the claim.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any person who supplies information in accordance with this paragraph and with rules adopted by the commissioner shall be immune from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred for such action.  The physician may require evidence from the workers' representative in his or her representative capacity.  This authorization shall be valid for the duration of the work-related injury or illness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any insurance carrier, self-insurer, or payor acting on behalf of such insurance carrier or self-insurer if any recipient of medical records receives a medical record which is clearly irrelevant to the workers' compensation claim and sends such record, or a copy of it, to another party not authorized to receive such record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner shall develop a form on which health care providers and health care facilities shall report medical, surgical or other remedial treatment.  The report shall include, but is not limited to, information relative to the up-to-date medical status of the employee, any medical information relating to the employee's ability to return to work, whether or not there are physical restrictions, what those restrictions are, the date of maximum medical improvement, and, where applicable, the percentage of permanent impairment in accordance with the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment'' published by the American Medical Association and as set forth in RSA 281-A:32, and any other information to enable the employer or insurance carrier to determine the benefits, if any, that are due and payable.  In addition to the report required under this section, the health care provider shall furnish a statement confirming that the treatment or services rendered were reasonable and necessary with respect to the bodily injury sustained.  The statement shall read as follows:  "I certify that the narrative descriptions of the principal and secondary diagnosis and the major procedures performed are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.''  The health care provider shall date and sign the statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any health care provider who without sufficient cause, as determined by the commissioner, bills an injured employee or his or her employer for services covered by insurers or self-insurers under this chapter.  There shall be no reimbursement for services rendered, unless the health care provider or health care facility giving medical, surgical, or other remedial treatment furnishes the report required in subparagraph (b) to the employer, insurance company, or claims adjusting company within 10 days of the first treatment.  First aid treatment is excluded from the 10-day reporting requirement.  Additionally, for good cause, a hearing officer may waive the 10-day reporting requirement and order remuneration paid.  The employer, claims adjustment company, self-insurer or insurer shall pay the health care provider or health care facility within 30 days of receipt of a bill for services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any employer, insurance carrier, injured employee, or attorney representing any such person, who receives any medical report, which includes, but is not limited to, information relative to the remedial treatment, care and attendance of the injured employee, shall file the report with the commissioner within 15 days after receipt of such report.  Any medical report which has not been previously filed with the commissioner shall not be received in evidence in a contested case unless the party offering the report has furnished a copy thereof to the opposing party or his attorney at least 5 days prior to the hearing at which it is offered.  The health care provider or health care facility shall also provide to the injured employee, or to his attorney, on demand, a copy of each medical report.  The injured employee shall only be charged an amount reflecting the actual cost to the health care provider or health care facility in furnishing the copy.  Each such health care provider or health care facility shall provide any additional information relating to the remedial treatment, care, and attendance of an injured employee that the commissioner may reasonably request as part of its investigation of a claim for benefits under this chapter.  Failure to provide such reports may result in imposition by the commissioner of a civil penalty of up to $2,500.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of up to $2,500 on any insurance carrier, self-insurer, or payor acting on behalf of such insurance carrier or self-insurer, which without sufficient cause, as determined by the commissioner, fails, within 30 days after receipt of a medical bill:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) To make payment of such medical bill pursuant to this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) To deny such payment, notifying the health care provider, employee, and labor department of such denial.  This denial shall give a valid reason for the denial and shall advise the claimant of the right to petition the commissioner for a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. An employer subject to this chapter, or the employer's insurance carrier, may furnish or cause to be furnished, testing for the presence of a bloodborne disease when a critical exposure that arises out of and in the course of employment occurs.  Such testing shall be provided without prejudice as to the issue of the causal relationship of any subsequently diagnosed bloodborne disease to the employee's work and without prejudice to the compensability of the bloodborne disease as an occupational disease or an accidental injury for the purposes of RSA 281-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. An injured employee shall have the right to select his or her own pharmacy or pharmacist for dispensing and filling prescriptions for medicines required under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Pharmacies, including mail-order pharmacies, shall substitute generically equivalent drug products for all legend and non-legend prescriptions unless the prescribing practitioner handwrites "medically necessary'' on each paper prescription, uses electronic indications when transmitted electronically, or gives instructions when transmitted orally that the brand name drug product is medically necessary;  provided that in cases where the legend drug is less expensive, the legend drug shall be used.  Prescription refills shall not require the reissuance of the "medically necessary'' indication.
