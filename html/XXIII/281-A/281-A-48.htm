<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any party at interest with regard to an injury occurring after July 1, 1965, may petition the commissioner to review a denial or an award of compensation made pursuant to RSA 281-A:40 by filing a petition with the commissioner not later than the fourth anniversary of the date of such denial or the last payment of compensation under such award or pursuant to RSA 281-A:40, as the case may be, upon the ground of a change in conditions, mistake as to the nature or extent of the injury or disability, fraud, undue influence, or coercion.  This section shall not apply to requests for extensions of medical and hospital benefits, or other remedial care, which shall be governed solely by those sections of this chapter relating thereto.  This section shall not apply to lump sum agreements, except upon the grounds of fraud, undue influence, or coercion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the filing of a petition and after notice to all interested parties and hearing, the commissioner shall enter an order, stating the reasons therefor, either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Granting or denying an original award of compensation if none has previously been paid;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Ending, diminishing, or increasing the compensation previously paid or fixed by award, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a petitioner files for reducing or for ending compensation, the petitioner shall submit along with the petition medical evidence that the injured employee is physically able to perform his or her regular work or is able to engage in gainful employment.  On the basis of such medical evidence, the commissioner may authorize suspension of further payments pending a hearing on the petition;  otherwise, compensation shall continue on the basis of the existing award pending the hearing and any further order by the commissioner.  All procedure on a petition under this section shall be the same as provided in this chapter for original hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A review under this section shall not affect an award with respect to money already paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any party at interest who is dissatisfied with the decision of the commissioner under this section may appeal to the compensation appeals board, established under RSA 281-A:42-a, in the same manner as provided in RSA 281-A:43.
