&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:37 Lump Sum Payments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Where there has been a determination of compensability by the employer, the employer's insurance carrier, the commissioner, the commissioner's designated representative or the board, in cases where there have been at least 12 months of continuous disability, or where the best interests of all concerned will be served, lump sum agreements may be approved by the commissioner.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the employer or the employer's insurance carrier from making a determination of compensability at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In no event shall the medical provisions of this chapter be lump summed.  The costs of vocational rehabilitation services as provided in RSA 281-A:25 may be lump summed provided the lump sum agreement specifically sets forth the portion of the lump sum amount attributable to vocational rehabilitation services.  Such sum shall be held in escrow by the employer or insurance carrier and shall be paid to the provider of the vocational rehabilitation services for services incurred by the claimant.  Any lump sum agreement which proposes to include the costs of vocational rehabilitation services shall also specify the nature of the vocational rehabilitation services to be provided to the claimant and shall require the claimant to commence such vocational rehabilitation services within 6 months of the approval of the agreement.  The employer and the insurance carrier shall not be liable for vocational rehabilitation services incurred if the claimant fails to commence use of vocational rehabilitation services within 6 months after approval of the lump sum agreement, unless the period is extended by the commissioner for good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No lump sum agreement shall be approved under this section except after a hearing before the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any lump sum payment which does not comply with this section shall not be included in data filed with the insurance department for ratemaking purposes nor shall it affect the employer's experience modification factor.
