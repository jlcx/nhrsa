&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 281-A:31-a Compensation for Permanent Partial Disability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Where the disability for work resulting from an injury is permanent but partial in nature, the employee has reached maximum medical improvement, is able to return to work, and there is an impairment in accordance with the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment'' published by the American Medical Association as set forth in RSA 281-A:32, the employer, or insurance carrier, during such disability shall pay to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to 60 percent of the difference between his average weekly wage before the injury and the average weekly wage which he is able to earn thereafter.  However, in no instance shall the weekly compensation exceed the amounts set forth by the compensation schedule in RSA 281-A:28.  Payments shall not continue after the disability ends, nor longer than 262 weeks;  and if the partial disability begins after a period of total disability, the period of disability shall be deducted from such total period of 262 weeks.
