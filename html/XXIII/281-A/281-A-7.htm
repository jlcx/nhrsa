<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a)(1) An employer subject to this chapter who fails to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5 by not securing payment of compensation may be assessed a civil penalty of up to $2,500;  in addition, such an employer may be assessed a civil penalty of up to $100 per employee for each day of noncompliance.  The penalties shall be assessed from the first day of the infraction not to exceed one year.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any person with control or responsibility over decisions to disburse funds and salaries and who knowingly failed to secure payment of workers' compensation under this chapter shall be held personally liable for the payment of penalties under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) All funds collected under subparagraph I(a)(1) shall be deposited into the department of labor restricted fund established in RSA 273:1-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An insurance carrier which insures an employer and fails to file with the commissioner a notice of coverage within a reasonable period of time as prescribed by rule shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $50 for each day of noncompliance.  The commissioner shall deposit all moneys collected under this subparagraph with the state treasurer for deposit into the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to the assessment of civil penalties, the commissioner may also proceed in the superior court to restrain and prohibit an employer subject to this chapter from conducting business in this state for so long as the employer fails to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5 or any other provision of this chapter or for failure to comply with orders issued by the department under this chapter.  If the commissioner seeks a temporary injunction pending a hearing on the merits, the superior court shall issue such an injunction ex parte upon prima facie evidence offered in support of the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An employee of an employer failing without sufficient cause as determined by the commissioner to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5, or dependents of such employee if death ensues, may file an application with the commissioner for compensation in accordance with the terms of this chapter.  The commissioner shall hear and determine such application for compensation in like manner as other claims.  The employer shall pay the compensation so determined to the person entitled to it no later than 10 days, excluding Sundays and holidays, after receiving notice of the amount of compensation as fixed and determined by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall file an abstract of the award in the office of the clerk of the superior court in any county in the state.  The clerk of that court shall docket such abstract in the judgment docket of that court, and such abstract shall be a lien upon the property of the employer situated in the county for a period of 8 years from the date of the award.  The commissioner shall instruct the sheriff of the county to levy execution as soon as possible thereafter, but no later than 8 years, in the same manner and with like effect as if the award were a judgment of the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. As an alternative to the procedure afforded in paragraph III, an employee of an employer failing to comply with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5, or dependents of that employee if death ensues, may pursue any available remedy at law, free of the waivers and immunities conferred by RSA 281-A:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any agency or political subdivision of the state, before awarding any contract involving labor to a person who is an employer subject to this chapter, shall require that person to supply satisfactory proof that he or she has secured payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of RSA 281-A:5 in connection with activities which the person proposes to undertake pursuant to the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any employer, individual, or corporate officer required to secure payment of compensation under this chapter who purposely, as defined in RSA 626:2, II(a), fails to secure such payment shall be guilty of a class B felony.
