&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 278:7 Local, Regional and State Joint Apprenticeship Committees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Local and state joint apprenticeship committees may be approved, in any trade or group of trades, in cities, regions of the state or trade areas, by the OA and the council, whenever the apprentice training needs of such trade or group of trades or such regions justify such establishment.  Such local, regional or state joint apprenticeship committees shall be composed of an equal number of employer and employee representatives selected by the respective local or state employer and employee organizations in such trade or group of trades;  also such advisory members representing local boards or other agencies as may be deemed advisable.  In a trade or group of trades in which there is no bona fide employer or employee organization, a joint committee may be composed of persons known to represent the interests of employers and of employees respectively, or a state joint apprenticeship committee may be approved as, or the council may act itself as, the joint committee in such trade or group of trades.  Subject to the review of the OA and the council, and in accordance with the standards established by the Office of Apprenticeship and the council, such committees may devise standards for apprenticeship agreements and give such aid as may be necessary in their operation, in their respective trades and localities.
