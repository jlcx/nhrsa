&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 277-B:17-a Tax Credits.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For purposes of determination of business profits tax credits under RSA 77-A, Coos county job creation credits under RSA 162-Q, economic revitalization zone credits under RSA 162-N, or any other available statutory tax credits provided by this state that are based on employment, leased employees shall be deemed employees solely of the client company if an election is made pursuant to RSA 77-E:13-a.  A client company shall be entitled to the benefit of any such tax credit arising as the result of the employment of leased employees of such client company.  Notwithstanding that the employee leasing company is the W-2 reporting employer, the client company shall continue to qualify for business profits tax credits under RSA 77-A, Coos county job creation credits under RSA 162-Q, economic revitalization zone credits under RSA 162-N, or any other available statutory tax credits.  Leased employees working for other client companies of the employee leasing company shall not be counted together.  Each employing leasing company shall provide, upon request by a client company, state agency, or department responsible for administration of any such tax credit, employment information reasonably required by such agency or department and necessary to support any request, claim, application, or other action by a client company seeking any such tax credit.  This section shall not apply to the administration of RSA 282-A.
