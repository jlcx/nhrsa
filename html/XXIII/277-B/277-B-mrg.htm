Every applicant for a renewal license shall file with the commissioner a completed application at least 60 days before license expiration together with a renewal application fee of $100.  The commissioner shall act upon such renewal application within said 60-day period.  A licensee shall pay an annual fee for a license of $500 per year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. As a condition of licensure under this chapter, any applicant that is not a resident of, or domiciled in this state shall first be licensed as an employee leasing company in the state in which it is a resident or is domiciled if licensing is required by such state.  Such applicant shall pay the application and license fees in paragraph I, or those application and license fees charged by the domiciliary state, whichever are greater.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may issue a restricted license to an employee leasing company domiciled in another state for limited operation within this state under the following conditions, but only if the foreign jurisdiction has substantially the same conditions for licensure of a New Hampshire domiciled employee leasing company in such jurisdiction:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The applicant does not maintain an office in this state, does not maintain a sales force or have a sales representative in this state, or solicit clients residing or domiciled in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The applicant shall not have more than 100 leased employees working in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A restricted licensee shall pay an annual fee of $100, or a fee in the same amount required by the foreign jurisdiction, whichever is greater.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every application for an original, renewal, or restricted license, shall be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that the leased employees are covered by workers' compensation insurance issued by a carrier admitted to write such coverage in this state.  No unlicensed leasing company shall be provided workers' compensation coverage.  An employee leasing company may meet its obligation to provide such insurance for leased employees through no more than 2 policies.  When 2 policies are issued, one shall be issued in the voluntary market, and the other shall be issued in the residual market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon request of a client company, an employee leasing company insured in the voluntary market shall request that the carrier of the employee leasing company make available claims data on a client company basis to the National Council on Compensation Insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An employee leasing company insured in the residual market shall only be issued the National Council on Compensation Insurance Multiple Coordinated Policy as approved by the insurance commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A client company shall be assigned its claims data upon terminating its relationship with an employee leasing company which data shall be used in calculating the client company's subsequent workers' compensation premium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An employee leasing company may meet its obligation to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage for leased employees through 2 carriers, provided that each client company's leased employees shall be covered by only one carrier and that such coverage shall clearly delineate such client company employees by client company name and federal identification number.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The application shall also be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that any health insurance benefits covering leased employees are provided pursuant to the provisions of RSA 277-B:11, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Each application for an original, renewal, or restricted license, shall be accompanied by a certification that the applicant does not conduct a temporary help service through the same entity as the applicant's employee leasing company and that both entities do not commingle any financial components of the operations.

<center><h3>Section 277-B:6</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 277-B:6 Employee Leasing Company License;  Financial Assurances Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every application for issuance or renewal of a license as an employee leasing company shall be accompanied by an audited financial statement prepared by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Such statement shall show a minimum working capital of $100,000.  At the time of application for a new license, the employee leasing company shall submit its most recent audit which may not be older than 13 months.  Thereafter, an employee leasing company shall file a succeeding audit, performed within 12 months before the date of application or renewal, showing a minimum working capital of $100,000.  An employee leasing company with less than $100,000 in working capital at renewal shall have 180 days to eliminate the deficiency.  During that 180 days the employee leasing company shall submit quarterly financial statements to the department of labor accompanied by an attestation of the chief executive officer that all wages, taxes, workers' compensation premiums, and employee benefits have been paid by the employee leasing company.  As an alternative, an employee leasing company may, as approved by the commissioner, provide a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or securities with a minimum market value of $100,000 to the department.  For any employee leasing company whose annual financial statements do not indicate positive working capital, the amount of the bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or securities shall be $100,000 plus an amount sufficient to cover the deficit in working capital.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to the requirement in paragraph I, the commissioner may require an employee leasing company to deposit in a depository designated by the commissioner, a bond or securities with a market value, deemed sufficient by the commissioner to assure payment of wages and benefits.  The securities so deposited shall include authorization to the commissioner to sell any such securities in an amount sufficient to pay any wages, benefits or other entitlements due a leased employee, if the employee leasing company does not make such payments when due.  The commissioner may require such bond or deposit only if the commissioner finds, although not limited to such instances, that the leasing company has had its license suspended, denied, or limited in any other jurisdiction;  or that there have been instances where the leasing company has not paid employees' wages or benefits when due, or failed to make timely payment of any federal or state payroll taxes or unemployment compensation contributions when due.  Any bond or securities deposited under this paragraph shall not be included for the purpose of the calculation of working capital required by paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An employee leasing company shall submit to the commissioner, within 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter, a certification by an independent certified public accountant that for such quarter all applicable federal and state payroll taxes have been paid on a timely basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall to the extent practical permit by rule the acceptance of electronic filings in conformance with RSA 294-E.  Such rule may provide for the acceptance of electronic fillings and other assurance by an independent and qualified assurance organization approved by the commissioner that provides satisfactory assurance of compliance acceptable to the department of labor consistent with or instead of the requirements of this chapter or the rules adopted under it.  Such rule shall permit an employee leasing company to authorize an assurance organization approved by the commissioner to act on the employee leasing company's behalf in complying with the licensure requirements of this chapter, including the electronic filings of information and payment of fees.  Use of such an approved assurance organization is optional.  Nothing in this section shall limit the department's authority to license or terminate licensure of an employee leasing company or to investigate or enforce any provision of this chapter.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall issue a license as an employee leasing company to any person who qualifies for the license under the terms of this chapter.  The commissioner may, in addition, refuse to issue a license to any person or may suspend or revoke the license of any employee leasing company as provided in RSA 541-A, when the commissioner finds that the licensee or applicant has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, the rules adopted hereunder, or failed to pay federal withholding tax, unemployment insurance contributions, wages, or benefits when due.  If a license is revoked under this section, the commissioner may notify the appropriate client companies of such revocation, and shall notify the client companies of the penalties under RSA 277-B:12, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An application for license, or renewal, shall be rejected by the commissioner if it is found that any person named in the license application is not of good moral character, business integrity, or financial responsibility, or there is good and sufficient reason within the meaning and purpose of this chapter for rejecting the application for a license or renewal.

<codesect>
Licenses issued pursuant to this chapter shall remain in force for one year from the date of issue, unless the license has been revoked under RSA 277-B:7.  If an employee leasing company has been continuously licensed without revocation or suspension for a period of 5 years or more following the effective date of this section, a license shall remain in force for 2 years from the date of issue provided that financial information required under RSA 277-B:6 is submitted to the department on an annual basis.  Every licensee shall file an application for renewal 60 days before expiration of its license.  The commissioner shall act upon such application for renewal within such 60-day period.  In the event that an applicant for renewal shall qualify for a 2-year license, the licensing fee shall be twice the annual amount.
