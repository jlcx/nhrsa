I. Until an employee leasing company has been in business for a period of 2 years, including any time prior to October 1, 1994, a client company shall be jointly and severally liable with the employee leasing company for the payment of unemployment contributions as calculated under the provisions of RSA 277-B:9, VI.  The written disclosure provided under RSA 277-B:9, VI shall advise the client company of its joint and several liability, if any, under this section.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an employee leasing company is found by the commissioner, after a hearing, to have unjustifiably failed to pay any unemployment contributions when due, the commissioner shall require the employee leasing company to post a bond as a condition of continuing to conduct business in this state.  The bond shall be in such amount and upon such sureties as the commissioner shall determine to protect the interest of the affected employees and the state.  If the commissioner requires a bond under this section, the commissioner shall forthwith notify the appropriate authorities in any other state in which the employee leasing company is known to be conducting business, that the employee leasing company was subject to such action in this state.  The employee leasing company's license shall be suspended, if it does not post a bond required under this section within 5 working days of being ordered to post such bond.
