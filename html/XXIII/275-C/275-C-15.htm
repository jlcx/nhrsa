<center><h3>Section 275-C:15</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-C:15 Powers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The committee on architectural barrier-free design shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Conduct studies, hold hearings, administer oaths, issue subpoenas, publish reports, and recommend legislation to implement this subdivision;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Receive, process, and review complaints from any person alleging a violation of the code;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Issue cease-and-desist orders that enjoin an owner, an owner's agent, or a lessee-in-possession from further construction or use of buildings and facilities, until compliance with the code for barrier-free design.  To compel obedience to such orders, the committee on architectural barrier-free design shall petition the superior court for the county in which the party sought to be enjoined is principally located.  Upon satisfying itself that the order of the committee was within its jurisdiction to issue and that there is substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole to support the finding of the committee, the superior court shall issue its order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except as provided in paragraph V, grant waivers to an owner, an owner's agent or a lessee-in-possession, pertaining only to places of public accommodation provided for in RSA 155:39-a, from specific requirements of the code for barrier-free design where, upon a clear and convincing showing, a compelling public interest is deemed to outweigh the state's interest in removing architectural barriers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. With respect to construction projects subject to the provisions of RSA 155:39-d, grant waivers to an owner, an owner's agent or a lessee-in-possession from specific requirements of the code for barrier-free design upon good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Charge a nonrefundable fee for any application for waiver request submitted under paragraph IV or V, which shall be payable to the governor's commission on disability.  Each application for waiver request shall contain no more than 2 items to be reviewed for waiver.  All fees shall be paid in advance with the application for waiver request.  Any building or facility, as defined in RSA 275-C:10 II, shall not be subject to an application fee but shall file an application for waiver request as provided in this section.
