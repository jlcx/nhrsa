&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 273-A:3 Obligation to Bargain. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the obligation of the public employer and the employee organization certified by the board as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit to negotiate in good faith.  "Good faith'' negotiation involves meeting at reasonable times and places in an effort to reach agreement on the terms of employment, and to cooperate in mediation and fact-finding required by this chapter, but the obligation to negotiate in good faith shall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Any party desiring to bargain shall serve written notice of its intention on the other party at least 120 days before the budget submission date;  provided, however, that bargaining with state employees shall commence not later than 120 days before the deadline for submission of the governor's proposed operating budget.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Only cost items shall be submitted to the legislative body of the public employer for approval at the next annual meeting of the legislative body, unless there is an emergency as defined in RSA 31:5 or RSA 197:3.  If the legislative body rejects the submission, or while accepting the submission takes any action which would result in a modification of the terms of the cost item submitted to it, either party may reopen negotiations on the entire agreement.  No cost item agreed to by the public employer and the employee organization shall be modified by the legislative body of such public employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the public employer is a local political subdivision with a city or town council form of government cost items shall be submitted within 30 days to the city council or aldermen or to the town council for approval.  Within 30 days of the receipt of the submission, the city council, aldermen, or the town council shall vote to accept or reject the cost items.  If the city council or aldermen or the town council rejects any part of the submission, or while accepting the submission takes any action which would result in a modification of the terms of the cost item submitted to it, either party may reopen negotiations on all or part of the entire agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Matters regarding the policies and practice of any merit system established by statute, charter or ordinance relating to recruitment, examination, appointment and advancement under conditions of political neutrality and based upon principles of merit and competence shall not be subjects of bargaining under the provisions of this chapter.  Nothing herein shall be construed to diminish the authority of the state personnel commission or any board or agency established by statute, charter or ordinance to conduct and grade merit examinations from which appointments or promotions may be made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Each public employer shall record its budget submission date with the board.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 273-A:4 Grievance Procedures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every agreement negotiated under the terms of this chapter shall be reduced to writing and shall contain workable grievance procedures.  No grievance resulting from the failure of a teacher to be renewed pursuant to RSA 189:14-a shall be subject to arbitration or any other binding resolution, except as provided by RSA 189:14-a and RSA 189:14-b.  Any such provision in force as of the effective date of this section shall be null and void upon the expiration date of that collective bargaining agreement.  However, after the expiration date of that collective bargaining agreement, nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the school district public employer and the exclusive bargaining representative from entering into a subsequent agreement that may include arbitration or any other binding resolution for teacher nonrenewals pursuant to RSA 189:14-a and RSA 189:14-b.  If such grievance procedures become incorporated into a subsequent collective bargaining agreement, those procedures shall become null and void at the expiration of that agreement.  "Grievance resulting from failure of a teacher to be renewed'' means a grievance that challenges nonrenewal, or that seeks reversal or reinstatement from nonrenewal as a remedy.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall have primary jurisdiction of all violations of RSA 273-A:5, but no complaint may be filed with the board for violation of RSA 273-A:5, I(c) or (d) until the complainant has exhausted the administrative remedies provided by statutes other than this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 273-A:8 Determining Bargaining Unit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board or its designee shall determine the appropriate bargaining unit and shall certify the exclusive representative thereof when petitioned to do so under RSA 273-A:10.  In making its determination the board should take into consideration the principle of community of interest.  The community of interest may be exhibited by one or more of the following criteria, although it is not limited to such:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Employees with the same conditions of employment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Employees with a history of workable and acceptable collective negotiations;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Employees in the same historic craft or profession;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Employees functioning within the same organizational unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In no case shall the board certify a bargaining unit of fewer than 10 employees with the same community of interest.  For purposes of this section, probationary employees shall be counted to satisfy the employee minimum number requirement.  In no case shall such probationary employees vote in any election conducted under the provisions of this chapter to certify an employee organization as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may certify a bargaining unit composed of professional and non-professional employees only if both the professional and non-professional employees, voting separately, vote to join the proposed bargaining unit.  Persons exercising supervisory authority involving the significant exercise of discretion may not belong to the same bargaining unit as the employees they supervise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event the bargaining unit is determined by the board's designee, the decision may be appealed to the board for final determination.

Upon so finding, the board shall order an election to be held under its supervision and in accordance with rules prescribed by the board.  Otherwise, it shall dismiss the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The petition shall consist of separate forms for each employee, whose names shall not be disclosed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The ballot shall contain a space permitting a vote against representation by any employee organization whatever;  and no election shall be held within 12 months after an election in which a majority of those voting cast ballots against representation by any employee organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An employee organization receiving a simple majority of the votes cast shall be certified by the board as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit.  In the absence of a simple majority, a run-off election shall be conducted between the 2 options receiving the most votes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall not certify any employee organization as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit without an election being held pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Certification as exclusive representative shall remain valid until the employee organization is dissolved, voluntarily surrenders certification, loses a valid election or is decertified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board shall decertify any employee organization which is found in a judicial proceeding to discriminate with regard to membership, or with regard to the conditions thereof, because of age, sex, race, color, creed, marital status or national origin;  or has systematically failed to allow its membership equal participation in the affairs of the employee organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any challenge to a certified exclusive bargaining representative, whether in a decertification election or a challenge by another labor organization, shall result in decertification or change in bargaining representation if decertification or the challenging organization is approved by a majority vote of members of the bargaining unit voting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Two or more bargaining units may with the approval of the public employer affected combine for the purpose of engaging in collective bargaining negotiations with a single public employer and the bargaining unit thus created shall enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same duties as if a single exclusive representative for the combined bargaining unit had been certified by the board.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Public employers shall extend the following rights to the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit certified under RSA 273-A:8:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The right to represent employees in collective bargaining negotiations and in the settlement of grievances.  An individual employee may present an oral grievance to his employer without the intervention of the exclusive representative.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The right to represent the bargaining unit exclusively and without challenge during the term of the collective bargaining agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an election may be held not more than 180 nor less than 120 days prior to the budget submission date in the year such collective bargaining agreement shall expire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A reasonable number of employees who act as representatives of the bargaining unit shall be given a reasonable opportunity to meet with the employer or his representatives during working hours without loss of compensation or benefits.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 273-A:12 Resolution of Disputes. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Whenever the parties request the board's assistance or have bargained to impasse, or if the parties have not reached agreement on a contract within 60 days, or in the case of state employees 90 days, prior to the budget submission date, and if not otherwise governed by ground rules:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The chief negotiator for the bargaining unit may request to make a presentation directly to the board of the public employer.  If this request is approved by the board of the public employer, the chief negotiator for the board of the public employer shall in turn have the right to make a presentation directly to the bargaining unit.  The cost of the respective presentations shall be borne by the party making the presentation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The chief negotiator for the board of the public employer may request to make a presentation directly to the bargaining unit.  If this request is approved by the bargaining unit, the chief negotiator for the bargaining unit shall in turn have the right to make a presentation directly to the board of the public employer.  The cost of the respective presentations shall be borne by the party making the presentation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the impasse is not resolved, a neutral party chosen by the parties, or failing agreement, appointed by the board, shall undertake to mediate the issues remaining in dispute.  If the parties so choose, or if mediation does not result in agreement within 45 days, or in the case of state employees 75 days, prior to the budget submission date, a neutral party chosen by the parties, or failing agreement, appointed by the board, shall make and report findings of fact together with recommendations for resolving each of the issues remaining in dispute, which findings and recommendations shall not be made public until the negotiating teams shall have considered them for 10 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If either negotiating team rejects the neutral party's recommendations, his findings and recommendations shall be submitted to the full membership of the employee organization and to the board of the public employer, which shall vote to accept or reject so much of his recommendations as is otherwise permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) If either the full membership of the employee organization or the board of the public employer rejects the neutral party's recommendations, the findings and recommendations shall be submitted to the legislative body of the public employer at the next annual meeting of the legislative body, unless there is an emergency as defined in RSA 31:5 or RSA 197:3, which shall vote to accept or reject so much of the recommendations as otherwise is permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the public employer is a local political subdivision with a city or town council form of government and if either the full membership of the employee organization or the board of the public employer rejects the neutral party's recommendations, the findings and recommendations shall be submitted within 30 days to the city council or aldermen or town council for approval.  Within 30 days of the receipt of the submission, the city council or aldermen or town council shall vote to accept or reject the recommendations as otherwise is permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the impasse is not resolved following the action of the legislative body, negotiations shall be reopened.  Mediation may be requested by either party and may, at the mediator's option, involve the board of the public employer.  In cases where the board of the public employer also serves as the legislative body of a municipality, the mediator may request no more than one less than a quorum of the legislative body to participate in the mediation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the parties from providing for such lawful procedures for resolving impasses as the parties may agree upon;  providing that no such procedures shall bind the legislative body on matters regarding cost items.  The parties shall share equally all fees and costs of such procedures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The parties shall share equally all fees and costs of mediation and fact-finding required by this chapter.
