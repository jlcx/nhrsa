<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Whenever the parties request the board's assistance or have bargained to impasse, or if the parties have not reached agreement on a contract within 60 days, or in the case of state employees 90 days, prior to the budget submission date, and if not otherwise governed by ground rules:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The chief negotiator for the bargaining unit may request to make a presentation directly to the board of the public employer.  If this request is approved by the board of the public employer, the chief negotiator for the board of the public employer shall in turn have the right to make a presentation directly to the bargaining unit.  The cost of the respective presentations shall be borne by the party making the presentation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The chief negotiator for the board of the public employer may request to make a presentation directly to the bargaining unit.  If this request is approved by the bargaining unit, the chief negotiator for the bargaining unit shall in turn have the right to make a presentation directly to the board of the public employer.  The cost of the respective presentations shall be borne by the party making the presentation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the impasse is not resolved, a neutral party chosen by the parties, or failing agreement, appointed by the board, shall undertake to mediate the issues remaining in dispute.  If the parties so choose, or if mediation does not result in agreement within 45 days, or in the case of state employees 75 days, prior to the budget submission date, a neutral party chosen by the parties, or failing agreement, appointed by the board, shall make and report findings of fact together with recommendations for resolving each of the issues remaining in dispute, which findings and recommendations shall not be made public until the negotiating teams shall have considered them for 10 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If either negotiating team rejects the neutral party's recommendations, his findings and recommendations shall be submitted to the full membership of the employee organization and to the board of the public employer, which shall vote to accept or reject so much of his recommendations as is otherwise permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) If either the full membership of the employee organization or the board of the public employer rejects the neutral party's recommendations, the findings and recommendations shall be submitted to the legislative body of the public employer at the next annual meeting of the legislative body, unless there is an emergency as defined in RSA 31:5 or RSA 197:3, which shall vote to accept or reject so much of the recommendations as otherwise is permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the public employer is a local political subdivision with a city or town council form of government and if either the full membership of the employee organization or the board of the public employer rejects the neutral party's recommendations, the findings and recommendations shall be submitted within 30 days to the city council or aldermen or town council for approval.  Within 30 days of the receipt of the submission, the city council or aldermen or town council shall vote to accept or reject the recommendations as otherwise is permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the impasse is not resolved following the action of the legislative body, negotiations shall be reopened.  Mediation may be requested by either party and may, at the mediator's option, involve the board of the public employer.  In cases where the board of the public employer also serves as the legislative body of a municipality, the mediator may request no more than one less than a quorum of the legislative body to participate in the mediation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the parties from providing for such lawful procedures for resolving impasses as the parties may agree upon;  providing that no such procedures shall bind the legislative body on matters regarding cost items.  The parties shall share equally all fees and costs of such procedures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The parties shall share equally all fees and costs of mediation and fact-finding required by this chapter.
