None of the employer's costs associated with a payroll card or payroll card account shall be passed on to the employee;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) With checks on a financial institution convenient to the place of employment where suitable arrangements are made for the cashing of such checks by employees for the full amount of the wages due;  provided, however, that if an employer elects to pay employees as specified in subparagraphs (b), (c), or (d), the employer shall offer employees the option of being paid as specified in subparagraph (e), and further provided that all wages in the nature of health and welfare fund or pension fund contributions required pursuant to a health and welfare fund trust agreement, pension fund trust agreement, collective bargaining agreement, or other agreement adopted for the benefit of employees and agreed to by the employer shall be paid by every such employer within 30 days of the date of demand for such payment, the payment to be made to the administrator or other designated official of the applicable health and welfare or pension trust fund.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. If an employer offers its employees the option of receiving wages by a payroll card, the employer shall:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Provide to the employee written disclosure in plain language of all the employee's wage payment options.  The written disclosure shall state the terms and conditions of the payroll card account option, including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in this section and a complete itemized list of all known fees that may be deducted from the employee's payroll card account by the employer or card issuer.  The disclosure shall also state whether third parties may assess transaction fees in addition to the fees assessed by the employee's payroll card issuer or issuers.

The labor commissioner shall notify the prime or general contractor within 15 days from the date of receipt of such notice that such contributions are overdue.  The department of labor may pursue the general or prime contractor for such contributions only after all reasonable efforts have been made to secure the contributions from the subcontractor.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. The commissioner may, upon written petition showing good and sufficient reason, permit payment of wages less frequently than weekly, except that it shall be at least once each calendar month.  In all instances, payment shall be made regularly on a predesignated date.  The commissioner may prescribe the terms and conditions of such permission, and limit the duration thereof.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV-a. (a) The commissioner may permit payment of wages less frequently than weekly where a school district collective bargaining agreement for hourly employees provides an option to be paid in any number of equal installments with one additional installment.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) Such additional installment shall require a full reconciliation of pay at least once each calendar year.  Each employee shall be informed in writing, prior to choosing the equal payment option, that the reconciliation could result in a paycheck of less than the equal pay amount to a possible zero balance due the employee.  In all instances, payment shall be made regularly on a predesignated date.  The commissioner may prescribe the terms and conditions of such permission, and limit the duration thereof.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Any employee may exclude himself or herself from participation in the provisions of this paragraph.  If the employee chooses this option, the employee shall notify the school district in writing prior to the first pay check.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV.

Mere inconvenience to the employer is an insufficient basis for denial of a request for compensatory time off.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) The employer shall not have a policy of requiring the use of compensatory time within a certain period or else the employee will lose it.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3) Upon termination of employment for any reason, an employee shall be paid for unused compensatory time at the final regular rate received by such employee.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c)(1) Limitations concerning the ceiling of accrual of compensatory time are as follows:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(A) Public safety, emergency response, or seasonal activity employees may accrue no more than 480 hours of compensatory time for 320 actual overtime hours worked.

These periods of short but intense activity shall not qualify as seasonal.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) Nothing in this paragraph modifies or affects any federal law regarding compensatory time off including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. section 207.  The purpose of this paragraph is to make compensatory time off available as set forth above under New Hampshire law and not to limit already existing rights and protection.  An employer shall provide compensatory time off under whichever statutory provision provides greater rights to employees.">
