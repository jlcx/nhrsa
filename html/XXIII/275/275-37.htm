&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275:37 Equal Pay. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No employer shall discriminate in the payment of wages as between the sexes, or shall pay any employee in his or her employ salary or wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex for equal work or work on the same operations.  However, nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit a variation in rates of pay based upon a marked difference in seniority, experience, training, skill, ability, or difference in duties and services performed, either regularly or occasionally, or difference in the shift or time of the day worked, or difference in availability for other operation, or other reasonable differentiation except difference in sex.  A variation in rates of pay as between the sexes is not prohibited where such variation is provided by contract between the employer and the recognized bargaining agent of the employees or, in case there is no such bargaining agent, where such variation is provided by written agreement or contract between the employer and not less than 5 of the employees.
