II. If an employer making a deduction of an employee's wages under paragraph I fails to make any payment relative to such deduction on the employee's behalf, and such employee loses any benefit or fails to meet an obligation caused by such failure, the employer shall be liable for such lost benefit or failed obligation.  For any benefits provided to an employee paid for entirely by the employer without employee deductions, if the employer fails to make timely payments for such benefits and the employee loses any benefit or fails to meet any obligations caused by such failure, then the employer shall be liable for such lost benefits or failed obligations.  The employer shall also be liable for any cost incurred by the employee caused by the employer's failure to make such payments.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An insurer or plan administrator of a self-funded plan shall notify an employee in writing of termination of an employee benefit plan pursuant to the notification requirements of RSA 415:18, XVI or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as applicable.

IV. If a plan administrator fails to comply with the applicable employee notification requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, then the plan administrator shall be liable for lost benefits or failed obligations to the employee resulting from the termination of the employee's benefit plan.  Such liability extends only for the period of noncompliance beginning on the date notification to the employee was required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and ending on the date proper notification was made.  Such liability for plan administrators is secondary to the employer's liability during this period and becomes primary only after the department of labor determines that the employer is financially unable to pay all or any part of the employee's lost benefits and failed obligations.  Such liability for plan administrators in no way diminishes the employer's liability during this or any period.
