<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person has control over the time when the work is performed, and the time of performance is not dictated by the employer.  However, this shall not prohibit the employer from reaching an agreement with the person as to completion schedule, range of work hours, and maximum number of work hours to be provided by the person, and in the case of entertainment, the time such entertainment is to be presented.
