&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275:41-a Procedures for Hearings and Appeals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In a claim under RSA 275:37, the commissioner shall notify the employer by serving a copy of such claim and an order to file with the commissioner within 30 days from the receipt of such notice any objections to such claim specifying the grounds therefor.  Service may be by certified mail with return receipt.  If objection is not made within 30 days, the commissioner may order that payment be made in accordance with the claim.  If requested, a hearing shall be afforded at which time any party may appear, with counsel if desired, and present evidence and cross examine opposing witnesses.  Any party, at the party's own expense, may cause a record to be made of the hearing.  A written decision shall be made within 30 days after the hearing stating the decision and specifying the facts and conclusions upon which the decision is based.  If wages are found to be due, an order for payment shall be issued.  Any party aggrieved by the decision may appeal to the superior court not later than 20 days thereof by petition, setting forth that the decision is erroneous, in whole or in part, and specifying the grounds upon which the decision is claimed to be in error.  Upon the filing of an appeal, the commissioner shall transfer to the court the record of the proceeding or a certified copy thereof.  The scope of review by the superior court shall be limited to questions of law.  After hearing and upon consideration of the record, the court may affirm, vacate, or modify in whole or in part the decision of the commissioner, or may remand the matter to the commissioner for further findings.  In the absence of a timely appeal, the decision and order shall be final, shall be entered upon the docket of the superior court at the request of the prevailing party, may be enforced as judgment of said court, and shall be a lien upon the property of the employer situated in the state for a period of 3 years from the time of the decision.  It is a requirement of this subdivision for purposes of RSA 275:37 that a final order be immediately satisfied by the employer.
