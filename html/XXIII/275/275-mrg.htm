<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Employee'' means and includes every person who may be permitted, required, or directed by any employer, in consideration of direct or indirect gain or profit, to engage in any employment, but shall not include any person exempted from the definition of employee as stated in RSA 281-A:2, VI(b)(2), (3), or (4), or RSA 281-A:2, VII(b), or a person providing services as part of a residential placement for individuals with developmental, acquired, or emotional disabilities, or any person who meets all of the following criteria:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person has control and discretion over the means and manner of performance of the work, in that the result of the work, rather than the means or manner by which the work is performed, is the primary element bargained for by the employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person has control over the time when the work is performed, and the time of performance is not dictated by the employer.  However, this shall not prohibit the employer from reaching an agreement with the person as to completion schedule, range of work hours, and maximum number of work hours to be provided by the person, and in the case of entertainment, the time such entertainment is to be presented.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The person hires and pays the person's assistants, if any, and to the extent such assistants are employees, supervises the details of the assistants' work.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The term "wages'' means compensation, including hourly health and welfare, and pension fund contributions required pursuant to a health and welfare trust agreement, pension fund trust agreement, collective bargaining agreement, or other agreement adopted for the benefit of an employee and agreed to by his employer, for labor or services rendered by an employee, whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece, commission, or other basis of calculation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The term "commissioner'' means the labor commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For the purposes of this subdivision the officers of a corporation and any agents having the management of such corporation who knowingly permit the corporation to violate the provisions of RSA 275:43, 44 shall be deemed to be the employers of the employees of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The term "salaried employee'' means any employee who under an employment agreement or as a matter of policy or practice, regularly receives each pay period a predetermined or fixed amount of money constituting compensation, based on a predetermined amount of wages to be paid as determined by a daily rate, weekly rate, bi-weekly rate, semi-monthly rate or monthly rate, and which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed and regardless of the hours or days worked except as otherwise provided in RSA 275:43-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The term "draw against commission'' means a compensation method under which an employee receives, at least once each month, a draw payment of not less than the minimum wage, representing an advance against anticipated commission earnings.  Draws shall be reconciled against commissions monthly unless otherwise agreed, in writing, by employer and employee.  If the reconciliation results in an amount payable to the employee, payment shall be made in accordance with this chapter.  If the reconciliation results in a negative balance, the balance may, by written agreement between employer and employee, be carried over into ensuing time periods;  however, if a final reconciliation results in a negative balance, it shall not be recoverable from the employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Payroll card'' means an access device issued and accepted by a financial institution to access funds from the employee's payroll card account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. "Payroll card account'' means an account directly or indirectly established by an employer on behalf of an employee to which electronic fund transfers of the employee's wages, salary, or other employee compensation are made on a recurring basis.  A payroll card account does not include a savings account or a demand deposit account at a financial institution and shall be subject to Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. part 205.  Disclosures, periodic statements, or alternatives to periodic statements;  notices;  error resolution procedures;  and limitations on liability, with respect to payroll cards, shall be in accordance with the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1693 et seq., and its implementing regulation, Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. part 205.

<center><h3>Section 275:43</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275:43 Weekly. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every employer shall pay all wages due to employees within 8 days including Sunday after expiration of the week in which the work is performed, except when permitted to pay wages less frequently as authorized by the commissioner pursuant to paragraph II, on regular paydays designated in advance by the employer and at no cost to the employee:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In lawful money of the United States;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) By electronic fund transfer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) By direct deposit with written authorization of the employee to banks of the employee's choice;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) By a payroll card provided that the employer shall provide to the employee at least one free means to withdraw up to and including the full amount of the employee balance in the employee's payroll card or payroll card account during each pay period at a financial institution or other location convenient to the place of employment.  None of the employer's costs associated with a payroll card or payroll card account shall be passed on to the employee;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) With checks on a financial institution convenient to the place of employment where suitable arrangements are made for the cashing of such checks by employees for the full amount of the wages due;  provided, however, that if an employer elects to pay employees as specified in subparagraphs (b), (c), or (d), the employer shall offer employees the option of being paid as specified in subparagraph (e), and further provided that all wages in the nature of health and welfare fund or pension fund contributions required pursuant to a health and welfare fund trust agreement, pension fund trust agreement, collective bargaining agreement, or other agreement adopted for the benefit of employees and agreed to by the employer shall be paid by every such employer within 30 days of the date of demand for such payment, the payment to be made to the administrator or other designated official of the applicable health and welfare or pension trust fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an employer offers its employees the option of receiving wages by a payroll card, the employer shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide to the employee written disclosure in plain language of all the employee's wage payment options.  The written disclosure shall state the terms and conditions of the payroll card account option, including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in this section and a complete itemized list of all known fees that may be deducted from the employee's payroll card account by the employer or card issuer.  The disclosure shall also state whether third parties may assess transaction fees in addition to the fees assessed by the employee's payroll card issuer or issuers.  In no event shall the employer provide payment of wages to a payroll card that has an expiration date, unless the employer agrees to provide a replacement payroll card before the expiration date at no cost to the employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Initiate payment of wages to an employee by electronic fund transfer to a payroll card account only after the employee has voluntarily consented in writing to that method of payment.  Consent to payment of wages by electronic fund transfer to a payroll card account shall not be a condition of hire or of continued employment.  The written consent signed by the employee shall include the terms and conditions of the payroll card account option.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide written notice of any change to any of the terms and conditions of the payroll card or payroll card account, including but not limited to an itemized list of all fees that may have changed, and obtain written assent from the employee that the employee voluntarily consents to receive wages to a payroll card or payroll card account subject to the changes.  The employer shall be responsible for any increase in fees charged to the employee before the employer provides written notice of such changes to the employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Provide the employee the option to discontinue receipt of wages by a payroll card or payroll card account at any time, without penalty to the employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a subcontractor who is responsible for making health and welfare fund or pension fund contributions fails to make such contributions within the 30-day requirement of paragraph I, the person designated to receive such contributions shall, within 15 days of the date the contributions became due, notify in writing the labor commissioner that the contributions are overdue.  The labor commissioner shall notify the prime or general contractor within 15 days from the date of receipt of such notice that such contributions are overdue.  The department of labor may pursue the general or prime contractor for such contributions only after all reasonable efforts have been made to secure the contributions from the subcontractor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may, upon written petition showing good and sufficient reason, permit payment of wages less frequently than weekly, except that it shall be at least once each calendar month.  In all instances, payment shall be made regularly on a predesignated date.  The commissioner may prescribe the terms and conditions of such permission, and limit the duration thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. (a) The commissioner may permit payment of wages less frequently than weekly where a school district collective bargaining agreement for hourly employees provides an option to be paid in any number of equal installments with one additional installment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such additional installment shall require a full reconciliation of pay at least once each calendar year.  Each employee shall be informed in writing, prior to choosing the equal payment option, that the reconciliation could result in a paycheck of less than the equal pay amount to a possible zero balance due the employee.  In all instances, payment shall be made regularly on a predesignated date.  The commissioner may prescribe the terms and conditions of such permission, and limit the duration thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any employee may exclude himself or herself from participation in the provisions of this paragraph.  If the employee chooses this option, the employee shall notify the school district in writing prior to the first pay check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Vacation pay, severance pay, personal days, holiday pay, sick pay, and payment of employee expenses, when such benefits are a matter of employment practice or policy, or both, shall be considered wages pursuant to RSA 275:42, III, when due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Nothing in this section shall prevent an employer from compensating an employee on a draw against commission basis as defined in RSA 275:42, VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. This section shall not be construed to preclude the use of compensatory time off as compensation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) This paragraph applies to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Governmental entities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Public sector employees who are under a collective bargaining employment agreement or, if not negotiated through a union or other designated employee representatives, that the agreement or understanding must be reached between employer and employee before the performance of any work.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) When the employee requests the use of accrued compensatory time, the request shall be honored within a reasonable period of time unless to do so would unduly disrupt the operation of the employing agency.  Mere inconvenience to the employer is an insufficient basis for denial of a request for compensatory time off.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The employer shall not have a policy of requiring the use of compensatory time within a certain period or else the employee will lose it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Upon termination of employment for any reason, an employee shall be paid for unused compensatory time at the final regular rate received by such employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c)(1) Limitations concerning the ceiling of accrual of compensatory time are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Public safety, emergency response, or seasonal activity employees may accrue no more than 480 hours of compensatory time for 320 actual overtime hours worked.  This limitation shall not apply to office personnel or civilian employees who may perform public safety activities on an emergency basis, even if such employees spend substantially all of their time in a particular work week engaged in such activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Other public sector employees may accrue no more than 240 hours of compensatory time for 160 hours of actual time worked.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If an employee has accrued more than the applicable ceiling for compensatory time, such employee shall be paid overtime pay at time and one half of the employee's regular rate of pay on the designated pay day.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For the purposes of this paragraph:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Governmental entity'' means any branch, department, commission, bureau, agency, or agent of the government of this state or a political subdivision of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Public safety activities'' includes law enforcement, firefighting, or related duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Emergency response activities'' includes dispatching of emergency vehicles and personnel, rescue work, and ambulance services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) "Seasonal activity'' includes duties performed by employees assigned to work during periods of significantly increased demands on a regular and recurring basis and during this period protected overtime may result in the accumulation of more than 240 compensatory time hours.  These periods of short but intense activity shall not qualify as seasonal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nothing in this paragraph modifies or affects any federal law regarding compensatory time off including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. section 207.  The purpose of this paragraph is to make compensatory time off available as set forth above under New Hampshire law and not to limit already existing rights and protection.  An employer shall provide compensatory time off under whichever statutory provision provides greater rights to employees.

Such liability for plan administrators is secondary to the employer's liability during this period and becomes primary only after the department of labor determines that the employer is financially unable to pay all or any part of the employee's lost benefits and failed obligations.  Such liability for plan administrators in no way diminishes the employer's liability during this or any period.
