&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 273-C:4 Obligation to Bargain. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the obligation of the employer and the employee organization certified by the board as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit to negotiate in good faith.  "Good faith'' negotiation involves meeting at reasonable times and places in an effort to reach agreement on the terms of employment, but the obligation to negotiate in good faith shall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession.
