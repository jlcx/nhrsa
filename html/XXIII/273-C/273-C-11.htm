&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 273-C:11 Representation Rights of the Bargaining Unit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Employers shall extend the following rights to the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit certified under RSA 273-C:10 or as set forth in RSA 273-C:9, IV:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The right to represent employees in collective bargaining negotiations and in the settlement of grievances.  An individual employee may present an oral grievance to his employer without the intervention of the exclusive representative.  Until the grievance is reduced to writing, the exclusive representative shall be excluded from a hearing if the employee so requests;  but any resolution of the grievance shall not be inconsistent with the terms of an existing agreement between the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The right to represent the bargaining unit exclusively and without challenge during the term of the collective bargaining agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an election may be held not more than 180 nor less than 120 days prior to the date on which the term of the collective bargaining agreement expires.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A reasonable number of employees who act as representatives of the bargaining unit shall be given a reasonable opportunity to meet with the employer or his representatives during working hours without loss of compensation or benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The exclusive representative of a bargaining unit acting as such on the effective date of this section shall be deemed certified by the board in accordance with RSA 273-C:9, IV and shall have all the rights established in RSA 273-C:11, I.
