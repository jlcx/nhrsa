<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In making its determination the board should take into consideration the principle of community of interest.  The community of interest may be exhibited by one or more of the following criteria, although it is not limited to such:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Employees with the same conditions of employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(d) Employees functioning within the same organizational unit.
<br>

Persons exercising supervisory authority involving the significant exercise of discretion may not belong to the same bargaining unit as the employees they supervise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event the bargaining unit is determined by the board's designee, the decision may be appealed to the board for final determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 273-C:10 Elections. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a petition is filed by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit seeking recognition, alleging that they wish to be represented in collective bargaining by an employee organization as their exclusive representative or asserting that the employee organization which has been certified by the board is no longer the representative of the majority of employees in the bargaining unit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An employer alleging that one or more employee organizations has petitioned to be recognized as the exclusive representative of a majority of employees in a bargaining unit;
<br>
the board shall investigate such petition and may hold hearings for the purpose of determining whether or not grounds exist for conducting an election.  Upon so finding, the board shall order an election to be held under its supervision and in accordance with rules adopted by the board under RSA 273-C:12.  Otherwise, it shall dismiss the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The petition shall consist of separate forms for each employee, whose names shall not be disclosed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The ballot shall contain a space permitting a vote against representation by any employee organization whatever;  and no election shall be held within 12 months after an election in which a majority of those voting cast ballots against representation by any employee organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An employee organization receiving a simple majority of the votes cast shall be certified by the board as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit.  In the absence of a simple majority, a run-off election shall be conducted between the 2 options receiving the most votes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall not certify any employee organization as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit without an election being held pursuant to this section, except as provided in RSA 273-C:9, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Certification as exclusive representative shall remain valid until the employee organization is dissolved, voluntarily surrenders certification, loses a valid election or is decertified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board shall decertify any employee organization which is found in a judicial proceeding to discriminate with regard to membership, or with regard to the conditions thereof, because of age, sex, race, color, creed, marital status or national origin;  or has systematically failed to allow its membership equal participation in the affairs of the employee organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any challenge to a certified exclusive bargaining representative, whether in a decertification election or a challenge by another labor organization, shall result in decertification or change in bargaining representation if decertification or the challenging organization is approved by a majority vote of members of the bargaining unit voting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Two or more bargaining units may, with the approval of the affected employer, combine for the purpose of engaging in collective bargaining negotiations with a single employer and the bargaining unit thus created shall enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same duties as if a single exclusive representative for the combined bargaining unit had been certified by the board.

I. Employers shall extend the following rights to the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit certified under RSA 273-C:10 or as set forth in RSA 273-C:9, IV:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The right to represent employees in collective bargaining negotiations and in the settlement of grievances.  An individual employee may present an oral grievance to his employer without the intervention of the exclusive representative.  Until the grievance is reduced to writing, the exclusive representative shall be excluded from a hearing if the employee so requests;  but any resolution of the grievance shall not be inconsistent with the terms of an existing agreement between the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The right to represent the bargaining unit exclusively and without challenge during the term of the collective bargaining agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an election may be held not more than 180 nor less than 120 days prior to the date on which the term of the collective bargaining agreement expires.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A reasonable number of employees who act as representatives of the bargaining unit shall be given a reasonable opportunity to meet with the employer or his representatives during working hours without loss of compensation or benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The exclusive representative of a bargaining unit acting as such on the effective date of this section shall be deemed certified by the board in accordance with RSA 273-C:9, IV and shall have all the rights established in RSA 273-C:11, I.
