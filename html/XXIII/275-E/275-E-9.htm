&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-E:9 Protection of Public Employees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No governmental entity shall threaten, discipline, demote, fire, transfer, reassign, or discriminate against a public employee who files a complaint with the department of labor under RSA 275-E:8 or otherwise discloses or threatens to disclose activities or information that the employee reasonably believes violates RSA 275-E:2, represents a gross mismanagement or waste of public funds, property, or manpower, or evidences an abuse of authority or a danger to the public health and safety.  Notwithstanding this provision of law, public employers may discipline, demote, fire, transfer, or reassign an employee so long as the action is not arbitrary or capricious and is not in retaliation for the filing of a complaint under this chapter.  Any public employee who files such a complaint or makes such a disclosure shall be entitled to all rights and remedies provided by this chapter.
