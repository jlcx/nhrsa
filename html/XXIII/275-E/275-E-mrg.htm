<center><h3>Section 275-E:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-E:8 Complaint Investigation by Department of Labor. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of labor shall have the authority to receive and investigate complaints or information from any public employee concerning the possible existence of any activity constituting fraud, waste, or abuse in the expenditure of any public funds, whether state or local, or relating to programs and operations involving the procurement of any supplies, services, or construction by governmental entities within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The labor commissioner shall make an initial determination as to whether a complaint received under paragraph I is without merit, unfounded, or in need of further information, in which case, the complaint may be dismissed without further action, or held until such time as additional information is received, or dismissed if no further information is received within the time period specified by the commissioner.  If the labor commissioner makes an initial determination that the complaint has merit and warrants further investigation, the labor commissioner may undertake such investigation or refer the matter to the appropriate enforcement authority.  The identity of the person who filed the complaint shall not be disclosed without his or her written consent, unless such disclosure is to a law enforcement agency that is conducting a criminal investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the labor commissioner undertakes further investigation of the complaint, the commissioner shall have access to all records, confidential or otherwise, reports, audits, reviews, papers, books, documents, recommendations, and correspondence, including information or data that is deemed necessary by the commissioner to carry out the investigation.  The labor commissioner may request such information, cooperation, and assistance from any state, county, or local governmental agency and may coordinate activities with the attorney general's office.  In carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities, the labor commissioner shall immediately report to the attorney general and either the United States Attorney or local enforcement agency any suspected violation of state or federal criminal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No governmental entity shall take any retaliatory action against a public employee who, in good faith, files a complaint under this section and the public employee shall be afforded all protections under RSA 275-E:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The labor commissioner shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A relative to the complaint investigation process established in this section, including the administrative procedure used for responding to complaints, gathering additional information, and rendering decisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 275-E:9 Protection of Public Employees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No governmental entity shall threaten, discipline, demote, fire, transfer, reassign, or discriminate against a public employee who files a complaint with the department of labor under RSA 275-E:8 or otherwise discloses or threatens to disclose activities or information that the employee reasonably believes violates RSA 275-E:2, represents a gross mismanagement or waste of public funds, property, or manpower, or evidences an abuse of authority or a danger to the public health and safety.  Notwithstanding this provision of law, public employers may discipline, demote, fire, transfer, or reassign an employee so long as the action is not arbitrary or capricious and is not in retaliation for the filing of a complaint under this chapter.  Any public employee who files such a complaint or makes such a disclosure shall be entitled to all rights and remedies provided by this chapter.
