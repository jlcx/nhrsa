&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:70 Payment of Contributions by State. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The liability of this state including the state university system for benefits paid shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In lieu of contributions required of other employers subject to this chapter, the state shall pay into the unemployment compensation fund an amount equivalent to the amount of benefits, including extended benefits, paid to claimants who during the applicable period were paid wages by this state.  If a claimant during such base period was employed by this state and by other employers subject to the provisions of this chapter, the amount to be paid into the unemployment compensation fund by this state with respect to such claimant shall be prorated pursuant to RSA 282-A:72.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amount of payments required under this subdivision to be made into the fund shall be ascertained by the commissioner of the department of employment security as soon as practicable after the end of each calendar month and shall, except as provided hereafter, be paid by the commissioner of administrative services from funds appropriated therefor;  provided that, if said appropriation is not sufficient to make all such payments or no appropriation is made therefor, they shall, upon warrant by the governor, be paid from the general funds of the state, out of any money not otherwise appropriated.  If a claimant to whom benefits were paid was paid wages by the state during the base period from a special administrative fund provided for by law, into which moneys, in addition to, or other than from the state treasury, are placed, the payment into the unemployment compensation fund shall be made from such special administrative fund in the regular manner provided for disbursing such money.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The payment by the state into the unemployment compensation fund shall be made at such times and in such manner as the commissioner of the department of employment security, with the approval of the commissioner of administrative services, may determine and prescribe.
