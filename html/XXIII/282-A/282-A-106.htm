I. The provisions of RSA 282-A:103 through 105, to the extent that they relate to the unemployment trust fund, shall be operative only so long as such unemployment trust fund continues to exist and so long as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America continues to maintain for this state a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by this state for benefit purposes, together with this state's proportionate share of the earnings of such unemployment trust fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If and when such unemployment trust fund ceases to exist, or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all moneys, properties, or securities therein, belonging to the unemployment compensation fund of this state shall be transferred to the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release such moneys, properties or securities in a manner approved by the commissioner of the department of employment security in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;  provided that such moneys shall be invested in the following readily marketable classes of securities:  Bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of the United States of America, or of this state or of its political subdivisions.
