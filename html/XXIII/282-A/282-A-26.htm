&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:26 Weekly Benefit for Partial Unemployment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each eligible individual who is partially unemployed in any week shall be paid a partial benefit with respect to such week.  Such partial benefit shall be an amount calculated to the nearest dollar which, if added to his wages, as used in RSA 282-A:14, III, for such week, would equal his weekly benefit amount.  Such partial benefit shall not be reduced because an individual received payments from a supplemental unemployment plan as defined in RSA 282-A:3-a.  An individual who receives such supplemental unemployment payments who received no wages as defined in RSA 282-A:14, III shall be deemed not to be partially unemployed but to be totally unemployed.
