&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The appellate board shall hear appeals from decisions of the appeal tribunal or final decisions of the commissioner under RSA 282-A:95.  An appeal must be filed with the appellate board or, if filed by mail, postmarked within 14 calendar days of the date of mailing of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner's decision on a request for reopening or the final decision of the commissioner;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The appeal tribunal's decision on an appeal which had been remanded by the appellate board, in which case a request for reopening is not required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The appellate board may allow a late appeal, if, in its opinion, good cause exists.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The review by the appellate board shall be confined to the record.  No evidence shall be received.  The appellate board shall provide all parties and the commissioner with a tape recording of the appeal tribunal;  however, the appellate board chair may require a transcription of the first level hearing.  In such case a copy shall be provided to all parties.  The commissioner shall provide the appellate board with a copy of all other department records relating to the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The appellate board may decline to review any appeal which presents no substantial question within the appellate board's jurisdiction as set forth in RSA 282-A:65.
