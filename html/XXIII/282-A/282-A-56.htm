&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:56 Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A hearing shall be conducted in such a manner as to ensure a fair and impartial hearing to the interested parties.  The appeal tribunal shall hear the appeal de novo and shall not be bound by prior findings or determinations of the department of employment security although the records of said department shall be part of the evidence to be considered by the tribunal.  An appeal shall be filed and presented and the hearing conducted in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner.  Such rules need not conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence or other technical rules of procedure.  The place and time of a hearing shall be determined by the commissioner.  In no case shall a hearing proceed unless the chairman is present.  With the agreement of all the parties the appeal tribunal may, without holding a hearing, remand a determination for redetermination pursuant to RSA 282-A:46 for the purpose of correcting obvious department error.
