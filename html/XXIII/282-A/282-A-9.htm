I. "Employment'' means service, including service in interstate commerce, performed for wages or under any contract of hire, written or oral, expressed or implied, together with service performed within the state which constitutes "employment'' under the provisions of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the term "employment'' shall also include all service performed after January 1, 1947, by an officer or member of the crew of an American vessel on or in connection with such vessel, provided that there is located within this state the operating office from which the operations of such vessel operating on navigable waters within or within and without the United States is ordinarily and regularly supervised, managed, directed and controlled.  The term "employment'' shall include an individual's entire service, performed within or both within and without this state, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The service is localized within the state (i.e., performed either entirely within the state or performed both within and without the state if the service performed without is incidental to that performed within);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the service cannot be considered as localized in any state but some of the service is performed in the state and (i) the individual's base of operations, or if there is no base of operations, then the place from which such service is directed or controlled, is in the state;  or (ii) the individual's base of operations or place from which such service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual's residence is in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In no event shall services performed without this state be deemed to be employment subject to this chapter if contributions are required to be paid with respect thereto under an unemployment compensation law of any other state or of the federal government.  The commissioner of the department of employment security may adopt rules by which an employing unit may elect that the services performed for it entirely without this state by a resident of this state shall be deemed to constitute employment subject to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed or that such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed;  and
