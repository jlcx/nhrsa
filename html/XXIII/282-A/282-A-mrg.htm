(b) If the service cannot be considered as localized in any state but some of the service is performed in the state and (i) the individual's base of operations, or if there is no base of operations, then the place from which such service is directed or controlled, is in the state;  or (ii) the individual's base of operations or place from which such service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual's residence is in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In no event shall services performed without this state be deemed to be employment subject to this chapter if contributions are required to be paid with respect thereto under an unemployment compensation law of any other state or of the federal government.  The commissioner of the department of employment security may adopt rules by which an employing unit may elect that the services performed for it entirely without this state by a resident of this state shall be deemed to constitute employment subject to this chapter.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) An individual shall be deemed "totally unemployed'' in any week with respect to which no wages are payable to him and during which he performs no services.  An individual who is not entitled to vacation pay from his employer shall be deemed to be in "total unemployment'' during the entire period of any general closing of his employer's place of business for vacation purposes, notwithstanding his prior assent, direct or indirect, to the establishment of such vacation period by his employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An individual who is seeking only part-time work shall be deemed to be partially unemployed only in any week during which the individual was employed fewer than 20 hours.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An individual shall be deemed to be "partially unemployed'' in any week of less than full-time work if the wages computed to the nearest dollar payable to him with respect to such week fail to equal his weekly benefit amount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) For the purposes of paragraphs I and II, the term "wages'' shall include compensation for temporary partial disability under the workers' compensation law of any state or under a similar law of the United States, payments in lieu of notice, a sickness or separation allowance, payment of accrued leave or sums of whatever type or nature, except those specifically excluded elsewhere in this subparagraph, payments upon discharge from military service from either the state or federal government, or both, and earnings from self-employment.  "Wages'' shall not mean and shall not include payments from a supplemental unemployment plan as defined in RSA 282-A:3-a or any portion of a lump sum payment for workers' compensation made pursuant to RSA 281-A:37.  Wages or earnings or both shall be deemed to have been received for such week or weeks as the commissioner may find can be reasonably said to apply.  The application of longevity, stay, retention, attendance, and similar payments commencing with a period of one or more weeks of partial or total unemployment shall be presumed reasonable if such payment was received 90 or fewer days prior to the commencement of such period.  An individual's maximum weekly benefit amount shall be reduced by all wages and earnings in excess of 30 percent, rounded to the nearest dollar, of the individual's weekly benefit amount.  Wages shall not include any payment made to an individual by reason of the individual's permanent separation from employment, for reasons other than retirement, under a prior existing plan maintained by employer contributions vested in the individual before the date of separation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The employing unit shall be liable to make restitution to the unemployment compensation fund in full for any and all unemployment benefits paid to an employee for a period covered by or reasonably deemed to be included in any arbitration award, back pay award, settlement agreement, or jury verdict.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:26 Weekly Benefit for Partial Unemployment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each eligible individual who is partially unemployed in any week shall be paid a partial benefit with respect to such week.  Such partial benefit shall be an amount calculated to the nearest dollar which, if added to his wages, as used in RSA 282-A:14, III, for such week, would equal his weekly benefit amount.  Such partial benefit shall not be reduced because an individual received payments from a supplemental unemployment plan as defined in RSA 282-A:3-a.  An individual who receives such supplemental unemployment payments who received no wages as defined in RSA 282-A:14, III shall be deemed not to be partially unemployed but to be totally unemployed.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A participant in the department of employment security's return to work program shall be entitled to certain benefits under RSA 281-A.  In the event that it is determined that a return to work program participant has been subject to an injury or occupational disease producing a disability arising out of and in the course of participation in the return to work program, the department of employment security shall not provide compensation pursuant to RSA 281-A:28, 281-A:28-a, 281-A:31, and 281-A:31-a.  However, a participant, who has been deemed eligible for unemployment compensation shall receive such benefits while otherwise eligible under RSA 282-A, or compensation equivalent to 90 percent of his or her weekly unemployment compensation benefit amount if the disability causes the participant to become ineligible for benefits under RSA 282-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When determining the amount of compensation provided pursuant to RSA 281-A:32 for a scheduled permanent impairment award, the amount of compensation shall be calculated by using the minimum wage at the time of injury multiplied by the average number of hours in training per week.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For a participant in the return to work program, RSA 281-A:8, I and II shall not apply and the following provisions shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A participant in the return to work program shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of this chapter and, on behalf of the participant or the participant's personal or legal representatives, to have waived all rights of action whether at common law or by statute or provided under the laws of any other state or otherwise:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Against the employer/training partner, or the employer/training partner's insurance carrier, or an association or group providing self-insurance to a number of employers, or the department and the return to work program;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except for intentional torts, against any officer, director, agent, servant, or employee acting on behalf of the entities named in subparagraph (a)(1).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The spouse of a return to work program participant entitled to benefits under this chapter, or any other person who might otherwise be entitled to recover damages on account of the participant's personal injury or death, shall have no direct action, either at common law or by statute or otherwise, to recover for such damages against any person identified in this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department of employment security may provide this benefit by appropriate means including purchasing and serving as the master policyholder for any insurance, by self-insurance, or by administrative services contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all other provisions of RSA 281-A shall apply.

I. The maximum weekly benefit amount of any individual who is receiving retirement pay, which means in this section a government or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or any similar periodic payment based on previous work, shall be reduced by an amount equal to such retirement pay or other payment which the commissioner finds can be reasonably said to apply to such week.  In the case of such a payment, not made under the Social Security Act or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, if the base period employer or chargeable employer under RSA 282-A:74 does not contribute to the fund from which such payments are made, this paragraph shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the employee contributed 50 percent or more to retirement pay as described in paragraph I, no portion of said payments shall be deducted from the individual's maximum weekly benefit amount.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) His benefit year having expired prior to such week, has no, or insufficient, annual earnings on the basis of which he could establish a new benefit year that would include such week;  and

Except when the result would be inconsistent with the other provisions of this section, as may be provided in the rules of the commissioner, the provisions of this chapter which apply to claims for, or the payment of, regular benefits shall apply to claims for, and the payment of, extended benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An individual shall be eligible to receive extended benefits with respect to any week of unemployment in his or her eligibility period only if the commissioner finds that with respect to such week:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Whenever an extended benefit period is to become effective in New Hampshire as a result of an "on'' indicator, or an extended benefit period is to be terminated as a result of an "off'' indicator, the commissioner shall make an appropriate announcement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Computations required by the provisions of subparagraph I(f) shall be made by the commissioner, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States Secretary of Labor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner is hereby authorized and directed to take such action as he deems in the best interests of the state to obtain that share of the cost of those benefits paid under this section which P.L. 91-373 provides to be paid to the state by the federal government.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In no event shall benefits payable under the laws of this state to any individual exceed with respect to any benefit year an amount equal to 46 times the individual's maximum weekly benefit amount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Except as provided in this paragraph, payment of extended benefits shall not be made to any individual for any week if extended benefits would (but for this section) have been payable for such week pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any state under the interstate benefit payment plan, if an extended benefit period is not also in effect for such week in such state.  This section shall not apply with respect to the first 2 weeks for which extended benefits are payable (determined without regard to this paragraph) pursuant to an interstate claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. An individual shall be ineligible for benefits under this chapter for any week of unemployment in his eligibility period,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) During which he fails to accept any offer of work which is within such individual's capabilities, if the gross average weekly remuneration payable to such individual for the position exceeds the sum of the individual's average weekly benefit amount for his benefit year, plus the amount (if any) of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits (as defined in section 501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) payable to such individual for such week, and the position was offered to such individual in writing and was listed with the state employment services, and the position pays wages equally to or more than the minimum wage provided by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, without regard to any exemption, or the applicable New Hampshire minimum wage, whichever is higher, or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) During which he fails to actively engage in seeking work by engaging in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work during such week, and provides tangible evidence that he has engaged in such an effort.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Except that, if the individual furnished evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that such individual's prospects for obtaining work in his customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, the determination of whether any work is suitable work with respect to such individual shall be made in accordance with the provisions of RSA 282-A:32, I(d).  No work shall be suitable under this section which does not satisfy the requirements of RSA 282-A:32, I(d)(2)(A), (B) and (C).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Ineligibility under this provision shall not end until the individual has subsequently been employed during at least 4 weeks and earned 4 times his weekly extended benefit amount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The requirements of this section do not suspend or replace any other requirement of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An employer wishing to participate in a worksharing program shall submit a written and signed worksharing plan to the commissioner for approval.  The commissioner may approve a worksharing plan if the following criteria, and any other criteria the commissioner deems relevant, are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The plan identifies the affected unit or units to which it applies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The employees in the affected unit are identified by name, social security number, the normal weekly hours of work, and proposed weekly wage and hour reduction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The normal weekly hours of work by employees in the affected unit are reduced by not less than 10 percent and not more than 50 percent and the reduction in hours in each affected unit is spread equally among employees in the affected unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The plan provides that health benefits and retirement benefits under a defined benefit plan (as defined in section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code) or contributions under a defined contribution plan (as defined in section 414(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) shall continue to be provided to the employees in the affected units under the same terms and conditions as though their normal weekly hours of work had not been reduced, or to the same extent as other employees not participating in the worksharing program, and specifies the effect, if any, the reduction in the normal weekly hours of work will have on other fringe benefits provided by the employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The plan certifies that the reduction in the normal weekly hours of work is instead of layoffs and states the reason for and expected duration of the work reduction.  The plan shall not serve as a subsidy of seasonal employment during the off-season, nor as a subsidy of temporary part-time or intermittent employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The plan describes the manner in which the requirements of this section will be implemented (including a plan for giving notice, where feasible, to an employee whose work week is to be reduced) together with an estimate of the number of layoffs that would have occurred absent the ability to participate in the worksharing program.  If advance notice of the implementation of the worksharing plan is not feasible, the plan shall explain why it is not feasible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The written approval by the collective bargaining representative for each affected unit is included in the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The plan specifies a beginning and ending date.  The ending date shall be not more than 26 weeks from the beginning date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The plan contains an agreement by the employer to furnish all reports and information necessary for the administration of the plan and to permit access by the commissioner to all records necessary to verify and evaluate the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) No employee's participation in the plan shall be precluded or limited by any particular definition of attachment to the employer, such as length of employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) The plan applies to only full-time or permanent part-time employees.  No seasonal employees may participate in a worksharing plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) The plan certifies that the employer has paid all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, or penalty charges due under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) The plan certifies that its terms and their implementation are consistent with employer obligations under applicable federal and state laws. 
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall approve or reject a worksharing plan in writing no later than 15 business days after its receipt.  The commissioner's rejection of the worksharing plan shall be final and shall not be appealable, but rejection shall not prevent an employer from submitting another plan for approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An approved worksharing plan may be modified only with the approval of the commissioner.  The worksharing employer shall notify the commissioner in writing of any proposed changes in the conditions of an approved plan.  If the proposed changes meet the requirements for approval of a plan, the commissioner may approve the modifications.  If the modifications do not meet the requirements for approval, the commissioner may revoke the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may revoke approval of a worksharing plan for good cause.  The revocation order shall be in writing and shall specify the date the revocation is effective and the reasons for the revocation.  Good cause for revocation shall include, but is not limited to, failure to comply with the assurances given in the plan, unreasonable revision of the productivity standards for the affected unit, conduct or occurrences tending to defeat the intent and effective operation of the plan, and violation of the criteria on which approval of the plan was based.  Such action may be initiated at any time by the commissioner on his or her own motion, or at the request of any of the affected unit's employees, or at the request of the appropriate collective bargaining agent.  The revocation order shall be final and shall not be appealed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. At the end of the worksharing period provided in subparagraph I(g), the worksharing employer may submit a new worksharing plan to the commissioner for approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The provisions of RSA 282-A:161, RSA 282-A:163, RSA 282-A:164, RSA 282-A:165, RSA 282-A:166, and RSA 282-A:166-a shall apply to any information submitted in connection with an application for approval or modification of a worksharing plan, the implementation of an approved worksharing plan, or the payment of worksharing benefits.  An employer shall also be liable for the repayment to the commissioner of any worksharing benefits improperly paid by the commissioner as a result of information the employer submitted to the commissioner in connection with the approval, modification, or implementation of a worksharing plan which is substantially misleading or contains a material misrepresentation of fact.  In addition, a claimant shall be liable for the repayment to the commissioner of any worksharing benefits which were improperly paid due to the fault of the claimant.  The commissioner may utilize any remedies provided by this chapter to recover worksharing benefits.

The weekly worksharing benefit amount shall not be reduced by reason of application of the provisions of RSA 282-A:26 to remuneration received from the worksharing employer.  If in any week an individual performs services for a worksharing employer and an employer other than the worksharing employer, the weekly worksharing benefit amount shall be reduced by the amount by which the remuneration received from the non-worksharing employer exceeds 30 percent of the maximum benefit rate in effect.
<br>

<br>

VI. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter relating to charges, all worksharing benefits shall be charged to the account of the worksharing employer.  Benefits paid under this section shall be charges to the employer's account in the same manner as regular benefits are charged, except that, if the employer pays contributions in accordance with RSA 282-A:87, Schedules II and III, the employer shall be charged and billed as if it had elected to make payments in lieu of contributions under RSA 282-A:70.

<center><h3>Section 282-A:32</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:32 Disqualifications for Benefits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this section, "date'' as used in "subsequent to the date'' means the last calendar day on which the individual performed services for the employer.  An individual shall be disqualified for benefits and no waiting period may be served:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Until the individual has earned in each of 5 weeks wages in employment as defined in RSA 282-A:9, except RSA 282-A:9, IV(f), or wages earned in a like manner in another state, of at least 20 percent more than such individual's weekly benefit amount, subsequent to the date:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The individual left work voluntarily without good cause in accordance with rules of the commissioner.  This section shall not apply and benefits shall be paid without regard thereto where:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An unemployed individual, not under a disqualification, accepts employment which would not have been deemed suitable work under subparagraph (d) and terminates such employment within a period of not more than 12 consecutive weeks of employment with or without good cause;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An individual terminates employment in good faith to accept better employment, which is to begin within a reasonable period;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The individual reasonably believes that separation from employment is necessary to protect himself or herself or any member of his or her immediate family from domestic abuse, as defined in RSA 173-B:1.  The existence of domestic abuse shall be verified by the department, through reasonable documentation, and the department shall keep such information confidential;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The individual is separated from employment because he or she has become unable to perform some or all of his or her job duties due to pregnancy or to an illness or injury that is not work-related, provided that a physician has attested to the individual's inability to perform work duties in a written notice.  Nothing in this section shall relieve an employer of the duty to provide reasonable accommodation as that term is defined by state or federal law;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The leaving of employment was necessary to allow the individual to accompany his or her spouse to a place from which it is impractical for the individual to commute due to a change in location of the spouse's employment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The leaving of employment was due to the illness or disability of a member of the individual's immediate family as those terms are defined by the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) He was discharged for misconduct connected with his work, if so found by the commissioner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The individual has failed, without good cause, either to apply for available, suitable work when so directed by the employment office or the commissioner or to accept suitable work when offered him or her, or to return to his or her customary self-employment (if any) when so directed by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the commissioner determines that work in the individual's customary occupation, at the individual's customary rate of pay, is immediately available within the individual's labor market area, the commissioner, to find that any work is suitable for an individual, shall determine each of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) That the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety and morals in performing such work is reasonable;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) That the individual's physical fitness reasonably allows the individual to perform the essential functions of the work;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) That the individual's prior training and experience reasonably allow the individual to successfully perform or to acquire those skills necessary to perform the work;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) That the distance of the available work from the individual's residence is reasonable;  but such distance shall not be considered reasonable if it is both substantially greater than that distance to all those places to which others living in the same town or city travel for work which utilizes similar or related skills or services, and also substantially greater than the distance to where the individual acquired his or her currently available annual earnings;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) That the rate of pay for the work is reasonable in light of the individual's prior earnings and length of unemployment, but in determining whether the rate of pay is reasonable his or her prior earnings shall be given more weight than his or her length of unemployment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the commissioner determines that work in the individual's customary occupation and at the individual's customary rate of pay is not immediately available within the individual's labor market area, the commissioner, to find that any work is suitable for an individual, shall determine each of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) That the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety and morals in performing such work is reasonable;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) That the individual's physical fitness reasonably allows the individual to perform the essential functions of the work;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) That the individual's prior training and experience reasonably allow the individual to successfully perform, or to acquire those skills necessary to perform, the work;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) That the distance of the available work from the individual's residence is reasonable;  but such distance shall not be considered reasonable if it is both substantially greater than that distance to all those places to which others living in the same town or city travel for work which utilizes similar or related skills or services, and also substantially greater than the distance to where the individual acquired the individual's currently available annual earnings;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) That the work, part-time or full-time, pays minimum wage or an hourly rate which when multiplied times 40 is equal to or greater than 150 percent of the individual's weekly benefit, whichever is greater;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) That the wages, hours, or other conditions of the temporary work are not substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar temporary or permanent work in the locality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new full-time or part-time work under any of the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) If, as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) If the individual is unable to apply for or accept full-time or part-time work during the hours of a particular shift because he or she is the only adult available for the care of an ill, infirm, or physically or mentally disabled family member whom a licensed physician has certified is in need of care for the activities of daily living;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) If the individual is unable to apply for or accept full-time or part-time work during the hours of a particular shift because he or she is the only adult available for the care of a natural, adopted, step, or foster child under the age of 16;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) If the individual is permanently physically and/or mentally disabled, full-time or part-time work for such individual shall be deemed to be the hours and shifts the individual is physically able to work as certified by a licensed physician provided there is a market for the services the individual offers during such hours and shifts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, benefits shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new suitable, temporary, full-time, or part-time work, offered to the individual without the expectation of such work becoming permanent, for any week which follows the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The last week which includes one or more days within the maximum expected duration of the temporary work;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The fifth week of the 5 weeks in which the individual, subsequent to the date the individual refused such temporary work, meets the earnings requalification requirements of RSA 282-A:32, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) For the purposes of section 3304(a)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, this subsection, together with RSA 282-A:31, I(c) shall be waived.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) He left his self-employment or closed his business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For any period for which proper and timely claims were not filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For any week during which the individual resides other than in New Hampshire, another state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or a contiguous country with which the United States has an agreement with respect to unemployment compensation.

A person shall be disqualified for benefits for any week with respect to which the commissioner finds that his or her total or partial unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which he or she is or was last employed;  provided that this section shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The person is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute;  provided that, if in any case separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premises;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The person has become unemployed and entitled to unemployment compensation before the commencement of the labor dispute and his connection with the employer has been totally severed, including the absence of recall rights, seniority rights and other fringe benefits and indicia of employment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The stoppage of work was due solely to a lockout or the failure of the employer to live up to the provision of any agreement or contract of employment entered into between the employer and his or her employees;  or

<codesect>
A determination shall be a decision by the certifying officer on a claim and shall be made, except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A determination on an initial claim for total or partial benefits for any week shall include:  the maximum duration thereof;  whether or not, with the reasons therefor, the claimant is payable for such week and for consecutive weeks thereafter for which claims are filed (no other fact appearing to the contrary during such period);  and identification of the employer whose account will be charged with benefits to be paid by reason of such determination.  This determination shall in every case be mailed to all interested parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. A determination on the first claim in a benefit year shall be mailed to the claimant and shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The annual earnings in the base period with the name of each employer reporting wages paid to the claimant, and the amount of such wages;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The maximum benefits then available;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The maximum weekly benefit amount and the maximum duration of such weekly benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A determination shall be made by a certifying officer on any claim for benefits, though not an initial claim, if, in his judgment, there appears to be an issue relative to the entitlement of the claimant to benefits.  The determination shall be in the manner provided in paragraph I, and the interested parties shall be notified in the same manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that a determination be made with respect to a claim for any week or where the week is one of any of the consecutive weeks for which benefits are paid immediately following the week with respect to which a determination is made under paragraph I except as provided in paragraph II.

I. Except as provided in RSA 282-A:45-a, in finding the facts material to a claim, the certifying officer shall in every case in which the reason for an individual's leaving employment may be material:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Send to the last employing unit or any employer who was or may be charged with benefits and any employing unit or employer whenever a claimant's reason for leaving their employ may be material to the claim a notice of the filing of a claim advising the employer or employing unit of the material information provided by the claimant and advising the employer or employing unit whether the department will initiate contact with the employer or employing unit to obtain full and complete information or whether the employer or employing unit is required to contact the department to dispute the information provided by the claimant;  and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:45-a Fact Finding for Mass Layoffs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Fact finding for mass layoffs, whether such layoff is temporary or permanent, shall be in accordance with the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An employing unit or employer shall file a mass layoff notice with the department if the employer lays off or expects to lay off 25 or more individuals:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the same calendar week;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For an expected duration of 7 days or more;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For either of the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Vacation or holiday shutdown;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Company closure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The mass layoff notice form required in paragraph I may be on one or more forms and shall be as provided for in the rules adopted by the commissioner, including such time limitations as the commissioner deems appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Failure on the part of the employing unit or employer or both to file the notice required in paragraph I shall, at the expiration of the period set for response, be deemed an irrevocable waiver of its right to be heard before the determination is made.  Benefits charged to its account as a result of the determination shall remain so charged even though the claimant is, by reason of some later decision, held not to be entitled to such benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An employing unit or employer may be granted a waiver from filing the mass layoff notice required in paragraph I if the commissioner determines, in accordance with such rules as the commissioner shall adopt, that it is unlikely that 25 or more of the individuals laid off will file an initial claim, as defined in RSA 282-A:42, II(a), due to the expected receipt of wages, as defined in RSA 282-A:14, III.  Any such waiver shall become void if in fact 25 or more of the individuals laid off claim benefits.

The appellate board shall within 30 days deny or grant the motion for reconsideration or order a new hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An interested party who has exhausted all administrative remedies within the department and who is aggrieved by a final decision of the appeal tribunal as reversed, modified, or affirmed by the appellate board after a motion for reconsideration is granted or denied or after the decision on rehearing, may appeal that decision to the supreme court, but only if the notice of that appeal is filed with the court within 30 days after the date of mailing of the decision from which the appeal is taken and the notice of appeal is served upon the commissioner and the attorney general contemporaneously with the filing of that notice of appeal with the court.  In addition, that notice of appeal shall be served upon all parties of record.  The service required by this section may be in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

I. Contributions shall accrue and become payable by each employer for each calendar year, in which the employer is subject to this chapter, in an amount equal to 2.7 percent, except as otherwise provided in RSA 282-A:79-90, of the wages paid or payable for employment during such calendar year, not to exceed $14,000 which have been paid to an individual in any calendar year.  Such contributions shall become due and be paid by each employer to the commissioner of the department of employment security for the fund in accordance with such rules as the commissioner of the department of employment security may adopt and shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the wages of individuals in such employer's employ;  provided that the contributions of an employer becoming subject to the law within any calendar year shall be first due and payable after such employer has satisfied the conditions with respect to becoming an employer.  For the purposes of this section, the term "wages'' shall include service subject to contribution under any employment security law of another state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding this section, any organization or group of organizations, described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or Indian tribe as defined in RSA 282-A:8, VIII, which becomes an employer under this act, may elect to change its status either to reimburse in the manner provided for the state in RSA 282-A:70 or to pay contributions as hereinabove provided.  The change in status shall be irrevocable for 3 calendar years.  Thereafter the employer may elect to change its status no later than January 1, for any year, but such new change in status shall be irrevocable for 3 calendar years.  Any 2 or more of such employers or any 2 or more cities, towns, counties or other political subdivisions of this state may elect, for a period of not less than 3 years, to pool their separate accounts under such rules as may be adopted by the commissioner, including appropriate bonding and fiscal safeguard requirements, and each unit shall be jointly and severally liable for payments due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the payment of any contributions, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to  1/2 cent or more in which case it shall be increased to one cent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A contribution, as defined in RSA 282-A:152, I shall not be considered due for any purpose under this chapter from an employer required to pay contributions under this chapter when the total amount due is less than one dollar.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The following provisions shall apply to Indian tribes electing to make payments in lieu of contributions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At the discretion of the commissioner, any Indian tribe that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required within 30 days after the effective date of its election, to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Execute and file with the commissioner a surety bond approved by the commissioner;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Deposit with the commissioner money or securities on the same basis as other employers with the same election option.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Failure of the Indian tribe to make required payments, including assessments of interest and penalty, within 90 days of receipt of the bill will cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make payments in lieu of contributions for the following tax year unless payment in full is received before the contribution rate for the next tax year is computed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any Indian tribe that loses the option to make payments in lieu of contributions due to late payment or nonpayment shall have such option reinstated if, after a period of one year, all contributions have been made timely, provided no contributions, payments in lieu of contributions for benefits paid, penalties, or interest remain outstanding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Failure of the Indian tribe to make required payments, including assessments of interest and penalty, after all collection activities deemed necessary by the commissioner have been exhausted, will cause services performed for such tribe to not be treated as employment for purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner may determine that any Indian tribe that loses coverage under subparagraph (d) may have services performed for such tribe again included as employment for purposes of RSA 282-A:9 if all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties and interest have been paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The commissioner shall notify the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor of any termination or reinstatement of coverage made under subparagraphs (d) and (e).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Notices of payment and reporting delinquency to Indian tribes shall include information that failure to make full payment within the prescribed time frame:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Shall cause the Indian tribe to be liable for federal unemployment tax;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Shall cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make payments in lieu of contributions;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Could cause the Indian tribe to be excepted from the definition of employer, as provided in RSA 282-A:8, and services in the employ of the Indian tribe to be excepted from employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of an Indian tribe and not reimbursed by the federal government shall be financed in their entirety by such Indian tribe.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the following shall apply regarding assignment of rates and transfers of experience:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a)(1) If an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion thereof, to an employing unit or to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is any common ownership, management, or control of the 2 employers, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom such business is so transferred.  The rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective following the date of the transfer of trade or business in accordance with such rules as the commissioner may adopt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If, following a transfer of experience under subparagraph (1), the commissioner determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, then the experience rating of the employer accounts involved shall be combined and the combined rate assigned to each employer in accordance with such rules as the commissioner may adopt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whenever a person who is not an employer under this chapter at the time he or she acquires the trade or business, or a portion thereof, of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to such person if the commissioner finds that such person acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions.  Instead, such person shall be assigned the new employer rate under RSA 282-A:81.

(c) In determining whether there is any common ownership, management, or control of 2 employers, the commissioner shall use objective factors which may include the extent of commonality or similarity of:  ownership;  any familial relationships;  principals or corporate officers;  organizational structure;  day-to-day operations;  assets and liabilities;  and stated business purposes.  Ownership of publicly-traded mutual funds, publicly-traded stocks, and similar publicly-traded investments shall not be indicative of common ownership, management, or control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In determining whether a substantial purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, the commissioner shall use objective standards which may include the cost of acquiring the business to which the experience was transferred, how long such business enterprise was continued after the transfer, the extent to which such business enterprise reduced its workforce following the transfer, the size of each employer's workforce before and after the transfer, and the business activity conducted by each employer prior to, and after, the transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the commissioner shall use objective factors which may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long such business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f)(1) If a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate subparagraph (a), (b), or (i) or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate, or if a person knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a violation of such provision, the person shall be subject to the following penalties:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) If the person is an employer, such employer shall be assigned the highest rate assignable under this chapter for the rate year during which such violation or attempted violation occurred and the 3 rate years immediately following this rate year.  However, if the person's business is already at such highest rate for any year, or if the amount of increase in the person's rate would be less than 2 percent for such year, then a penalty rate of contributions of 2 percent of taxable wages shall be imposed for such year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) If the person is not an employer, such person shall be subject to a civil fine of not more than $5,000.  Any such fine shall be deposited in the fund established by RSA 282-A:140.  Such person shall also be jointly and severally liable with any liable employer for additional contributions and all related penalties, fees, interest, and costs owed as a result of the application of this section.  Such person shall be subject to civil action for such liability in any manner provided for collection of contributions in RSA 282-A:141-156.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In addition to other penalties imposed in this paragraph, any violation of this section may be prosecuted under RSA 282-A:166 or any other appropriate statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The commissioner shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a business for purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) For purposes of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Knowingly'' means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the prohibition involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Person'' means "person'' as defined in section 7701(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Trade or business'' includes the employer's workforce.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) "Violates'' or "attempts to violate'' includes, but is not limited to, intent to evade, misrepresentation, and willful nondisclosure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The reporting by an employer of its payroll under the account of another employer with which there is no common ownership, management, or control, is prohibited unless the reporting employer is an employee leasing company lawfully making such report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A management company which contracts with any employer to report wages of managed employees shall be considered, in accordance with such rules as the commissioner may adopt, to have common management or control with such employer, and with any other management company with which the employer may contract for the same purpose in the future.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:93 Acquisition of Segregable Unit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever any employing unit, whether or not an employing unit at the time, in any manner succeeds to, or has succeeded to, or acquires, or has acquired, a segregable portion of an employer's organization, trade, or business, and all of the assets of that employer devoted to that segregable portion, with the intent to continue the organization, the trade and the business of that segregable portion, it may assume for all purposes the position of such employer with respect to such employer's separate account and contribution liability to the extent such separate account and contribution liability is assignable to such segregable unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If such succeeding employing unit is at the time of acquisition an employer, it shall continue to pay contributions at the rate assigned to it until the end of the then current tax year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If such succeeding employing unit is not at the time of acquisition an employer, it shall pay contributions at the rate assigned to the transferring employer until the end of the then current tax year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No transfer of a portion of any employer's separate account shall be made under RSA 282-A:91-93 except upon application of the succeeding employing unit and waiver by the transferring employer of all its rights and interest in such segregable portion of its separate account.  Application in writing together with the notarized waiver shall be filed with the commissioner within 30 days from the date on which the acquisition occurs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For the purpose of RSA 282-A:91-93, "segregable unit'' shall mean a separately maintained, housed and conducted establishment whose activities have been physically detached from the other plants, factories or premises of the employer and for which the employer has maintained separate books of account including payrolls.  A unit shall be considered segregable only for the periods during which such separation of location and books of account are maintained.

The moneys in this fund may, solely as determined by the commissioner, be used for the following purposes:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As a revolving fund to cover expenditures (necessary and proper under the law) for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, subject to the charging of such expenditures against such funds if and when received;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) [Repealed.]

Moneys, as determined by the commissioner, in this fund shall not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner which would permit their substitution for (or a corresponding reduction in) federal funds which would, in the absence of said moneys, be available to finance expenditures for the administration of this chapter.  This fund shall be used by the commissioner for the payment of costs of administration which are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against federal grants (or other funds) received for or in the unemployment compensation and employment service administration fund on or after May 11, 1949.  The moneys in this fund are hereby specifically made available to replace, within a reasonable time, any moneys received by this state pursuant to section 302 of the Social Security Act, as amended, which, because of any action or contingency, have been lost or expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those necessary for the proper administration of this chapter.

Such money may also be requisitioned and used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this state's unemployment compensation law and public employment offices but only pursuant to a specific appropriation by the legislature and only if the expenses are incurred and the money is requisitioned after the date of enactment of an appropriation law which specifies the purpose for which such money is appropriated and the amount appropriated therefor.  Such appropriation is subject to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of subparagraph I(b), the amounts obligated under an appropriation for the above-described administrative purposes shall be charged against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Money appropriated as provided herein for the payment of expenses of administration shall be requisitioned as needed for the payment of obligations incurred under such appropriation and, upon requisition, shall be deposited in the fund established in RSA 282-A:140 from which such payments shall be made.  Money so deposited shall, until expended, remain a part of the unemployment fund and, if it will not be immediately expended, shall be returned promptly to the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding paragraph I, moneys credited with respect to federal fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, shall be used by the commissioner with the consent and acceptance of governor and council or budget legislation of allocated funds solely for the administration of the unemployment compensation program and are not subject to appropriation by the legislature.  The Reed Act distribution under section 903(c) of the Social Security Act, transferred to the state in October 1998 with respect to the federal fiscal year 1998, shall be used solely for the administration of this state's unemployment compensation law.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the commissioner believes that the collection of contributions will be jeopardized by delay, he shall immediately assess on the basis of whatever information he may have such contributions together with all interest and penalties, whether or not the time prescribed by RSA 282-A:69 through 98 and this subdivision or by the rules adopted by the commissioner for making return and paying such contributions has expired.  Such contributions, interest and penalties shall thereupon become immediately due and payable;  and immediate notice and demand, either in person or in writing, shall be made by the commissioner or his duly authorized representatives for the payment thereof.  Upon failure or refusal to pay immediately such contributions, interest and penalties, collection thereof by any means provided in this subdivision shall be lawful without regard to the period prescribed in RSA 282-A:151 or by the rules of the commissioner and proceedings may also be instituted under RSA 282-A:161-168 for such failure or refusal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The collection of the whole or any part of the amount of such assessment may be stayed by filing with the commissioner a bond in such amount as is equal to the amount to which the stay is desired and with such sureties as the commissioner deems necessary conditioned on payment of the amount collection of which is stayed, at the time at which, but for this section, such amount would be due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An assessment under this section shall not finally fix the amount of such contributions, interest and penalties.  Where the amount due is subsequently discovered to be greater than that assessed, the balance shall be collected by any means provided in this subdivision.  If the amount due is subsequently discovered to be less than that assessed, it shall be adjusted in the manner provided by RSA 282-A:149.

Such determination shall finally fix the amount of contribution unless the employer shall initiate an appeal in the manner provided in RSA 282-A:94-98.  The determination of the commissioner shall be deemed to be prima facie correct, and the burden of proving error therein shall be upon the employer.  Except for good cause shown, no ground of error shall be considered unless set forth in the petition of appeal.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Is in substantial compliance with such payment plan.

III. The notice of garnishment shall advise the individual debtor and individual debtor's employer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Of the employer's obligation to provide one of the duplicate copies of the notice of garnishment to the individual debtor upon receipt;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Of the amount which may be garnished for any week;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Of the employer's right to add and retain a fee of $1.00 for each garnishment for the administrative cost incurred as a result of the garnishment procedures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. With respect to the individual debtor's right to file for suspension of the notice of garnishment, the notice of garnishment shall state as follows, in at least 12-point type:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This notice of garnishment requires your employer to garnish (take) some of your earnings for work and send them to the department of employment security to repay overpaid unemployment insurance benefits.  Once earnings for a week have been garnished, you will not be able to get them back.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You have the right, at any time, to file for suspension (stopping) of this garnishment.  If you file for suspension of garnishment, the department of employment security has the right to take you to court to ask a judge to decide how much, if any, of your earnings should be garnished.  Instead of going to court, you and the department may be able to agree to a different amount of garnishment.  If you want to file for suspension or make an agreement with the department, you must call the department of employment security at _____________.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The amount which may be garnished for each week shall be determined by the department based on the individual debtor's financial circumstances known to the department, including but not limited to the individual debtor's financial affidavit, if available.

(b) Apply the garnishment to any current or subsequent earnings paid 21 or more days after the date of issuance of the notice of garnishment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Not garnish for any week more than the amount allowed;

(e) Give priority to any amounts that the employer is obligated to withhold pursuant to RSA 458-B over amounts subject to garnishment under this section;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Not allow the amount garnished pursuant to this section, including any fee added and retained under paragraph VII, when added to the amount withheld pursuant to RSA 458-B to exceed 25 percent of the individual debtor's weekly disposable earnings, or the amount by which the individual debtor's weekly disposable earnings exceed 50 times the minimum hourly wage as established by the Fair Labor Standards Act, whichever is less;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Implement garnishment no later than the first payment of earnings that occurs 21 or more days after the notice was mailed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Treat the garnishment as binding upon the employer until payment in full is made of the total amount subject to garnishment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Send the garnished amount to the commissioner at the same time the individual debtor is paid;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Notify the commissioner within 20 days of the individual debtor's termination of employment, and shall provide the individual debtor's last known address and the name and address of the present employer, if known.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Be liable for the accumulated amount it should have garnished if it fails to garnish in accordance with the provisions of the notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The employer shall be liable for an administrative fine of $100 per pay period for each individual debtor with respect to whom the employer has willfully failed to comply with the provisions of subparagraphs VIII(g) and VIII(j).  For other willful violations of this section an administrative fine of not less than $100 or more than $500 may be imposed.  Prior to assessing such fine against the employer, the commissioner shall notify the employer of its intent to assess the fine, the amount of the fine, the date by which the fine is payable, and shall provide the employer with the opportunity to appeal the imposition of the fine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. An employer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to $1,000:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For discharging, refusing to employ, or taking any disciplinary action against an individual debtor because of the garnishment procedures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph VIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Notwithstanding the 90-day limitation in paragraph II an individual debtor may, subject to the approval of the department, agree to voluntary garnishment at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. An individual debtor may file for suspension of the notice of garnishment at any time.  If the individual debtor files for suspension of the notice of garnishment, the department may file a motion for periodic payments in the Merrimack county sixth Circuit court seeking establishment of an order for payments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. If an individual debtor files for suspension of the notice of garnishment, the department shall suspend the notice of garnishment and advise any employer upon which the notice of garnishment was served to suspend garnishment of earnings paid not later than 8 days following receipt of notice to suspend.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. If an individual debtor who filed for suspension of the notice of garnishment and the department reach an agreement as to the amount which may be garnished for any week, the department may issue a new notice of garnishment consistent with such agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. Following the expiration of 90 days after the date a determination which finds an individual debtor overpaid under RSA 282-A:164 becomes final, such determination with interest under RSA 282-A:141, shall be for purposes of RSA 524:6-a the judgment of any circuit court-district division in which the department files a motion for periodic payments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. Following the issuance of an order for payments by any circuit court-district division on any overpayment due to the state under RSA 282-A:164 for more than 90 days, the department may serve a notice of court-ordered garnishment upon any employer that owes, or may owe in the future, earnings to such individual debtor.  Any notice of court-ordered garnishment served upon any employer shall be simultaneously served upon the individual debtor by certified mail to his or her last known address.  The amount which may be garnished for any week shall not exceed that amount, applied weekly, deemed appropriate by the circuit court-district division in its order for payments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. The notice of court-ordered garnishment shall advise the individual debtor and individual debtor's employer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Of the information required by III(a)-(d) and (f)-(l) of this section;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Of the individual debtor's right to file a motion with the Merrimack county sixth circuit court seeking a change in the amount of the payments based on a change in financial circumstances;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. With respect to the individual debtor's right to file a motion with the Merrimack county sixth circuit court, the notice of court-ordered garnishment shall state as follows, in at least 12-point type:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This notice of court-ordered garnishment requires your employer to garnish (take) some of your earnings for work and send them to the department of employment security to repay overpaid unemployment insurance benefits.  The amount of the garnishment is based on an order of the Merrimack county sixth circuit court.  Once earnings for a week have been garnished, you will not be able to get them back.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You have the right, at any time, to file a motion with the Merrimack county sixth circuit court asking for the amount of the garnishment to be changed based on a change in your financial circumstances.  If you want to file a motion, you should contact the Merrimack county sixth circuit court.  Nothing in this paragraph prevents you and the department of employment security from agreeing to a greater or lesser amount of garnishment and filing the agreement with the Merrimack county sixth circuit court.  If the department of employment security does not agree, you still have the right to file a motion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIX. The department may agree to a greater or lesser periodic amount than that amount deemed appropriate by the Merrimack county sixth circuit court in its order for payments, whether or not the individual debtor has requested a hearing before the court to obtain a change in the court's order, and any such agreement shall be filed with the Merrimack county sixth circuit court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XX. Within 7 days of receiving written notice that the individual debtor has filed a motion to request a change in the court's order, the department shall suspend or modify its notice of court-ordered garnishment consistent with the individual's request to the court.

<codesect>
The commissioner of the department of employment security is hereby authorized to enter into reciprocal arrangements with appropriate and duly authorized agencies of other states or of the federal government, or both, whereby:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Services performed by an individual for a single employing unit for which services are customarily performed by such individual in more than one state shall be deemed to be services performed entirely within any one of the states:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In which any part of such individual's service is performed, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In which such individual has his residence, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In which the employing unit maintains a place of business, provided there is in effect, as to such services, an election by an employing unit with the acquiescence of such individual, approved by the agency charged with the administration of such state's unemployment compensation law, pursuant to which services performed by such individual for such employing unit are deemed to be performed entirely within such state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Potential rights to benefits under this chapter may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits by another state or the federal government, and potential rights to benefits accumulated under the law of another state or the federal government may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits by this state.  Such benefits shall be paid under such provisions of this chapter or under the provisions of the law of such other state or the federal government, or under such combination of the provisions of both laws, as may be agreed upon and which will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.  No such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provision for reimbursement to the fund for such benefits as are paid on the basis of wages and service subject to the law of another state or the federal government, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provision for reimbursement from the fund for such benefits as are paid by another state or the federal government on the basis of wages and service subject to this chapter.  Reimbursements paid from the fund pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be benefits for the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Wages or services, upon the basis of which an individual is entitled or may become entitled to benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the federal government, shall be deemed to be wages for insured work for the purpose of determining his rights to benefits under this chapter;  and wages for insured work, on the basis of which an individual is entitled or may become entitled to benefits under this chapter, shall be deemed to be wages or services on the basis of which unemployment compensation is payable under such law of another state or of the federal government;  but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provisions for reimbursements to the fund for such of the benefits paid under this chapter upon the basis of such wages or services, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provisions for reimbursements from the fund for such of the compensation paid under such other law upon the basis of wages for insured work, as the commissioner of the department of employment security finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Contributions due under this chapter with respect to wages for insured work shall for the purposes of RSA 282-A:141-156 be deemed to have been paid to the fund as of the date payment was made as contributions therefor under another state or federal unemployment compensation law, but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains provisions for such reimbursement to the fund of such contributions as the commissioner of the department of employment security finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department of employment security may administer, at no cost to this state, as an agent of the United States of America, employment security and related programs authorized by the Congress of the United States and, pursuant thereto, may receive and disburse federally granted moneys.  All the power and authority otherwise granted in this chapter to the commissioner shall equally apply under this provision.  The commissioner may create outside the state treasury such special funds, the moneys in which shall not lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund, except as permitted by federal law, as he determines necessary to carry out the purposes of this provision.  Moneys granted by the federal government for payment of department personnel salaries and expenses, supplies, equipment and rent and such other expenses as are approved by the federal agency to carry out any agreement shall be deposited in the unemployment compensation and employment service administration fund provided by this chapter.  The treasurer, as provided in RSA 282-A:103-106, shall be the treasurer of such fund as is created hereunder, and it shall be safeguarded in such manner as may be required by federal law.  The cost of any bond required by any federal agency shall be paid from the unemployment compensation and employment service administration fund created by this chapter.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The payment of unemployment compensation benefits:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) To an individual who voluntarily leaves employment which is not suitable as specially defined in said Trade Act to enter training which has been approved under the Trade Act prior to said leaving.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An individual to receive unemployment compensation benefits though supplemented by a trade readjustment allowance or other assistance under the Trade Act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The use of moneys in the contingent fund provided by RSA 282-A:140 for payment to the United States of America where it has been found that there was gross negligence, fraud or failure to take appropriate recovery action by New Hampshire under the terms of the agreement.
