&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an employer shall fail to file a report for the purpose of determining the amount of contributions due under this chapter, or if such report when filed shall be incorrect or insufficient and the employer shall fail to file a correct or sufficient report within 20 days after the commissioner of the department of employment security shall have required the same by written notice, the commissioner shall determine the amount of contribution due, with interest thereon pursuant to RSA 282-A:141, from such employer on the basis of such information as he may be able to obtain;  and he shall give written notice of such determination to the employer.  Such determination shall finally fix the amount of contribution unless the employer shall initiate an appeal in the manner provided in RSA 282-A:94-98.  The determination of the commissioner shall be deemed to be prima facie correct, and the burden of proving error therein shall be upon the employer.  Except for good cause shown, no ground of error shall be considered unless set forth in the petition of appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If on appeal the determination of the commissioner shall be confirmed, or the amount of the contribution originally determined by the commissioner shall be increased, the cost of such proceedings, as in civil actions, shall be assessed against the employer.  No costs shall be assessed against the state on such appeal.
