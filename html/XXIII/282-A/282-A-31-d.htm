&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:31-d Benefits Payable. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The weekly worksharing benefit amount payable to an affected individual shall be the product of the regular weekly benefit amount, as defined in RSA 282-A:25 multiplied by the percentage reduction in the individual's normal weekly hours of work, rounded to the next lower full dollar amount.  The weekly worksharing benefit amount shall not be reduced by reason of application of the provisions of RSA 282-A:26 to remuneration received from the worksharing employer.  If in any week an individual performs services for a worksharing employer and an employer other than the worksharing employer, the weekly worksharing benefit amount shall be reduced by the amount by which the remuneration received from the non-worksharing employer exceeds 30 percent of the maximum benefit rate in effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The total worksharing benefit amount payable to an affected individual during any benefit year shall not exceed the amount of total benefits calculated under RSA 282-A:25 minus the amount of regular and worksharing benefits paid to said individual under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An individual who has received all the worksharing benefits or the combined regular benefits and worksharing benefits available in a benefit year shall be considered an exhaustee for purposes of extended benefits under RSA 282-A:30 and for any special federal extended benefits program, and, if otherwise eligible, shall be permitted to receive extended benefits and special federal extended benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An individual who performs no services during a week for the worksharing employer and is otherwise eligible shall be paid benefits in accordance with the other provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Claims for worksharing benefits shall be filed by the worksharing employer or as otherwise prescribed by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter relating to charges, all worksharing benefits shall be charged to the account of the worksharing employer.  Benefits paid under this section shall be charges to the employer's account in the same manner as regular benefits are charged, except that, if the employer pays contributions in accordance with RSA 282-A:87, Schedules II and III, the employer shall be charged and billed as if it had elected to make payments in lieu of contributions under RSA 282-A:70.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the provisions of this chapter, including the rules and regulations adopted under this chapter, shall apply to benefits under this section.
