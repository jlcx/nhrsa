I. The computation date shall be January 31.  The total for all past years of all benefits charged as of the computation date against an employer's separate account shall be subtracted from the total of all contributions paid on an employer's own behalf and credited as of the computation date to the employer's separate account for all past years.  Delinquent contributions received after January 31, 1997 shall be credited to the employer's separate account on the next computation or recomputation date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If contributions so credited exceed benefits so charged, the excess shall be computed as a percent of the employer's average annual payroll, which percent shall determine the contribution rate as provided in RSA 282-A:87, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Commencing with the computation date of January 31, 2010, if benefits so charged exceed contributions so credited, and benefits so charged have exceeded contributions so credited for 3 or fewer consecutive computation dates including the computation date of January 31, 2010, the excess shall be computed as a percent of the employer's average annual payroll, which percent shall determine the contribution rate as provided in RSA 282-A:87, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Commencing with the computation date of January 31, 2010, if benefits so charged exceed contributions so credited, and benefits so charged have exceeded contributions so credited for 4 or more consecutive computation dates including the computation date of January 31, 2010, the excess shall be computed as a percent of the employer's average annual payroll, which percent shall determine the contribution rate as provided in RSA 282-A:87, II-a.
