<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby created in the state treasury a special fund to be known as the contingent fund.  All interest, fines, late-filing fees and penalties collected under the provisions of this chapter after May 11, 1949, shall be paid into this fund.  The moneys in this fund may, solely as determined by the commissioner, be used for the following purposes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As a revolving fund to cover expenditures (necessary and proper under the law) for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, subject to the charging of such expenditures against such funds if and when received;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For rents;  equipment;  supplies;  motor vehicles and their maintenance;  fees;  costs of administration as specifically provided in this chapter;  salaries;  per diem and expense payments;  and training and education, whether institutional, departmental or conference-type, of assistant claim representatives, appeal tribunal and advisory council members and full and part-time department employees and department officers, including attendance at and hosting conferences and meetings sponsored or participated in by the United States department of labor and also in the Interstate Conference of Employment Security Agencies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The moneys in this fund may be used for any other purpose which upon request of the commissioner is found by the governor and council to be in furtherance of the administration of this chapter.  Moneys, as determined by the commissioner, in this fund shall not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner which would permit their substitution for (or a corresponding reduction in) federal funds which would, in the absence of said moneys, be available to finance expenditures for the administration of this chapter.  This fund shall be used by the commissioner for the payment of costs of administration which are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against federal grants (or other funds) received for or in the unemployment compensation and employment service administration fund on or after May 11, 1949.  The moneys in this fund are hereby specifically made available to replace, within a reasonable time, any moneys received by this state pursuant to section 302 of the Social Security Act, as amended, which, because of any action or contingency, have been lost or expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those necessary for the proper administration of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The moneys in this fund shall be continuously available to the commissioner for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall not lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund except as herein provided.  In the event that a refund of interest, a fine, a late-filing fee or penalty is found necessary, and such interest, fine, late-filing fee or penalty has been deposited in the contingent fund, such refund shall be made from the contingent fund.  This shall be administered and disbursed in the same manner and under the same conditions as other special funds of the state treasury.
