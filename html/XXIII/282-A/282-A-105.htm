<codesect>
The commissioner shall from time to time requisition from the unemployment trust fund such amounts, not exceeding the amounts standing to this state's account therein, as he deems necessary solely for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period.  Upon receipt thereof, the treasurer shall deposit such moneys in the benefit account.  Benefit payments shall be made solely from the benefit account.  All checks drawn on either the clearing account or benefit account shall bear the signature of the commissioner or his duly authorized agent for that purpose.  Any balance of moneys requisitioned from the unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were requisitioned shall either be deducted from estimates for, and may be utilized for the payment of, benefits during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the commissioner of the department of employment security, shall be redeposited with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America, to the credit of this state's account in the unemployment trust fund, as provided in RSA 282-A:104.
