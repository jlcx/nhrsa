<codesect>
The second level of appeal shall be to the commissioner.  The commissioner may, upon written request of an interested party or upon his own initiative, in any case in which a decision has been rendered, reopen the case on the basis of fraud, mistake, or newly discovered evidence.  Such request shall set forth the facts or argument considered to be the basis for the reopening.  Any request for reopening shall be received in his office or, if mailed, postmarked within 14 calendar days immediately following the date of the mailing of the appeal tribunal's decision provided that, if the commissioner finds sufficient grounds to justify or excuse a delay in filing, he may extend the time for filing the appeal.  The commissioner shall promptly notify in writing all interested parties of the request for reopening.
