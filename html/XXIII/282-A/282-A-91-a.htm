&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:91-a Special Rules Regarding Transfers of Experience and Assignment of Rates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the following shall apply regarding assignment of rates and transfers of experience:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a)(1) If an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion thereof, to an employing unit or to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is any common ownership, management, or control of the 2 employers, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom such business is so transferred.  The rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective following the date of the transfer of trade or business in accordance with such rules as the commissioner may adopt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If, following a transfer of experience under subparagraph (1), the commissioner determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, then the experience rating of the employer accounts involved shall be combined and the combined rate assigned to each employer in accordance with such rules as the commissioner may adopt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whenever a person who is not an employer under this chapter at the time he or she acquires the trade or business, or a portion thereof, of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to such person if the commissioner finds that such person acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions.  Instead, such person shall be assigned the new employer rate under RSA 282-A:81.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In determining whether there is any common ownership, management, or control of 2 employers, the commissioner shall use objective factors which may include the extent of commonality or similarity of:  ownership;  any familial relationships;  principals or corporate officers;  organizational structure;  day-to-day operations;  assets and liabilities;  and stated business purposes.  Ownership of publicly-traded mutual funds, publicly-traded stocks, and similar publicly-traded investments shall not be indicative of common ownership, management, or control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In determining whether a substantial purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, the commissioner shall use objective standards which may include the cost of acquiring the business to which the experience was transferred, how long such business enterprise was continued after the transfer, the extent to which such business enterprise reduced its workforce following the transfer, the size of each employer's workforce before and after the transfer, and the business activity conducted by each employer prior to, and after, the transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the commissioner shall use objective factors which may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long such business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f)(1) If a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate subparagraph (a), (b), or (i) or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate, or if a person knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a violation of such provision, the person shall be subject to the following penalties:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) If the person is an employer, such employer shall be assigned the highest rate assignable under this chapter for the rate year during which such violation or attempted violation occurred and the 3 rate years immediately following this rate year.  However, if the person's business is already at such highest rate for any year, or if the amount of increase in the person's rate would be less than 2 percent for such year, then a penalty rate of contributions of 2 percent of taxable wages shall be imposed for such year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) If the person is not an employer, such person shall be subject to a civil fine of not more than $5,000.  Any such fine shall be deposited in the fund established by RSA 282-A:140.  Such person shall also be jointly and severally liable with any liable employer for additional contributions and all related penalties, fees, interest, and costs owed as a result of the application of this section.  Such person shall be subject to civil action for such liability in any manner provided for collection of contributions in RSA 282-A:141-156.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In addition to other penalties imposed in this paragraph, any violation of this section may be prosecuted under RSA 282-A:166 or any other appropriate statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The commissioner shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a business for purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) For purposes of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Knowingly'' means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the prohibition involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Person'' means "person'' as defined in section 7701(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Trade or business'' includes the employer's workforce.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) "Violates'' or "attempts to violate'' includes, but is not limited to, intent to evade, misrepresentation, and willful nondisclosure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The reporting by an employer of its payroll under the account of another employer with which there is no common ownership, management, or control, is prohibited unless the reporting employer is an employee leasing company lawfully making such report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A management company which contracts with any employer to report wages of managed employees shall be considered, in accordance with such rules as the commissioner may adopt, to have common management or control with such employer, and with any other management company with which the employer may contract for the same purpose in the future.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This section shall be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to meet the minimum requirements contained in any guidance or regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor.
