<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Send to the last employing unit or any employer who was or may be charged with benefits and any employing unit or employer whenever a claimant's reason for leaving their employ may be material to the claim a notice of the filing of a claim advising the employer or employing unit of the material information provided by the claimant and advising the employer or employing unit whether the department will initiate contact with the employer or employing unit to obtain full and complete information or whether the employer or employing unit is required to contact the department to dispute the information provided by the claimant;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Send to the same employing units or employers as in subparagraph (a) an information verification and waiver form as provided in RSA 282-A:50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The notice, request and waiver form provided for in paragraph I may be in one or more forms and shall be as provided for in the rules adopted by the commissioner, including such time limitations as the commissioner deems appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Failure on the part of the employing units or employers to respond in at least one of the methods provided in paragraph I shall, at the expiration of the period set for response, be deemed an irrevocable waiver of its right to be heard before the determination is made.  Benefits charged to its account as a result of the determination shall remain so charged even though the claimant is, by reason of some later decision, held not to be entitled to such benefits.
