If at any time the governor shall find:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. That the provisions of this chapter requiring the payment of contributions and benefits have been held invalid under the constitution of this state by the supreme court of this state or under the United States Constitution by the Supreme Court of the United States in such manner that any person or concern required to pay contributions under this chapter might secure a similar decision, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. That the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, as amended, or any other federal tax against which contributions under this chapter may be credited, has been amended or repealed by Congress or has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States with the result that no portion of the contributions required by this chapter may be credited against such federal tax, the governor shall publicly so proclaim;  and, upon the date of such proclamation, the provisions of this chapter requiring the payment of contributions and benefits shall be suspended.  The commissioner of the department of employment security shall thereupon requisition from the unemployment trust fund all moneys therein standing to its credit and shall direct the state treasurer to deposit such moneys, together with any other moneys, in the fund, as a special fund in any bank or public depositories in this state in which general funds of the state may be deposited, and to hold such moneys for such disposition as the legislature may prescribe.
