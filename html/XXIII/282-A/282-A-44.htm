&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:44 Determination Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A determination shall be a decision by the certifying officer on a claim and shall be made, except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A determination on an initial claim for total or partial benefits for any week shall include:  the maximum duration thereof;  whether or not, with the reasons therefor, the claimant is payable for such week and for consecutive weeks thereafter for which claims are filed (no other fact appearing to the contrary during such period);  and identification of the employer whose account will be charged with benefits to be paid by reason of such determination.  This determination shall in every case be mailed to all interested parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. A determination on the first claim in a benefit year shall be mailed to the claimant and shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The annual earnings in the base period with the name of each employer reporting wages paid to the claimant, and the amount of such wages;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The maximum benefits then available;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The maximum weekly benefit amount and the maximum duration of such weekly benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A determination shall be made by a certifying officer on any claim for benefits, though not an initial claim, if, in his judgment, there appears to be an issue relative to the entitlement of the claimant to benefits.  The determination shall be in the manner provided in paragraph I, and the interested parties shall be notified in the same manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that a determination be made with respect to a claim for any week or where the week is one of any of the consecutive weeks for which benefits are paid immediately following the week with respect to which a determination is made under paragraph I except as provided in paragraph II.
