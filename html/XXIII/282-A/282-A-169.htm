&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:169 Reciprocal Arrangements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner of the department of employment security is hereby authorized to enter into reciprocal arrangements with appropriate and duly authorized agencies of other states or of the federal government, or both, whereby:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Services performed by an individual for a single employing unit for which services are customarily performed by such individual in more than one state shall be deemed to be services performed entirely within any one of the states:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In which any part of such individual's service is performed, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In which such individual has his residence, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In which the employing unit maintains a place of business, provided there is in effect, as to such services, an election by an employing unit with the acquiescence of such individual, approved by the agency charged with the administration of such state's unemployment compensation law, pursuant to which services performed by such individual for such employing unit are deemed to be performed entirely within such state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Potential rights to benefits under this chapter may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits by another state or the federal government, and potential rights to benefits accumulated under the law of another state or the federal government may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits by this state.  Such benefits shall be paid under such provisions of this chapter or under the provisions of the law of such other state or the federal government, or under such combination of the provisions of both laws, as may be agreed upon and which will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.  No such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provision for reimbursement to the fund for such benefits as are paid on the basis of wages and service subject to the law of another state or the federal government, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provision for reimbursement from the fund for such benefits as are paid by another state or the federal government on the basis of wages and service subject to this chapter.  Reimbursements paid from the fund pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be benefits for the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Wages or services, upon the basis of which an individual is entitled or may become entitled to benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the federal government, shall be deemed to be wages for insured work for the purpose of determining his rights to benefits under this chapter;  and wages for insured work, on the basis of which an individual is entitled or may become entitled to benefits under this chapter, shall be deemed to be wages or services on the basis of which unemployment compensation is payable under such law of another state or of the federal government;  but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provisions for reimbursements to the fund for such of the benefits paid under this chapter upon the basis of such wages or services, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provisions for reimbursements from the fund for such of the compensation paid under such other law upon the basis of wages for insured work, as the commissioner of the department of employment security finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Contributions due under this chapter with respect to wages for insured work shall for the purposes of RSA 282-A:141-156 be deemed to have been paid to the fund as of the date payment was made as contributions therefor under another state or federal unemployment compensation law, but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains provisions for such reimbursement to the fund of such contributions as the commissioner of the department of employment security finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department of employment security may administer, at no cost to this state, as an agent of the United States of America, employment security and related programs authorized by the Congress of the United States and, pursuant thereto, may receive and disburse federally granted moneys.  All the power and authority otherwise granted in this chapter to the commissioner shall equally apply under this provision.  The commissioner may create outside the state treasury such special funds, the moneys in which shall not lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund, except as permitted by federal law, as he determines necessary to carry out the purposes of this provision.  Moneys granted by the federal government for payment of department personnel salaries and expenses, supplies, equipment and rent and such other expenses as are approved by the federal agency to carry out any agreement shall be deposited in the unemployment compensation and employment service administration fund provided by this chapter.  The treasurer, as provided in RSA 282-A:103-106, shall be the treasurer of such fund as is created hereunder, and it shall be safeguarded in such manner as may be required by federal law.  The cost of any bond required by any federal agency shall be paid from the unemployment compensation and employment service administration fund created by this chapter.
