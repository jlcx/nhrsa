&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 282-A:91 Successorship;  Total Acquisition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
An employing unit which acquires substantially all of the New Hampshire assets of any employer with the intent to continue said employer's organization, trade or business, excepting, in any such case, any assets retained by such employer incident to the liquidation of his obligations (whether or not such acquiring employing unit was an employing unit within the meaning of this chapter prior to such acquisition), shall within 30 days notify the commissioner thereof and shall assume, for the purpose of liability, the position of such employer with respect to such employer's separate account and contribution liability as if no change with respect to such separate account and liability had occurred and with the same effect for such purpose as if the operations of such employer had at all times been carried on by such employing unit.  Such separate account shall be transferred by the commissioner to such employing unit and, as of the date of such acquisition, shall become the separate account or part of the separate account, as the case may be, of such employing unit.  The benefits thereafter chargeable to such employer on account of employment prior to the date of such acquisition shall be charged to the former employer's separate account until the fact of successorship is determined by the commissioner and thereafter shall be charged to the account of the acquiring employing unit.
