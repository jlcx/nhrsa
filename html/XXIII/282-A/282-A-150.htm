&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the commissioner believes that the collection of contributions will be jeopardized by delay, he shall immediately assess on the basis of whatever information he may have such contributions together with all interest and penalties, whether or not the time prescribed by RSA 282-A:69 through 98 and this subdivision or by the rules adopted by the commissioner for making return and paying such contributions has expired.  Such contributions, interest and penalties shall thereupon become immediately due and payable;  and immediate notice and demand, either in person or in writing, shall be made by the commissioner or his duly authorized representatives for the payment thereof.  Upon failure or refusal to pay immediately such contributions, interest and penalties, collection thereof by any means provided in this subdivision shall be lawful without regard to the period prescribed in RSA 282-A:151 or by the rules of the commissioner and proceedings may also be instituted under RSA 282-A:161-168 for such failure or refusal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The collection of the whole or any part of the amount of such assessment may be stayed by filing with the commissioner a bond in such amount as is equal to the amount to which the stay is desired and with such sureties as the commissioner deems necessary conditioned on payment of the amount collection of which is stayed, at the time at which, but for this section, such amount would be due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An assessment under this section shall not finally fix the amount of such contributions, interest and penalties.  Where the amount due is subsequently discovered to be greater than that assessed, the balance shall be collected by any means provided in this subdivision.  If the amount due is subsequently discovered to be less than that assessed, it shall be adjusted in the manner provided by RSA 282-A:149.
