&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 270-D:14 Temporary Certificate. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner, or designee, shall issue a temporary certificate of safe boating education to a person 16 years of age or older who passes a temporary safe boater examination administered by the department or its agents and approved by the commissioner.  The temporary certificate of safe boater education shall be valid for up to 14 days and shall entitle the holder only to operate a vessel on the public waters of New Hampshire.  No person shall receive more than one temporary certificate of safe boating education in any calendar year.  Any dealer or renter of boats or employee thereof, who has passed the boating safety education course as provided in RSA 270-D:13, I(a) and is approved by the commissioner, may administer the temporary safety examination and issue a temporary certificate.  If the commissioner finds that a person administering a temporary safe boater examination has assisted the person taking the examination, the commissioner shall permanently revoke the authority of the administrator to issue certificates and administer examinations.
