<codesect>
It is the intent of the general court in this chapter to establish a uniform fee structure and numbering system for all boats using the public waters of the state of New Hampshire, which includes inland waters as well as tidal and coastal waters.  This chapter specifies which boats are subject to the boat fee and registration fee, how these revenues are to be allocated and used, and how the registration numbers are displayed.
