<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director or the director's agent may use stationary sound level testing to determine marine engine noise levels for boats.  Such testing shall be conducted while boats are stationary on the water according to test SAE J2005.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Noise levels in decibels for stationary sound level testing shall be established for a specific distance between the boat tested and the testing device, at levels which correlate with noise levels in decibels, as set forth in RSA 270:37.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Testing procedures for stationary sound level testing shall be measured according to procedures established pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 270:39.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any test conducted pursuant to this section shall be sufficient to establish a violation of RSA 270:37.
