&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 270:60 Statement of Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Water is a public resource held in trust by the state and that the state maintains jurisdiction to control the use of public waters for the greatest public benefit;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The public waters are a significant asset which enhance the well-being and lifestyle of the state's citizens, benefit the state's substantial tourist industry and the environment, and are a habitat for many fish and wildlife;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That undue proliferation of moorings is detrimental to the integrity of the state's waters and the public's enjoyment thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court intends to establish through this subdivision a means of regulating the usage of moorings on public waters.  Existing moorings may be permitted in their existing locations, provided such moorings comply with the provisions of this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The general court does not intend, by passage of this legislation, to convey to, create for, or recognize any rights of shorefront property owners.
