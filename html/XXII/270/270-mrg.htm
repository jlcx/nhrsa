&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 270:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the interest of public safety and the protection of property, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of safety, in all cases not provided for by the United States inspection laws and in all cases in which inspections are not regularly made thereunder, to provide for the inspection on any public waters of the state of all commercial and private boats and the machinery, appliances, and equipment thereof, such inspections to be performed by said commissioner of safety or his duly authorized representative.  Said commissioner of safety shall also supervise the safety of navigation and the establishment of aids to navigation, and all lights and buoys maintained at public expense on the inland waters of the state shall be under the jurisdiction of said commissioner of safety.  Said commissioner of safety shall make such alterations and improvements in existing lights and buoys as may be desirable, place additional lights and buoys where required to promote the safety of navigation, remove obstructions tending to impede navigation, and maintain all lights and buoys under its jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the interest of maintaining the residential, recreational and scenic values which New Hampshire public waters provide to residents of the state and to the promotion of our tourist industry, and in light of the fact that competing uses for the enjoyment of these waters, if not regulated for the benefit of all users, may diminish the value to be derived from them, it is hereby declared that the public waters of New Hampshire shall be maintained and regulated in such way as to provide for the safe and mutual enjoyment of a variety of uses, both from the shore and from water-borne conveyances.  Such provisions shall take into consideration the following:  the variety of special uses appropriate to our lakes, public safety, protection of environment and water quality, and the continued nurture of New Hampshire's threatened and endangered species.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is the intent of the legislature to recognize in RSA 270:42-46 that the cumulative effect of boats congregated as "rafts'' differs from that of the same number of boats scattered and, therefore, requires specific appropriate regulation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The operator of a vessel who knows or reasonably should have known that he or she has just been involved in any accident that involved death, personal injury, or damage to property, shall immediately stop said vessel at the scene of the accident, render any assistance that he or she is capable of giving to the occupants of any other vessel involved in the accident, and give the operator or owner of any other vessel involved in such accident, and to any person injured, and to the owner of any property damaged, the operator's name and the owner's name and address, the vessel registration number, and the name and address of each occupant.  If by reason of injury or absence or removal from the place of the accident or other cause, such injured person, or operator of such other vessel, or owner of the property damaged, or any of them, is unable to understand or receive the information required in this section, such information shall be given to any marine patrol officer or other police officer with jurisdiction arriving at the scene of the accident or immediately to a marine patrol officer or other police officer at the nearest police station or at marine patrol headquarters.  Any person operating a vessel that is in any manner involved in the accident shall, within 15 days after such accident, report in writing to the department of safety the facts required hereunder together with a statement of the circumstances if any person is injured or killed or if damage to property is in excess of $2,000.  If the operator is physically or mentally incapable of making such report, the owner of the vessel involved in the accident or the owner's representative shall, after learning of the accident, forthwith make such report.  The operator or the owner shall furnish to the department such relevant information as the department shall require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All law enforcement agencies having knowledge of a drowning or boating accident shall have a duty to report any personal injury resulting from a boating accident, death or drowning including suspected drowning, and all boating accidents wherein there is resulting damage of $2,000 or more, immediately, to the commissioner of safety or the commissioner's authorized representative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It shall be the responsibility of the commissioner of safety and the commissioner's authorized representative to investigate any drowning or suspected drowning and all accidents in which there is serious injury, death, or property damage of $2,000 or more.  Said investigation shall be in addition to, and independent of, any investigation made by other agencies of government, except that said agencies may exchange data and cooperate with each other to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Jurisdiction for the purposes of this section shall extend to all waters under the jurisdiction of the state of New Hampshire.

I. The commissioner of safety shall, after receiving a petition signed by 25 or more residents or property owners of each affected town or towns in which a lake, pond or river is located and after notice and hearing, at which it appears that the public interest requires, adopt rules governing the maximum horsepower of boat engines and outboard motors or prescribe maximum speed limits for the operation of such boats or outboard motors applicable to or upon all or any portion of the public waters of this state.  The commissioner of safety shall, in like manner and after notice and hearing, prohibit the use of motorboats and outboard motors on bodies of public water having an area of 35 acres or less;  provided, that said prohibition shall not be construed as affecting the bodies of water covered by RSA 270:75 through 270:132.

IV. In this section, "abutter'' means any person who owns property immediately adjacent and contiguous to the area on which the change of use or restriction of use will take place.  If the change of use or restriction of use is located in an area which by its configuration would cause the change or restriction to affect noncontiguous properties, owners of those properties are considered as abutters.  The term does not include the owner of a parcel of land located more than  1/4 mile from the limits of the proposed change or restriction.
