&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When there is a change to any of the information that a sexual offender or offender against children is required to report pursuant to this chapter, the offender shall give written notification of the new information to the local law enforcement agency to which he or she last reported under RSA 651-B:4 within 5 business days of such change of information.  In addition, any time a sex offender or offender against children changes residence, employment, or schooling, the offender shall report in person to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the offender's previous place of residence, place of employment, or school within 5 business days.  The local law enforcement agency receiving notice of the change of registration information shall forward a copy to the division within 5 days after receipt.  The division shall notify the local law enforcement agency at the new place of residence, place of employment, or school, or the appropriate out-of-state law enforcement agency if the new place of residence, place of employment, or school is outside New Hampshire.

Upon receipt of notice that an offender has changed residence, employment, or schooling to a place outside New Hampshire, the division shall notify the appropriate out-of-state law enforcement agency of that information.  Within 10 business days after reporting the change of residence, employment, or schooling to the New Hampshire law enforcement agency, the offender shall report to the appropriate out-of-state law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the new place of residence, place of employment, or school.  If the offender fails to report to the appropriate out-of-state law enforcement agency the division shall maintain the offender's information in the SOR system.

I. All tier II or tier III offenders shall be registered for life.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a)(1) All tier III offenders shall remain on the public list contained in RSA 651-B:7 for life.

The petition shall not be filed prior to the completion of all the terms and conditions of the sentence and in no case earlier than 15 years after the date of release.  The petition shall be accompanied by a risk assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist at the offender's expense.  The court may grant the petition if the offender has not been convicted of any felony, class A misdemeanor, sex offense, or offense against a child, has successfully completed any periods of supervised release, probation, or parole, and has successfully completed an appropriate sex offender treatment program as determined by the court.  If the court denies the petition, the offender shall not file another petition for 5 years from the date of denial.

The victim may appear personally, or by counsel, or may provide a written statement to reasonably express his or her views concerning the offense, the person responsible, and the need for maintaining the registration requirement.  The judge shall consider the statements of the victim pursuant to this section when making a decision regarding the application.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Registration of any juvenile required to register pursuant to RSA 651-B:1, XI(a)(3) or (4) shall end when the juvenile turns 17 years of age unless the court which adjudicated the juvenile as a delinquent retains jurisdiction over the juvenile pursuant to RSA 169-B:4, V, in which case registration of the juvenile shall end when the court terminates jurisdiction over the juvenile's case.

I.

The offender shall, within 10 days of notification, request a hearing on the matter before the commissioner.  If such a request is made, the commissioner shall promptly schedule and conduct a hearing pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 541-A.

In determining whether the offender should be required to register, the court may consider the facts of underlying the out-of-state conviction, the offender's prior criminal history, the extent to which public safety would be furthered by requiring the offender to register, and any other relevant information.  If the court determines that the offender is required to register, the court shall determine whether the offender is required to register as a tier I, tier II, or tier III offender.  In determining the appropriate tier, the court shall consider the nature of other offenses that are currently listed in each tier, the seriousness of the offender's offense, the extent to which public safety would be furthered, whether the victim was a minor when the offense occurred, and any other relevant factors.  The hearing at which such a determination is made shall comply with due process requirements, including a right to appeal the findings.

No application shall be granted without a hearing, during which the prosecuting attorney and the victim or victim's family shall have an opportunity to be heard.  Notice of the hearing shall be provided no less than 30 days prior to the hearing.  The victim may appear personally or through a representative, and may reasonably express his or her views concerning the offense, the offender, and the need for continuing the registration requirement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651-B:11 Registration Fee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An offender shall pay a fee of $50 to the department within 10 days of the registration that occurs within the month of the anniversary of his or her birth.  Such payment shall be made in person or shall be mailed to the department.  The department shall retain $40 of this amount to be used to defray the costs of maintaining the sex offender registry.  Such funds shall be nonlapsing and shall be continually appropriated to the department for such use.  The department shall forward the remaining $10 to the law enforcement agency which registered the offender within the month of the anniversary of the offender's birth to defray any costs associated with implementing the provisions of this chapter.  The department shall forward these fees to the registering law enforcement agencies in a manner determined by the department but no less frequently than once a year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An offender who cannot afford to pay the fee shall, within 10 days of registration, request a waiver of the fee and a hearing on the matter before the commissioner.  In order to be considered for a waiver, the offender shall submit a financial affidavit on a form provided by the department.  The division may at its discretion request such a waiver on behalf of an offender.  If such a request is made, the commissioner shall promptly schedule and conduct a hearing pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 541-A, unless the commissioner or commissioner's designee determines a hearing is not necessary and waives the fee based on the offender's financial affidavit, or at the written request of the division.  At the hearing, the burden shall be on the offender to prove that he or she is indigent.  The offender may appeal the commissioner's decision to the superior court.  Under no circumstances shall the offender's request for a hearing or indigency relieve the offender of the obligation to register as required pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding RSA 651-B:9, an offender who violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a violation for a first offense and a misdemeanor for a second or subsequent offense.
