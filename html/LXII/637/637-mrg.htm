&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 637:2 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following definitions are applicable to this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Property'' means anything of value, including real estate, tangible and intangible personal property, captured or domestic animals and birds, written instruments or other writings representing or embodying rights concerning real or personal property, labor, services, or otherwise containing any thing of value to the owner, commodities of a public utility nature such as telecommunications, gas, electricity, steam, or water, and trade secrets, meaning the whole or any portion of any scientific or technical information, design, process, procedure, formula or invention which the owner thereof intends to be available only to persons selected by him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Obtain'' means, in relation to property, to bring about a transfer of possession or of some other legally recognized interest in property, whether to the obtainer or another;  in relation to labor or services, to secure performance thereof;  and in relation to a trade secret, to make any facsimile, replica, photograph or other reproduction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Purpose to deprive'' means to have the conscious object:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To withhold property permanently or for so extended a period or to use under such circumstances that a substantial portion of its economic value, or of the use and benefit thereof, would be lost;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To restore the property only upon payment of a reward or other compensation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To dispose of the property under circumstances that make it unlikely that the owner will recover it;  or

(d) To appropriate the goods or merchandise of a merchant without paying the merchant's stated or advertised price.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Property of another'' includes property in which any person other than the actor has an interest which the actor is not privileged to infringe, regardless of the fact that the actor also has an interest in the property and regardless of the fact that the other person might be precluded from civil recovery because the property was used in an unlawful transaction or was subject to forfeiture as contraband.  Property in possession of the actor shall not be deemed property of another who has only a security interest therein, even if legal title is in the creditor pursuant to a conditional sales contract or other security agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Value'' means the highest amount determined by any reasonable standard of property or services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Amounts involved in thefts committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The value of property or services obtained by the actor shall determine the grade of the offense, and such value shall not be offset against or reduced by the value of any property or services given by the actor in exchange.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each personal check or credit card shall have a value of $250.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Merchant'' means the owner or operator of any place of business where merchandise is displayed, held, or stored, for sale to the public, or any agent or employee of such owner or operator.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 637:4 Theft by Deception. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person commits theft if he obtains or exercises control over property of another by deception and with a purpose to deprive him thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, deception occurs when a person purposely:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Creates or reinforces an impression which is false and which that person does not believe to be true, including false impressions as to law, value, knowledge, opinion, intention or other state of mind.  Provided, however, that an intention not to perform a promise, or knowledge that it will not be performed, shall not be inferred from the fact alone that the promise was not performed;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fails to correct a false impression which he previously had created or reinforced and which he did not believe to be true, or which he knows to be influencing another to whom he stands in a fiduciary or confidential relationship;  or
<br>

(c) Prevents another from acquiring information which is pertinent to the disposition of the property involved;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Fails to disclose a known lien, adverse claim or other legal impediment to the enjoyment of property which he transfers or encumbers in consideration for the property obtained, whether such impediment is or is not valid, or is or is not a matter of official record;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Misrepresents to or misleads any person, in any manner, so as to make that person believe that the person on whose behalf a solicitation or sales promotion is being conducted is a charitable trust or that the proceeds of such solicitation or sales promotion shall be used for charitable purposes, if such is not the fact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Theft by deception does not occur, however, when there is only falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or puffing by statements unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed.  "Puffing'' means an exaggerated commendation of wares in communications addressed to the public or to a class or group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A person commits theft under this section notwithstanding that the victim has suffered no actual or net pecuniary loss.
