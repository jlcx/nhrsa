&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person commits theft if he obtains or exercises control over property of another by deception and with a purpose to deprive him thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, deception occurs when a person purposely:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Creates or reinforces an impression which is false and which that person does not believe to be true, including false impressions as to law, value, knowledge, opinion, intention or other state of mind.  Provided, however, that an intention not to perform a promise, or knowledge that it will not be performed, shall not be inferred from the fact alone that the promise was not performed;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fails to correct a false impression which he previously had created or reinforced and which he did not believe to be true, or which he knows to be influencing another to whom he stands in a fiduciary or confidential relationship;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Prevents another from acquiring information which is pertinent to the disposition of the property involved;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Fails to disclose a known lien, adverse claim or other legal impediment to the enjoyment of property which he transfers or encumbers in consideration for the property obtained, whether such impediment is or is not valid, or is or is not a matter of official record;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Misrepresents to or misleads any person, in any manner, so as to make that person believe that the person on whose behalf a solicitation or sales promotion is being conducted is a charitable trust or that the proceeds of such solicitation or sales promotion shall be used for charitable purposes, if such is not the fact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Theft by deception does not occur, however, when there is only falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or puffing by statements unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed.  "Puffing'' means an exaggerated commendation of wares in communications addressed to the public or to a class or group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A person commits theft under this section notwithstanding that the victim has suffered no actual or net pecuniary loss.
