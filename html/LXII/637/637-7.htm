&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 637:7 Receiving Stolen Property. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person commits theft if he receives, retains, or disposes of the property of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it has probably been stolen, with a purpose to deprive the owner thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The knowledge or belief required for paragraph I is presumed in the case of a dealer who:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is found in possession or control of property stolen from 2 or more persons on separate occasions;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Has received other stolen property within the year preceding the receiving charged;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Being a dealer in property of the sort received, retained or disposed, acquires it for a consideration which he knows is far below its reasonable value, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Purchases property from a law enforcement officer working in an undercover capacity, or an agent of such law enforcement officer, where such property has been explicitly represented as stolen.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As used in this section, "receives'' means acquiring possession, control or title or lending on the security of the property;  and "dealer'' means a person in the business of buying or selling goods.
