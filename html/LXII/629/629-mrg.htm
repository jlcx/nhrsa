<center><h3>Section 629:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 629:1 Attempt. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, with a purpose that a crime be committed, he does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the crime.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. As used in this section, "substantial step'' means conduct that is strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the actor voluntarily renounces his criminal purpose by abandoning his effort to commit the crime or otherwise preventing its commission under circumstances manifesting a complete withdrawal of his criminal purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A renunciation is not "voluntary'' if it is substantially motivated by circumstances the defendant was not aware of at the inception of his conduct which increase the probability of his detection or which make more difficult the commission of the crime.  Renunciation is not complete if the purpose is to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The penalty for attempt is the same as that authorized for the crime that was attempted, except that in the case of attempt to commit murder the punishment shall be imprisonment for life or such other term as the court shall order.

I. A person is guilty of criminal solicitation if, with a purpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime, he commands, solicits or requests such other person to engage in such conduct.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the actor renounced his criminal purpose by persuading the other not to engage in the criminal conduct or by otherwise preventing commission of the crime under circumstances manifesting a purpose that it not occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is no defense to prosecution under this section that the person solicited would be immune from liability for engaging in the criminal conduct by virtue of irresponsibility, incapacity or exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The penalty for criminal solicitation is the same as that authorized for the crime that was solicited, except that in the case of solicitation of murder the punishment shall be imprisonment for a term of not more than 30 years.
