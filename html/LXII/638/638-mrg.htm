<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person is guilty of issuing a bad check if he issues or passes a check for the payment of money and payment is refused by the drawee, except in cases where a legal stop payment order has been issued or where the drawee refuses payment for any other reason through no fault of the person who issued or passed the check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. A person who issues or passes a bad check is subject to prosecution in the jurisdiction in which he issued or passed the check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, as well as in any prosecution for theft committed by means of a bad check, a person who issues a check for which payment is refused by the drawee is presumed to know that such check would not be paid if he had no account with the drawee at the time of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is an affirmative defense that the actor paid the amount of the check, together with all costs and protest fees, to the person to whom it was due, within 14 days after having received notice that payment was refused.  The actor's failure to make such payment within 14 days after receiving notice that payment was refused shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of paragraph I of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Issuing a bad check is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A class A felony if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The face amount of the check exceeds $1,500;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The defendant has 2 or more prior convictions under this section, the present and prior convictions were based on offenses committed within a 12-month period, and the aggregate face amount of the checks underlying the present and prior convictions exceeds $1,500;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A class B felony if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The face amount of the check exceeds $1,000 but is not more than $1,500;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The defendant has 2 or more prior convictions under this section, the present and prior convictions were based on offenses committed within a 12-month period, and the aggregate face amount of the checks underlying the present and prior convictions exceeds $1,000 but does not exceed $1,500;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A class A misdemeanor if the face amount of the check does not exceed $1,000 and the actor has been convicted of an offense under this section within the previous 12 months;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A class B misdemeanor in all other cases.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In any prosecution under subparagraph IV(a), the prosecutor shall prove that the person issued or passed the check knowing or believing that the check would not be paid by the drawee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Face amounts involved in the issuance of bad checks committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to any other sentence which it imposes, the court shall, if restitution is authorized under RSA 651:63, order any person convicted of a violation of this section to make restitution to the person to whom the check was due.  Such restitution shall include the amount of the check and may include all reasonable costs and protest fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in any judicial proceeding under this section, a notarized or sworn statement by the bank official who is the keeper of records of the bank upon which the check was drawn shall be admissible as evidence at trial to prove the status or account balance of the person's account on the date the check was issued or passed.  The admission of this statement shall eliminate the need for the keeper of records to personally appear and testify before the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the person who issued the check for which payment was refused from securing the appearance of the keeper of the records before the court by subpoena or other legal process.

Each individual good bearing or identified by a counterfeit mark shall constitute a separate offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Evidence that a person had possession, custody, or control of more than 25 items bearing a counterfeit mark shall be prima facie evidence that the person had possession with the intent to sell or distribute the items.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any goods that bear or consist of a counterfeit mark used in committing a violation of this section shall be subject to forfeiture to the state of New Hampshire and no property right shall exist in such property.  At the conclusion of all criminal proceedings, the court shall order such items be destroyed or disposed of in another manner with the written consent of the trademark owner.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Pursuant to a search warrant or seizure warrant on an affidavit under oath demonstrating that probable cause exists for its forfeiture;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Physically, on probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Constructively, on probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture under this section, by recording a notice of pending forfeiture in the registry of deeds in the county where the real property is located or at the town clerk's office where the person's property is located stating that the state intends to seek forfeiture of the identified property pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A seizure for forfeiture without process under subparagraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) shall be reasonable if made under circumstances in which a warrantless seizure or arrest would be valid in accordance with state law.

(d) The seizing agency shall notify the defendant within 7 days of any seizure of property of its intent to forfeit the property pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The forfeiture of any property or item under this paragraph shall be governed by RSA 595-A:6.  The state shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture.  Except in the case of proceeds, upon a finding that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall determine whether the forfeiture of the property is not excessive in relation to the underlying criminal offense.  In making this determination, the court shall consider whether in addition to any pertinent considerations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) There is a substantial connection between the property to be forfeited and the underlying offense;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Criminal activities conducted by or through the use of the property were extensive;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The value of the property to be forfeited greatly outweighs the cost of prosecution and the harm caused by the criminal conduct.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Final orders for forfeiture shall be implemented by the seizing agency and all proceeds of the forfeiture shall go to that agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) At the request of any party to the forfeiture proceeding, the court shall grant a continuance until the final resolution of any criminal proceedings which were brought against a party under this section and which arose from the transaction which gave rise to the forfeiture proceeding.  No party's interest in property shall be forfeited unless a party has been found guilty of the underlying charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The court may order a person convicted under this section to pay restitution pursuant to RSA 651:63 to the trademark owner and to any other person the court may determine.  Any restitution ordered by the court shall include, but is not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, and any other expenses incurred by the trademark owner in the investigation and prosecution of the case.
