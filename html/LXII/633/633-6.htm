In this subdivision:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Commercial sex act'' means any sex act because of which anything of value is given, promised to, or received, directly or indirectly, by any person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Sex act'' means any act of sexual contact as defined in RSA 632-A:1, IV, any act of sexual penetration as defined in RSA 632-A:1, V, or any other sexually explicit conduct as defined in RSA 649-A:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Sexually-explicit performance'' means an act or show involving one or more sex acts, intended to arouse, satisfy the sexual desires of, or appeal to the prurient interests of patrons or viewers, whether public or private, live, photographed, recorded, or videotaped.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Serious harm'' includes physical and non-physical harm.  It can be any improper threat of a consequence sufficient under the circumstances to compel or coerce a reasonable person in the same situation to provide or continue to provide labor or services, or to engage in commercial sex acts or sexually explicit performances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Involuntary servitude'' means a condition of compulsory service or labor, including commercial sex acts or sexually explicit performances, performed by one person, against his or her will, for the benefit of another.  If a person willingly begins to perform the labor or service but later attempts to withdraw and is forced to remain and perform against his or her will, the service becomes involuntary.  The payment of a wage or salary is not determinative of the question as to whether that person has been held in involuntary servitude.
