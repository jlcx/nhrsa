<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whoever commits any of the following acts against an elderly, disabled, or impaired adult, as defined in RSA 631:8, shall be guilty of financial exploitation and penalized pursuant to RSA 631:10 if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In breach of a fiduciary obligation recognized in law, including pertinent regulations, contractual obligations, documented consent by a competent person, including, but not limited to, an agent under a durable power of attorney, guardian, conservator, or trustee, a person, knowingly or recklessly, for his or her own profit or advantage:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Fails to use the real or personal property or other financial resources of the elderly, disabled, or impaired adult to provide food, clothing, shelter, health care, therapeutic conduct, or supervision for the elderly, disabled, or impaired adult when under a duty to do so;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless authorized by the instrument establishing fiduciary obligation, deprives, uses, manages, or takes either temporarily or permanently the real or personal property or other financial resources of the elderly, disabled, or impaired adult for the benefit of someone other than the elderly, disabled, or impaired adult;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the absence of legal authority a person knowingly or recklessly through the use of undue influence, harassment, duress, force, compulsion, or coercion:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Acquires possession or control of an interest in real or personal property or other financial resources of an elderly, disabled, or impaired adult;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Induces an elderly, disabled, or impaired adult against the elderly, disabled, or impaired adult's will to perform services for the profit or advantage of another;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Establishes a relationship with a fiduciary obligation to an elderly, disabled, or impaired adult that gives the person control of an interest in real or personal property or other financial resources of an elderly, disabled, or impaired adult.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. State and local law enforcement agencies shall have concurrent jurisdiction to investigate reports of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of incapacitated adults as defined in RSA 161-F or RSA 464-A and all other crimes against elderly, disabled, or impaired adult victims including, but not limited to, the crimes set forth in RSA 631:8 and this section.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to alter the duties and responsibilities of the commissioner of the department of health and human services, or his or her designees, relative to investigating reports of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation of incapacitated adults pursuant to RSA 161-F.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section requires a health or residential care facility, licensed under RSA 151, or any person to provide financial management or supervise financial management for an elderly, disabled, or impaired adult except as otherwise required by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the person knew or had reason to know that the elderly, disabled, or impaired adult lacked capacity to consent, consent is not a defense to a violation of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose criminal liability on a person who makes a good faith effort to assist an elderly, disabled, or impaired adult in the management of funds, assets, or property which effort fails through no fault of the person.
