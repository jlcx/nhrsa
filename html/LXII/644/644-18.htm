&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if such person owns or has control of the occupied structure, dwelling, or curtilage, where a drug or underage alcohol house party is held and such person knowingly commits an overt act in furtherance of the occurrence of the drug or underage alcohol house party knowing persons under the age of 21 possess or intend to consume alcoholic beverages or use controlled drugs at such drug or underage alcohol house party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section if a person gives timely notice to a law enforcement official of the occurrence of the drug or underage alcohol house party or engages in other conduct designed to prevent the occurrence of such party, or takes action to terminate such party once underway.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In this section, "drug or underage alcohol house party'' means a gathering of 5 or more people under the age of 21 at any occupied structure, dwelling, or curtilage, who are unrelated to the person who owns such occupied structure, dwelling, or curtilage or has control thereof, where at least one person under the age of 21 unlawfully possesses or consumes an alcoholic beverage or controlled drug.  "Occupied structure'' has the same meaning as in RSA 635:1, and "dwelling'' and "curtilage'' have the same meaning as in RSA 627:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the use of alcoholic beverages at legally protected religious observances or activities, or to those persons using a controlled drug under a physician's care where the use of the drug is consistent with the directions of a physician.
