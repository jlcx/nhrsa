(c) He assembles with 2 or more other persons with the purpose of committing an offense against the person or property of another whom he supposes to be guilty of a violation of the law, believing that 2 or more other persons in the assembly have the same purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who refuses to comply with a lawful order to withdraw given to him immediately prior to, during, or immediately following a violation of paragraph I is guilty of riot.

Otherwise, it is a misdemeanor.
<br>
