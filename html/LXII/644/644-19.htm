<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Motion picture theater'' means a movie theater, screening room, or other venue that is being utilized primarily for the exhibition of a motion picture at the time of the offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who knowingly operates the audiovisual recording function of any device in a motion picture theater, while a motion picture is being exhibited and without the written consent of the motion picture theater owner, commits a crime punishable as provided in paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unauthorized operation of a recording device shall be a class A misdemeanor for a first offense and a class B felony for a second or subsequent offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This section does not prevent any lawfully authorized investigative, law enforcement, protective, or intelligence gathering employee or agent, of the local, state, or federal government or a duly authorized private investigator, from operating any audiovisual recording device in a motion picture theater, as part of lawfully authorized investigative, protective, law enforcement, or intelligence gathering activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. This section does not apply to a person who operates the audiovisual recording function of a device in a retail establishment solely to demonstrate the use of that device for sales purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
