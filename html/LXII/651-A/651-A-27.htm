&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651-A:27 Interstate Commission Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The compacting states hereby create the interstate commission for adult offender supervision.  The interstate commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the compacting states.  The interstate commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, including the power to sue and be sued, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The interstate commission shall consist of commissioners selected and appointed by resident members of a state council for interstate adult offender supervision for each state.  While each member state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims groups and compact administrators.  Each state council shall appoint as its commissioner the compact administrator from that state to serve on the interstate commission in such capacity under or pursuant to applicable law of the member state.  Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator who shall be appointed by the state council or by the governor in consultation with the legislature and the judiciary.  In addition to appointment of its' commissioner to the National Interstate Commission, each state council shall exercise oversight and advocacy concerning its participation in interstate commission activities and other duties as may be determined by each member state, including but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the interstate commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners but who are members of interested organizations;  such non-commissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general and crime victims.  All non-commissioner members of the interstate commission shall be ex-officio, non-voting members.  The interstate commission may provide in its bylaws for such additional, ex-officio, non-voting members as it deems necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Each compacting state represented at any meeting of the interstate commission is entitled to one vote.  A majority of the compacting states shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the interstate commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The interstate commission shall meet at least once each calendar year.  The chairperson may call additional meetings and, upon the request of 27 or more compacting states, shall call additional meetings.  Public notice shall be given of all meetings and meetings shall be open to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The interstate commission shall establish an executive committee which shall include commission officers, members and others as shall be determined by the bylaws.  The executive committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the interstate commission during periods when the interstate commission is not in session, with the exception of rulemaking and/or amendment to the compact.  The executive committee oversees the day-to-day activities managed by the executive director and interstate commission staff;  administers enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and as directed by the interstate commission and performs other duties as directed by the commission or set forth in the bylaws.
