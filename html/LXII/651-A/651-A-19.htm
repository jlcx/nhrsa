&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651-A:19 Effect of Recommittal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A prisoner who is recommitted shall serve 90 days in prison before being placed back on parole or the remainder of his or her maximum sentence, whichever is shorter, or may be subject to an extended term of recommittal pursuant to paragraphs III and IV.  The time between the return of the parolee to prison after arrest and revocation of parole shall be considered as time served as a portion of the maximum sentence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Prisoners who are recommitted shall be provided access to focused, evidence-based programming aimed at reengaging parolees in their parole plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The parole board may impose an extended term of recommittal for greater than 90 days if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The prisoner has previously been recommitted for a parole violation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prisoner was on parole for a sexual offense as defined in RSA 651-B:1, V or an offense against a child as defined in RSA 651-B:1, VII;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The conduct underlying the parole violation is related to his or her offense or offending pattern;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The prisoner has displayed a combination of dynamic risk factors, including but not limited to, homelessness, loss of supports, substance abuse, or non-compliance with treatment, as determined by the department of corrections sexual offender treatment program staff;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Both subparagraphs (1) and (2);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The prisoner was on parole for a violent crime as defined in RSA 651:5, XIII;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The nature of the conduct underlying the parole violation constitutes a criminal act or is otherwise so serious as to warrant an extended period of recommittal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) A prisoner may be brought before the parole board at any time during the 90-day term of recommittal to determine whether a longer term is warranted if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The prisoner did not meaningfully participate in the evidence-based programming during the 90-day recommittal period;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The prisoner received one or more major disciplinary violations during the 90-day recommittal period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prisoner shall be provided notice of the hearing and the basis of the parole board's consideration of an extended term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The imposition of an extended term of recommittal pursuant to paragraph III or IV shall be supported by written findings and a written order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any prisoner who is subject to an extended term of recommittal shall, upon request, be entitled to a hearing before the parole board after serving 6 months of his or her term of recommittal and every 6 months thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. At the revocation hearing, the parole board may impose a term of recommittal for less than 90 days if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The prisoner has not been previously recommitted for a parole violation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prisoner was not on parole for a sexual offense as defined in RSA 651-B:1, V or an offense against a child as defined in RSA 651-B:1, VII;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The prisoner was not on parole for a violent crime as defined in RSA 651:5, XIII;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The parole violation is not substantially related to his or her offense or offending pattern;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The parole board determines that a lesser period of recommittal will aid in the rehabilitation of the parolee.
