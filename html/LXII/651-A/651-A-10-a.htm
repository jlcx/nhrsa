<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the recommendation of the commissioner of the department of corrections and the administrative director of forensic and medical services, after review of the information provided by a physician licensed pursuant to RSA 329, the parole board may grant medical parole to an inmate residing in a state correctional facility, regardless of the time remaining on his or her sentence, provided all of the following conditions apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The inmate has a terminal, debilitating, incapacitating, or incurable medical condition or syndrome, as certified by a physician licensed pursuant to RSA 329, and, if requested by the parole board, at least one additional physician licensed pursuant to RSA 329.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The cost of medical care, treatment, and resources for the inmate is determined to be excessive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The parole board has determined that there is a reasonable probability that the inmate will not violate the law while on medical parole and will conduct himself or herself as a good citizen.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The administrative director of forensic and medical services, on behalf of an inmate, may petition the parole board for hearing to determine if the inmate is eligible for medical parole and if the inmate is eligible, shall submit the parole plan to the parole board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Medical parole shall be granted by a majority vote of the members of the hearing panel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The parole board may request, as a condition of medical parole, that such inmate submit to periodic medical examinations while on medical parole and comply with any other parole conditions imposed by the parole board.  The administrative director of forensic and medical services, after review of any such medical examination shall report the findings to the parole board.  If the parole board, after review of such findings, determines that the parolee no longer has a terminal, debilitating, incapacitating, or incurable medical condition or syndrome, the medical parole shall be revoked and the parolee shall be returned to the custody of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding RSA 504-A:5, a medical parolee who is arrested under the authority of RSA 504-A:4 or RSA 651-A:25 shall be detained at the medical unit or infirmary of the appropriate state correctional facility closest to the location where he or she was arrested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. An inmate who has been sentenced to life in prison without parole or sentenced to death shall not be eligible for medical parole under this section.  Nothing in this provision or law shall be construed to create a right to medical parole for any inmate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding RSA 167:18-a, the state shall be responsible for all medicaid costs incurred, net of federal reimbursement, for any inmate granted medical parole under this section, until the earliest date on which parole could have been granted had the inmate not been granted medical parole.
