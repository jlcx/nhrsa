&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651-A:1 Purpose of Parole. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the intent of the legislature that the state parole system provide a means of supervising and rehabilitating offenders without continued incarceration and a means by which prisoners can be aided in the transition from prison to society.  It is also the intent of the legislature that the policies, procedures and actions of the adult parole board and the department of corrections relative to the administration of this system emphasize the need to protect the public from criminal acts by parolees.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651-A:25 Execution of Compact Authorized. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governor of this state is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the state of New Hampshire with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A Compact entered into by and among the contracting states, signatories hereto, with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled "An Act Granting the Consent of Congress to any two or more States to enter into Agreements or Compacts for Cooperative Effort and Mutual Assistance in the Prevention of Crime and for other purposes.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The contracting states solemnly agree:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact, herein called "sending state,'' to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact, herein called "receiving state,'' while on probation or parole, if (a) Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;  (b) Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.  Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.  A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than 6 continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole.  For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken.  All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons.  The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state;  provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharge from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any hearings, including final revocation hearings, to which a probationer or parolee is entitled prior to incarceration or reincarceration for a violation of probation or parole may, at the discretion of the court or parole board involved, be held before the appropriate court or parole board of the receiving state.  In such event, the appropriate court or parole board of the sending state shall transfer jurisdiction of the case to the appropriate court of the receiving state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. That the governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing.  When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it.  The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state.  Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending 6 months' notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. It is hereby declared that the word "state'' as used in this subdivision means any one of the several states and Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia.  It is hereby recognized and further declared that pursuant to the consent and authorization contained in Section 112(b) of title 4 of the United States Code as added by Public Law 970-84th Congress, Chapter 941-2d Session, this state shall be a party to said Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers with any additional jurisdiction legally joining therein when such jurisdiction shall have enacted said compact, in accordance with the terms thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. An individual who is on parole or probation in another state, who is present in this state without the permission of the officer of this state designated under paragraph V of this section, and who does not leave this state within 7 days after being notified in writing by a law enforcement officer that the individual may not remain in this state without the permission of the designated officer, is guilty of a class B felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Within 24 hours after a law enforcement officer has notified an individual that he or she may not remain within the state without the permission of the designated officer, the law enforcement officer shall report the notification to the designated officer.  An individual who is on parole or probation in another state may not remain in this state without the permission of the officer of this state designated under paragraph V of this section.  In a prosecution for an offense under this section, an individual's good faith belief that he or she had received permission to be present in this state is an affirmative defense if the individual acted in reasonable reliance upon the written statements of an authorized officer of this state or the state in which the individual is on parole or probation.  This defense is not available to a person who remains present in this state after being notified in writing by the designated officer of this state that the individual does not have permission to be present.

The interstate commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote reflected in the vote of each member on the question.  All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.
