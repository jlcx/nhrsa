&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the expiration of the term of his maximum sentence, a paroled prisoner shall be entitled to receive a final discharge, provided that at the time of such expiration no proceedings are pending for his recommitment.  Such proceedings shall be deemed to be pending when a warrant has been issued or an arrest has been made under RSA 651-A:15-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For each parolee affected by this section, the board shall determine the amount of time the parolee was at liberty while in noncompliance with the terms and conditions of parole, as specified in RSA 651-A:19.  The board may recommit the parolee to the state prison for a period not to exceed the amount of time so determined.
