The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each compacting state and shall adopt rules binding upon all compacting states which govern said assessment.

IV. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.
