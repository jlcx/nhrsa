&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 632-A:10-a Penalties. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding RSA 651:2, and except where an extended term is sought as provided in RSA 651:6:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person convicted of aggravated felonious sexual assault under:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) RSA 632-A:2, I(l) shall be sentenced in accordance with subparagraph (b) and paragraphs II-V and may be sentenced to lifetime supervision under paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any provision of RSA 632-A:2 shall be sentenced to a maximum sentence which is not to exceed 20 years and a minimum which is not to exceed  1/2 of the maximum.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a court finds that a defendant has been previously convicted under RSA 632-A:2 or any other statute prohibiting the same conduct in another state, territory or possession of the United States, the defendant shall be sentenced to a maximum sentence which is not to exceed 40 years and a minimum which is not to exceed  1/2 of the maximum.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the court finds that a defendant has been previously convicted of 2 or more offenses under RSA 632-A:2 or any other statute prohibiting the same conduct in another state, territory or possession of the United States, the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment and shall not be eligible for parole at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In this section, the phrase "previously convicted'' shall mean any conviction obtained by trial on the merits, or negotiated plea with the assistance of counsel and evidencing a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of the defendant's rights, provided, however, that previous imprisonment is not required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) When a defendant pleads or is found guilty of aggravated felonious sexual assault under RSA 632-A:2, I(l), the judge may include in sentencing, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, a special sentence of lifetime supervision by the department of corrections.  The defendant shall comply with the conditions of lifetime supervision which are imposed by the court or the department of corrections.  Violation of any terms of lifetime supervisions shall be deemed contempt of court.  The special sentence of lifetime supervision shall begin upon the release of the offender from incarceration, parole or probation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person sentenced to lifetime supervision under subparagraph (a) may petition the court for release from lifetime supervision.  The court shall grant a petition for release from a special sentence of lifetime supervision if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The person has not committed a crime for 15 years after his last conviction or release from incarceration, whichever occurs later;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The person is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others if released from supervision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Prior to granting any petition pursuant to subparagraph V(b), the court shall provide notice to the county attorney who prosecuted the case, the victim advocate, and the victim or victim's family and permit those parties to be heard on the petition.  If the court denies the offender's petition, the offender may not file another application pursuant to this paragraph for 5 years from the date of the denial and shall include a risk assessment prepared at the offender's expense.
