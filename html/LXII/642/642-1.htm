<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person is guilty of a misdemeanor if that person uses intimidation, actual or threatened force or violence, simulated legal process, or engages in any other unlawful conduct with a purpose to hinder or interfere with a public servant, as defined in RSA 640:2, II, performing or purporting to perform an official function or to retaliate for the performance or purported performance of such a function.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Flight by a person charged with an offense, refusal by anyone to submit to arrest, or any such interference in connection with a labor dispute with the government shall be prosecuted under the statutes governing such matters and not under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III.  In this section, "simulated legal process'' means a document or order which purports to have been issued by a court or filed or recorded for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction or representing a claim against a person or property, or for the purpose of directing a person to appear before a court or tribunal, or to perform or refrain from performing a specified act, but which the actor knows was not lawfully issued or rendered in accordance with the applicable statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances of the federal, state, or local government, or a political subdivision thereof.  "Simulated legal process'' includes any document that purports to be a summons, lien, indictment, complaint, warrant, injunction, writ, notice, pleading, subpoena, or order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For any offense committed under paragraph I that involved the use of simulated legal process, the court may impose the following remedies, in addition to any criminal penalties authorized under RSA 651:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such appropriate injunctive relief as the court may deem necessary to prevent continued violations of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Restitution to the public official for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the simulated legal process, including legal fees.
