&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 626:5 Entrapment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is an affirmative defense that the actor committed the offense because he was induced or encouraged to do so by a law enforcement official or by a person acting in cooperation with a law enforcement official, for the purpose of obtaining evidence against him and when the methods used to obtain such evidence were such as to create a substantial risk that the offense would be committed by a person not otherwise disposed to commit it.  However, conduct merely affording a person an opportunity to commit an offense does not constitute entrapment.
