&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 626:2 General Requirements of Culpability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person is guilty of murder, a felony, or a misdemeanor only if he acts purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense.  He may be guilty of a violation without regard to such culpability.  When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for its commission, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such culpability shall apply to all the material elements, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The following are culpable mental states:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Purposely.''  A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an offense when his conscious object is to cause the result or engage in the conduct that comprises the element.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Knowingly.''  A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance that is a material element of an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstances exist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Recklessly.''  A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.  The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the circumstances known to him, its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the situation.  A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of having voluntarily engaged in intoxication or hypnosis also acts recklessly with respect thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Negligently.''  A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he fails to become aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.  The risk must be of such a nature and degree that his failure to become aware of it constitutes a gross deviation from the conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element is also established if the person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly.  When recklessness suffices, the element is also established if the person acts purposely or knowingly.  When acting knowingly suffices, the element is also established if a person acts purposely.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A requirement that an offense be committed wilfully is satisfied if the person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements appears.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Neither knowledge nor recklessness nor negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense or as to the existence or meaning of the law defining the offense is an element of such offense, unless the law so provides.
