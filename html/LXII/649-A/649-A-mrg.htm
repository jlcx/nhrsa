&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 649-A:1 Declaration of Findings and Purposes. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislature finds that there has been a proliferation of exploitation of children through their use as subjects in sexual performances.  The care of children is a sacred trust and should not be abused by those who seek to profit through a commercial network based upon the exploitation of children.  The public policy of the state demands the protection of children from exploitation through sexual performances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is the purpose of this chapter to facilitate the prosecution of those who exploit children in the manner specified in paragraph I.  In accordance with the United States Supreme Court's decision in New York v. Ferber, this chapter makes the dissemination of visual representations of children under the age of 16 engaged in sexual activity illegal irrespective of whether the visual representations are legally obscene;  and the legislature urges law enforcement officers to aggressively seek out and prosecute those who violate the provisions of this chapter.

Sexual intercourse is simulated when it depicts explicit sexual intercourse that gives the appearance of the consummation of sexual intercourse, normal or perverted.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Previous conviction'' or "previously convicted'' means having been convicted by a jury or a judge, or having plead guilty prior to the commission of the current offense.  For purposes of this paragraph, a previous conviction need not have been affirmed on appeal.
