<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A teacher or person otherwise entrusted with the care or supervision of a minor for special purposes is justified on the premises in using necessary force against any such minor, when the minor creates a disturbance, or refuses to leave the premises or when it is necessary for the maintenance of discipline.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In a child care program licensed or exempt from licensure under RSA 170-E, necessary force shall be limited to the minimum physical contact necessary to protect the child, other children present, the staff, or the general public from harm.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person responsible for the general care and supervision of an incompetent person is justified in using force for the purpose of safeguarding his welfare, or, when such incompetent person is in an institution for his care and custody, for the maintenance of reasonable discipline in such institution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The justification extended in paragraphs I, II, and III does not apply to the malicious or reckless use of force that creates a risk of death, serious bodily injury, or substantial pain.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A person authorized by law to maintain decorum or safety in a vessel, aircraft, vehicle, train or other carrier, in a hospital or other health care facility, or in a place where others are assembled may use non-deadly force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes it necessary for such purposes, but the person may use deadly force only when he or she reasonably believes it necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.
<br>

VII. A licensed physician, or a person acting under his or her direction, or an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) working for the department of corrections may use force for the purpose of administering a recognized form of treatment which he or she reasonably believes will tend to promote the physical or mental health of the patient, provided such treatment is administered:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) With consent of the patient or, if the patient is a minor or incompetent person, with the consent of the person entrusted with his care and supervision;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In an emergency when the physician or the advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) reasonably believes that no one competent to consent can be consulted and that a reasonable person concerned for the welfare of the patient would consent.
