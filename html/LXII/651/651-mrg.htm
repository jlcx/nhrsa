<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) A person may be placed on probation if the court finds that such person is in need of the supervision and guidance that the probation service can provide under such conditions as the court may impose.  The period of probation shall be for a period to be fixed by the court not to exceed 5 years for a felony and 2 years for a class A misdemeanor.  Upon petition of the probation officer or the probationer, the period may be terminated sooner by the court if the conduct of the probationer warrants it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In cases of persons convicted of felonies or class A misdemeanors, or in cases of persons found to be habitual offenders within the meaning of RSA 259:39 and convicted of an offense under RSA 262:23, the sentence may include, as a condition of probation, confinement to a person's place of residence for not more than one year in case of a class A misdemeanor or more than 5 years in case of a felony.  Such home confinement may be monitored by a probation officer and may be supplemented, as determined by the department of corrections or by the county department of corrections, by electronic monitoring to verify compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon recommendation by the department of corrections or by the county department of corrections, the court may, as a condition of probation, order an incarceration-bound offender placed in an intensive supervision program as an alternative to incarceration, under requirements and restrictions established by the department of corrections or by the county department of corrections.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The court may include, as a condition of probation, restitution to the victim as provided in RSA 651:62-67 or performance of uncompensated public service as provided in RSA 651:68-70.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The court may include, as a condition of probation, a jail sentence of up to 30 days that a probation/parole officer may impose in segments of one to 7 days over the course of the probation period, in response to any violation of a condition of probation, in lieu of a violation of probation hearing.  Such jail sanction shall be served at the county jail facility closest to or in reasonable proximity to where the probationer is under supervision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) A person may be sentenced to a period of conditional discharge if such person is not imprisoned and the court is of the opinion that probationary supervision is unnecessary, but that the defendant's conduct should be according to conditions determined by the court.  Such conditions may include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Restrictions on the defendant's travel, association, place of abode, such as will protect the victim of the crime or insure the public peace;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An order requiring the defendant to attend counselling or any other mode of treatment the court deems appropriate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Restitution to the victim;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Performance of uncompensated public service as provided in RSA 651:68-70.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The period of a conditional discharge shall be 3 years for a felony and one year for a misdemeanor or violation.  However, if the court has required as a condition that the defendant make restitution or reparation to the victim of the defendant's offense or that the defendant perform uncompensated public service and that condition has not been satisfied, the court may, at any time prior to the termination of the above periods, extend the period for a felony by no more than 2 years and for a misdemeanor or violation by no more than one year in order to allow the defendant to satisfy the condition.  During any period of conditional discharge the court may, upon its own motion or on petition of the defendant, discharge the defendant unconditionally if the conduct of the defendant warrants it.  The court is not required to revoke a conditional discharge if the defendant commits an additional offense or violates a condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-a. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-b. A person sentenced to conditional discharge under paragraph VI may apply for annulment of the criminal record under RSA 651:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. When a probation or a conditional discharge is revoked, the defendant may be fined, as authorized by paragraph IV, if a fine was not imposed in addition to the probation or conditional discharge.  Otherwise the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment as authorized by paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A person may be granted an unconditional discharge if the court is of the opinion that no proper purpose would be served by imposing any condition or supervision upon the defendant's release.  A sentence of unconditional discharge is for all purposes a final judgment of conviction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651:3 Calculation of Periods. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A sentence of imprisonment commences when it is imposed if the defendant is in custody or surrenders into custody at that time.  Otherwise, it commences when he becomes actually in custody.  All the time actually spent in custody prior to the time he is sentenced shall be credited in the manner set forth in RSA 651-A:23 against the maximum term of imprisonment that is imposed and against any minimum term authorized by RSA 651:2 or 6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a court determines that the defendant violated the conditions of his probation or conditional discharge but reinstates the probation or discharge, the period between the date of the violation and the date of restoration is not computed as part of the period of probation or discharge.

The court may, in its discretion, order a presentence investigation for a defendant convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor;  provided that, upon the recommendation of the prosecution, the court shall order a presentence investigation report where the felony or misdemeanor was violent and the court has reason to believe that the defendant committed a similar act within the past year.  The report shall include a recommendation as to disposition, together with reference to such material disclosed by the investigation as supports such recommendation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before imposing sentence, the court shall take such steps as may be necessary so that the defendant is advised, by counsel or otherwise, as the situation warrants, of the factual contents of any presentence investigation, and afforded a fair opportunity to contest them.  The sources of confidential information need not, however, be disclosed.

(b) The physical act or acts constituting the crime of which the person was found not guilty by reason of insanity caused death or serious bodily injury as defined in RSA 625:11, VI, to him or another, or created a grave risk of death or serious bodily injury to him or another;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person suffers from the mental disorder or a substantially similar mental condition as existed at the time he committed the act or acts which constituted the crime of which he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Without otherwise limiting the discretion of the court, a court may find that it would be dangerous for a person to go at large if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) He has been found not guilty by reason of insanity of a crime;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The physical act or acts constituting the crime of which the person was found not guilty by reason of insanity resulted in damage to the property of another, or created a grave risk of damage to the property of another, or caused harm or a risk of harm to himself or another;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person suffers from the mental disorder or a substantially similar mental condition as existed at the time he committed the act or acts which constituted the crime of which he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The following provisions shall apply after the court renews the order of committal pursuant to paragraph I of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the court renews the order of committal but finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person's release under certain conditions, including, but not limited to, a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, would no longer create a substantial risk of bodily injury to himself or another person or serious damage to property of another, the court may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Order that he be conditionally discharged under conditions the court finds appropriate, including any prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment that has been prepared for him, which has been certified to the court as appropriate by the commissioner of the department of corrections or his designee or by the director of another facility not within the department of corrections in which he is committed, and which has been found by the court to be appropriate;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Order, as an explicit condition of release, that he comply with the conditions imposed by the court, including any prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The court at any time may, after a hearing employing the same criteria as a hearing pursuant to subparagraph (a), modify or eliminate the conditions imposed, including any prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner of the department of corrections or the director of another program or facility not within the department of corrections responsible for administering a condition or regimen imposed on a person conditionally discharged under subparagraph (a) shall notify the attorney general and the court having jurisdiction over the person of any failure of the person to comply with the condition or regimen, or of any other circumstances which create a reasonable likelihood that it is dangerous for the person to remain conditionally discharged.  Upon such notice, or upon other probable cause to believe that the person has failed to comply with the condition or prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment, or that other circumstances exist which create a reasonable likelihood that it is dangerous for the person to remain conditionally discharged, the person may be arrested, and, upon arrest, shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the court having jurisdiction over him.  The court shall, after a hearing, determine whether the person should be remanded to the secure psychiatric unit or to another suitable facility on the basis that in light of his failure to comply with the conditions imposed by the court, including any prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, or because of other circumstances, his continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to himself or another person or serious damage to property of another.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A sentencing court may recommend at the time of sentencing, or the superintendent of the county correctional facility may, at any time during the sentence, allow any person who has been committed to a correctional institution other than state prison under a criminal sentence to be released therefrom for the purpose of obtaining and working at gainful employment, for the performance of uncompensated public service as provided in RSA 651:68-70, under the terms of a day reporting program, provided the correctional facility has a day reporting program, or to serve the sentence under home confinement, provided the correctional facility has a home confinement program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the sentencing court recommends a person for release and the superintendent determines the person is inappropriate for such release, the court shall be notified and, at the request of the defendant, a hearing may be scheduled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the sentencing court does not include a recommendation for release pursuant to paragraph I in its order, but at any time during the sentence the superintendent deems such a release to be conducive to the person's rehabilitation, the court and the prosecutor shall be notified and, at the request of the prosecutor, a hearing may be scheduled.  The decision of the superintendent for release under this paragraph shall stand unless, following the hearing, the court orders otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In any case, the defendant shall first serve 14 consecutive days prior to eligibility for home confinement, or for such other purpose as the court or the superintendent may deem conducive to his or her rehabilitation, for such times or intervals of time and under such terms and conditions as the rules and regulations of the correctional facility may allow or as the court may order.  Any part of a day spent in the free community, or in home confinement, under such a release order shall be counted as a full day toward the serving of the sentence unless otherwise provided by the court.  If a person violates the terms and conditions laid down for his or her conduct, custody, and employment, he or she shall be returned to the correctional facility.  The superintendent may then require that the balance of the person's sentence be spent in actual confinement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651:20 Incarceration Under Suspended Sentence. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as provided in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c), the sentence to imprisonment of any person may be suspended by the sentencing court at the time of imposition of the sentence or at any time thereafter in response to a petition to suspend sentence which is timely brought in accordance with the limitations set forth below in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any person sentenced to state prison for a minimum term of 6 years or more shall not bring a petition to suspend sentence until such person has served at least 4 years or  2/3 of his minimum sentence, whichever is greater, and not more frequently than every 3 years thereafter.  Any person sentenced to state prison for a minimum term of less than 6 years shall not bring a petition to suspend sentence until such person has served at least  2/3 of the minimum sentence, or the petition has been authorized by the sentencing court.  For the purposes of this subparagraph:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) For concurrent terms of imprisonment, the minimum term shall be satisfied by serving the longest minimum term imposed, and the maximum term shall be satisfied by serving the longest maximum term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For consecutive terms of imprisonment, the minimum terms of each sentence shall be added to arrive at an aggregate minimum term, and the maximum terms of each sentence shall be added to arrive at an aggregate maximum term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A petition to suspend the sentence of any state prisoner may be brought at any time if, prior to the petition being filed, the commissioner of the department of corrections has found that the prisoner is a suitable candidate for suspension of sentence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A petition to suspend the sentence of any state prisoner may be brought at any time by the attorney general in recognition of substantial assistance by the inmate in the investigation or prosecution of a serious felony offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Petitions filed which do not meet the criteria in (a), (b), or (c) above shall be dismissed without a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A person whose sentence has been suspended may be required to report to the institution to which he has been sentenced to be incarcerated during weekends or at such times or intervals of time as the court may direct, except that weekend sentence provisions do not apply to the New Hampshire state prison.  Time so spent in said institution shall be deducted from the maximum term, and where there are both a minimum and maximum term, from both.  Any part of a day spent in the institution shall count as a full day toward the sentence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As a condition of any suspension of sentence, the court may include restitution to the victim, as provided in RSA 651:62-67, performance of uncompensated public service as provided in RSA 651:68-70, and such other conditions as the court may determine.

The court may direct that, after deducting therefrom the cost of his maintenance while not confined, the balance be applied as needed for restitution payments made to authorized claimants pursuant to RSA 651:62 through 66 and for the support and maintenance of his dependents.  Any balance after such applications shall be deposited in a savings account to be released to him or applied as needed for restitution payments or the support of his dependents as the court may order, or applied to the designated cost of room and board at the institution for the period of time during which the inmate is working before the expiration of his sentence.  Upon expiration of his sentence the balance remaining shall be paid to him or his order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651:25 Release From State Prison. &#150;</b>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner of corrections may release any person who has been committed to the state prison at any time during the term of sentence for the purpose of obtaining and working at gainful employment, for the performance of uncompensated public service as provided in RSA 651:68-70, or for such other purpose as may be deemed conducive to his rehabilitation, for such times or intervals of time and under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A, provided, however, that a prisoner who has not served sufficient time to be eligible for parole may be released under this section only if the sentencing court and the prosecutor of the underlying offense have been notified of the proposed release, and there has been no objection within 10 days of the notice by either the sentencing court or the prosecutor of the underlying offense.  If the prosecutor of the underlying offense objects to the proposed release, the prosecutor shall submit in writing to the sentencing court the reasons for objecting.  The sentencing court shall, within 10 days of receipt of the prosecutor's objection, schedule a hearing on the proposed release.  The sentencing court shall then approve or deny the proposed release.  The commissioner of corrections may permit inmates of the state prison, who volunteer to do so, to be gainfully employed outside the institution when such employment is considered in their best interest and the best interest of the state.  Inmates may be so employed by the state or by public or private employers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The rates of pay and other conditions of employment of a person released for work shall be the same as those paid or required in the locality in which the work is performed.  An inmate so employed shall surrender to the commissioner of corrections his total earnings less payroll deductions authorized by law, including income taxes.  After deducting from the earnings of each person an amount determined to be the cost of the person's keep, the commissioner shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Allow the person to draw from the balance a sufficient sum to cover his incidental expenses;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Credit to his account such amount as seems necessary to accumulate a reasonable sum to be paid to him on his release;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Cause to be paid such part of any additional balance as is needed for restitution payments to authorized claimants pursuant to RSA 651:62 through 66;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Cause to be paid such part of any additional balance as is needed for the support of the person's dependents and notify the overseer of public welfare of the town, in which the person's dependents reside, of such support payments;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Pay the balance to the person when he is released.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any part of a day a prisoner is employed outside the walls of the institution shall count as a full day toward the serving of his sentence as though served inside the walls.  An inmate so employed outside shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the institution and be under the direction and control of the officers thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If an inmate released for work escapes or fails to return inside the walls of the institution as required by the rules or the orders of the officers thereof or if on administrative home confinement, knowingly leaves a place without authority to do so, such inmate shall be punished as provided by RSA 642:6.  The commissioner of corrections may at any time recall a prisoner from such release status if the commissioner believes or has reason to believe the peace, safety, welfare, or security of the community may be endangered by the prisoner being under such release status.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A prisoner authorized to work at paid employment in the community under this section may be required to pay, and the commissioner of corrections is authorized to collect, such cost incident to the prisoner's confinement as the commissioner deems appropriate and reasonable.  The first $325,000 of such collections shall be deposited in each fiscal year with the state treasurer as a part of the general revenue of the state.  The commissioner shall deposit any amount in excess of $325,000 into the transitional housing unit maintenance fund established in RSA 21-H:14-d.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A low-risk, nonviolent prisoner who has not served sufficient time to be eligible for parole as provided in RSA 651-A:6, I, may be released on parole notwithstanding such provision, subject to the other provisions of RSA 651-A, provided that the following requirements are met before the parole board schedules a hearing on the proposed parole:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The prisoner has been sentenced to the state prison for an offense other than capital, first degree or second degree murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated felonious sexual assault, felonious sexual assault or first degree assault;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prisoner has been assigned a course of programs or treatment, has successfully completed such course, and has been found by the commissioner of corrections to be a suitable candidate for early parole;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner of corrections has submitted findings and a recommendation for early parole to the parole board;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commissioner of corrections has notified the sentencing court and the prosecutor of the underlying offense of the proposed parole, and the court has not objected in writing within 20 days of such notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) The commissioner of corrections may release a prisoner who is serving a New Hampshire state sentence to the custody and control of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement if all of the following requirements are satisfied:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The department of corrections receives an order of deportation for the prisoner from the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The prisoner has served at least  1/3 of the minimum sentences imposed by the court;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The prisoner was not convicted of a violent crime, or any crime of obstruction of justice, or sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment under RSA 651:6;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The prisoner was not convicted of a sexual offense as defined in RSA 651-B:1, V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a prisoner who is released from his or her state sentence pursuant to this section returns illegally to the United States, on notification from any federal or state law enforcement agency that the prisoner is in custody, the commissioner of corrections shall revoke the prisoner's release and immediately file a detainer seeking the prisoner's return to the custody of the department of corrections to serve the remainder of his or her sentence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651:61-a Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislature finds and declares that the victims of crimes often suffer losses through no fault of their own and for which there is no compensation.  It also finds that repayment, in whole or in part, by the offender to the victim can operate to rehabilitate the offender.  It is the purpose of this act to establish a presumption that the victim will be compensated by the offender who is responsible for the loss.  Restitution by the offender can serve to reinforce the offender's sense of responsibility for the offense, to provide the offender the opportunity to pay the offender's debt to society and to the victim in a constructive manner, and to ease the burden of the victim as a result of the criminal act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislature does not intend that restitution be contingent upon an offender's current ability to pay or upon the availability of other compensation.  The legislature intends that the court increase, to the maximum extent feasible, the number of instances in which victims receive restitution.  The legislature does not intend the use of restitution to result in preferential treatment for offenders with substantial financial resources.

<center><h3>Section 651:63</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 651:63 Restitution Authorized. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any offender may be sentenced to make restitution in an amount determined by the court.  In any case in which restitution is not ordered, the court shall state its reasons therefor on the record or in its sentencing order.  Restitution may be ordered regardless of the offender's ability to pay and regardless of the availability of other compensation;  however, restitution is not intended to compensate the victim more than once for the same injury.  A restitution order is not a civil judgment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Restitution ordered shall be in addition to any other penalty or fine and may be a condition of probation or parole.  Restitution, if ordered, may also be a condition of any work release program administered under RSA 651:19 or RSA 651:25.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The making of a restitution order shall not affect the right of a victim to compensation under RSA 21-M:8-h, except to the extent that restitution is actually collected pursuant to the order.  The offender shall reimburse the victims' assistance fund for any payments made by the fund to the victim pursuant to RSA 21-M:8-h after the restitution order is satisfied.  Refused or unclaimed restitution payments shall be made to the victims' assistance fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court's determination of the amount of restitution shall not be admissible as evidence in a civil action.  The court shall reduce any civil damage awards by restitution ordered and paid to the victim.  Restitution orders shall survive bankruptcy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court shall add 17 percent to the total restitution payment as an administrative fee to be paid by the offender.  Such administrative fee shall be divided into the following components, to be designated as follows:  15 percent shall be continually appropriated to a special fund for the division of field services, department of corrections, $22,500 of which shall lapse to the general fund at the end of each quarter should that amount be received, to maximize restitution collections, directly or through agents of contractors selected by the department;  and 2 percent for the victims' assistance fund.  Unexpended account balances in the special fund for the division of field services in excess of $50,000 at the end of the fiscal year shall lapse to the general fund.  Administrative fees shall be paid by the offender in addition to and when each restitution payment is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Restitution, administrative fines and fees, and other fees collected, except for supervision fees pursuant to RSA 504-A:13, shall be allocated on a pro-rata basis by the commissioner of corrections or his or her designee when payments are insufficient to cover the full amount due for each of these balances, except that restitution to victims shall have priority over all other allocations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. On or before July 1, 1997, and each year thereafter until July 1, 2000, the division of field services, department of corrections, shall submit an annual budget plan to the joint legislative fiscal committee.  The division of field services, department of corrections, shall have the authority to hire temporary personnel and to procure equipment and expend relevant operating expenses as may be necessary to implement this chapter.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The time and method of restitution payments or performance of restitution services shall be specified by the department of corrections.  Monetary restitution may be by lump sum, or by periodic installments in any amounts.  The court shall not be required to reduce the total obligation as a result of the offender's inability to pay.  The offender shall bear the burden of demonstrating lack of ability to pay.  Restitution shall be paid by the offender to the department of corrections unless otherwise ordered by the court.  Monetary restitution shall not bear interest.  Restitution shall be made to any collateral source or subrogee, if authorized by that source and after restitution to the victim, and to the victims' assistance fund, if applicable, has been satisfied.  Restitution shall be a continuing obligation of the offender's estate and shall inure to the benefit of the victim's estate, provided that no indebtedness shall pass to any heir of the offender's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of corrections shall have continuing authority over the offender for purposes of enforcing restitution until the restitution order is satisfied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department may garnish the offender's wages for the purpose of ensuring payment of victim restitution.
