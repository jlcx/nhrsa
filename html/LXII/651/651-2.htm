<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) A person may be placed on probation if the court finds that such person is in need of the supervision and guidance that the probation service can provide under such conditions as the court may impose.  The period of probation shall be for a period to be fixed by the court not to exceed 5 years for a felony and 2 years for a class A misdemeanor.  Upon petition of the probation officer or the probationer, the period may be terminated sooner by the court if the conduct of the probationer warrants it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In cases of persons convicted of felonies or class A misdemeanors, or in cases of persons found to be habitual offenders within the meaning of RSA 259:39 and convicted of an offense under RSA 262:23, the sentence may include, as a condition of probation, confinement to a person's place of residence for not more than one year in case of a class A misdemeanor or more than 5 years in case of a felony.  Such home confinement may be monitored by a probation officer and may be supplemented, as determined by the department of corrections or by the county department of corrections, by electronic monitoring to verify compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon recommendation by the department of corrections or by the county department of corrections, the court may, as a condition of probation, order an incarceration-bound offender placed in an intensive supervision program as an alternative to incarceration, under requirements and restrictions established by the department of corrections or by the county department of corrections.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon recommendation by the department of corrections or by the county department of corrections, the court may sentence an incarceration-bound offender to a special alternative incarceration program involving short term confinement followed by intensive community supervision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The court may include, as a condition of probation, restitution to the victim as provided in RSA 651:62-67 or performance of uncompensated public service as provided in RSA 651:68-70.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) In cases of a person convicted of a felony or class A misdemeanor, a court may require such person to be screened and/or evaluated for risk of substance use disorders at an impaired driver care management program (IDCMP) approved by the department of health and human services, and to comply with the treatment plan developed by the IDCMP as established under RSA 265-A:40, if the evidence demonstrates that substances were a contributing factor in the commission of the offense and if such person has the ability to pay the fees for the program in full.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The court may include, as a condition of probation, a jail sentence of up to 30 days that a probation/parole officer may impose in segments of one to 7 days over the course of the probation period, in response to any violation of a condition of probation, in lieu of a violation of probation hearing.  Such jail sanction shall be served at the county jail facility closest to or in reasonable proximity to where the probationer is under supervision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) A person may be sentenced to a period of conditional discharge if such person is not imprisoned and the court is of the opinion that probationary supervision is unnecessary, but that the defendant's conduct should be according to conditions determined by the court.  Such conditions may include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Restrictions on the defendant's travel, association, place of abode, such as will protect the victim of the crime or insure the public peace;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An order requiring the defendant to attend counselling or any other mode of treatment the court deems appropriate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Restitution to the victim;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Performance of uncompensated public service as provided in RSA 651:68-70.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The period of a conditional discharge shall be 3 years for a felony and one year for a misdemeanor or violation.  However, if the court has required as a condition that the defendant make restitution or reparation to the victim of the defendant's offense or that the defendant perform uncompensated public service and that condition has not been satisfied, the court may, at any time prior to the termination of the above periods, extend the period for a felony by no more than 2 years and for a misdemeanor or violation by no more than one year in order to allow the defendant to satisfy the condition.  During any period of conditional discharge the court may, upon its own motion or on petition of the defendant, discharge the defendant unconditionally if the conduct of the defendant warrants it.  The court is not required to revoke a conditional discharge if the defendant commits an additional offense or violates a condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-a. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-b. A person sentenced to conditional discharge under paragraph VI may apply for annulment of the criminal record under RSA 651:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. When a probation or a conditional discharge is revoked, the defendant may be fined, as authorized by paragraph IV, if a fine was not imposed in addition to the probation or conditional discharge.  Otherwise the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment as authorized by paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A person may be granted an unconditional discharge if the court is of the opinion that no proper purpose would be served by imposing any condition or supervision upon the defendant's release.  A sentence of unconditional discharge is for all purposes a final judgment of conviction.
