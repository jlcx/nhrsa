<codesect>
This subdivision does not bar, suspend, or otherwise affect any right or liability for damages, penalty, forfeiture or other remedy authorized by law to be recovered or enforced in a civil action, regardless of whether the conduct involved in such civil action constitutes an economic loss.  Any restitution ordered and paid shall be deducted from the amount of any judgment awarded in a civil action brought by the victim or other authorized claimant against the offender based on the same facts.  If the restitution ordered and made was work restitution, the reasonable value of the services may be deducted from any such judgment.
