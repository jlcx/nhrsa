&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 369-B:3 Authority to Issue Finance Orders to Finance RRB Costs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission is authorized, upon the petition of an electric utility and after a hearing, to issue one or more finance orders pursuant to which rate reduction bonds shall be issued, if the commission finds that the issuance of such finance order or finance orders is in the public interest as set forth in RSA 369-B:1, IX or RSA 369-B:1, XVI, as applicable.  Any finance order adopted pursuant to 1999, 289:3, I and II prior to the effective date of this chapter shall, following the effective date of this chapter, be deemed to be authorized by this chapter, provided the commission has made the required finding pursuant to RSA 369-B:3, IV(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, except as otherwise provided in RSA 369-B:4, III with respect to RRB property, the finance orders and the RRB charge authorized to be imposed and collected pursuant to such finance orders shall be irrevocable, and the commission shall not have authority either by rescinding, altering, or amending the finance order or otherwise, to directly or indirectly, revalue or revise for ratemaking purposes the RRB costs, or the costs of providing, recovering, financing, or refinancing the RRB costs, determine that such RRB charge is unjust or unreasonable, or in any way reduce or impair the value of RRB property either directly or indirectly by taking such RRB charge (other than any portion of such RRB charge constituting a servicing fee payable to the electric utility) into account when setting other rates for the electric utility;  nor shall the amount of revenues arising with respect thereto be subject to reduction, impairment, postponement, or termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, any requirement under this chapter, under 1999, 289:3, I and II, under RSA 369-A, or under a finance order that the commission take action with respect to the subject matter of a finance order shall be binding upon the commission, and the commission shall have no authority to rescind, alter, or amend that requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission shall only issue finance orders that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Authorize the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of not more than $130,000,000 in rate reduction bonds to finance renegotiated agreements of the existing power purchase obligations requiring PSNH to purchase power from the 6 wood-to-energy facilities and the one trash-to-energy facility;  and/or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Authorize the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of not more than $670,000,000, minus $6,000,000 for each month from October 1, 2000 to competition day, in rate reduction bonds.  This authorization is in addition to any amount authorized in subparagraph (a).  This issuance must be part of a settlement approved by the commission under RSA 374-F to implement electric utility restructuring within the service territory of PSNH. As part of any finance order under this subparagraph (b), the commission must find that the rate reduction bonds authorized by the finance order are consistent with the April 19 order, with any subsequent modifications.  Any finance order that is issued under this subparagraph (b) shall also contain a statement of the following conditions, and a finding of the commission that the finance order is consistent with the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) (A) From competition day until the completion of the sale of PSNH's ownership interests in fossil and hydro generation assets located in New Hampshire, PSNH shall supply all, except as modified pursuant to RSA 374-F:3, V(f), transition service and default service offered in its retail electric service territory from its generation assets and, if necessary, through supplemental power purchases in a manner approved by the commission.  The price of such default service shall be PSNH's actual, prudent, and reasonable costs of providing such power, as approved by the commission;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) (i) Transition service for residential customers, street lighting customers, and general delivery service rate G customers shall be available until at least 24 months after initial transition service end day or as extended by the commission under RSA 374-F:3, V.  From competition day until 21 months after competition day, the price of transition service for these customers shall be $0.044 per kilowatt-hour together with, for those customers choosing a renewable energy transition service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), the price of the renewable energy component.  From 21 months after competition day until initial transition service end day, the price of transition service for these customers shall be $0.046 per kilowatt-hour together with, for those customers choosing a renewable energy transition service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), the price of the renewable energy component;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) From initial transition service end day to the day that PSNH ceases to provide transition service, the price of transition service shall be PSNH's actual, prudent, and reasonable costs of providing such power, as approved by the commission, together with, for those customers choosing a renewable energy transition service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), the price of the renewable energy component.  Thereafter, the price of transition service, if offered, shall be the competitively bid price for transition service, or as determined under RSA 374-F:3, V(e), together with, for those customers choosing a renewable energy transition service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), the price of the renewable energy component;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) At the end of the transition service period, up to 25 percent of the residential customers, street lighting customers, and general delivery service rate G customers who have not chosen a competitive supplier may be assigned randomly to registered competitive suppliers other than the transition service supplier or suppliers, if the commission finds such random assignment to be in the public interest.  The commission shall develop procedures and regulations for this assignment process.  Any random assignment must be affirmatively approved by an individual customer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Transition service for all other customers shall be available until at least 12 months after initial transition service end day or as extended by the commission under RSA 374-F:3, V.  From competition day to 21 months after competition day, the price of transition service for these customers shall be $0.044 per kilowatt-hour together with, for those customers choosing a renewable energy transition service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), the price of the renewable energy component.  From 21 months after competition day to the day that PSNH ceases to provide transition service, the price of transition service shall be PSNH's actual, prudent, and reasonable costs of providing such power as approved by the commission, together with, for those customers choosing a renewable energy transition service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), the price of the renewable energy component.  Thereafter, the price of transition service, if offered, shall be the competitively bid price for transition service, or as determined under RSA 374-F:3, V(e), together with, for those customers choosing a renewable energy transition service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), the price of the renewable energy component;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Any difference between the price of transition service, exclusive of the portion attributable to the renewable energy component under RSA 374-F:3, V(f), from competition day to the day that PSNH ceases to provide transition service and PSNH's actual, prudent, and reasonable costs of providing such power as determined by the commission shall first be separated between the 2 groups of customers described in subparagraphs (b)(1)(B) and (b)(1)(C), used first to offset any differences described in subparagraph (b)(1)(B), and the net then reconciled for each group of customers either by changing the recovery end date, or by decreasing the stranded cost recovery charge, or if the recovery end date has passed, by implementing some other form of equitable reconciliation, as the commission finds to be in the public interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) The commission shall retain the authority to reject any or all bids for transition service at its sole discretion if it finds such action to be in the public interest.  Except as specifically provided in this section, the commission shall not accept any bid or implement any pricing strategy for transition service that creates any deferrals;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) The selection of a provider or providers of default service prior to 24 months after initial transition service end day may be combined with the selection of a provider or providers of transition service to the extent that the commission finds it to be in the public interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) No amount shall be securitized which was not listed as part of the $688,000,000 proposed for securitization in the April 19 order, as reduced by any subsequent amortization;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Customer savings shall be not less than the total amount of $450,000,000, excluding savings from rate reduction financing and merger savings, including the $367,000,000 contained in the original proposed settlement, and the $6,200,000 resulting from the settlement of issues pertaining to New Hampshire Electric Cooperative, Inc. A commitment by PSNH to all of the following actions shall be deemed to satisfy this condition:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) PSNH shall credit customers with the higher return associated with accumulated deferred income taxes (ADITs) as proposed in PSNH's May 1, 2000 filing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) PSNH shall credit customers with the value derived from using its own assets to provide transition service for a period of 9 months;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) PSNH shall extend from 30 months to 33 months the period during which the delivery service charge, exclusive of Hydro Quebec transmission support payments, is fixed at 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) PSNH shall absorb the first $7,000,000 of difference of costs that results in the event that transition service costs during the 12 months following the initial transition service end day exceed the transition service price for that 12 months, as provided in RSA 369-B:3,IV(b)(1)(B)(i);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) PSNH shall reduce the maximum amount of necessary and prudent costs associated with the issuance of and closing on the securitization financing and any premiums associated with the retirement of debt and preferred stock from these proceeds that may be recovered from $17,000,000 to $15,000,000. PSNH shall include in its costs the first $700,000 of the costs of the office of the state treasurer related to reviewing and issuing the rate reduction bonds;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) PSNH agrees to move the Recovery End Date (RED date) to 1 month earlier than it would otherwise be;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(G) PSNH agrees that if competition day has not occurred by October 1, 2000, then effective October 1, 2000 PSNH shall temporarily reduce its current effective total rates (base rates plus FPPAC rates) by 5 percent across the board until either competition day or April 1, 2001, whichever occurs earlier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In the event that PSNH or its parent company is acquired or otherwise sold or merged:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Such merger, acquisition, or sale shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission under RSA 369, RSA 374, RSA 378 or other relevant provisions of law, and the merger, acquisition, or sale shall be approved only if it is shown to be in the public interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) In recognition of the extraordinary benefits provided to PSNH from rate reduction financing, should PSNH or its parent company be acquired or otherwise sold or merged, such merger, acquisition or sale shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission under the standard set forth in the original proposed settlement.  The commission may approve such a merger if such approval results in the receipt by PSNH customers of a just and reasonable amount of the cost savings that result from such merger, acquisition or sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) No acquisition premium paid by an acquiring company for the assets or securities of any acquired company, resulting from any such merger, acquisition or sale, may in any way increase rates at any time from what they would have been without the acquisition premium;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The delivery service charge, exclusive of the Hydro-Quebec transmission support payments, shall be fixed for a period of 33 months from competition day at $0.028 per kilowatt-hour;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The total system benefits charge shall be no greater than $0.003 per kilowatt-hour for 33 months from competition day divided between low-income assistance and energy efficiency/conservation programs.  In the event that the commission finds that a significant amount of unencumbered dollars have accumulated in either program, and are not needed for program purposes, the commission shall refund such unencumbered dollars to ratepayers in a timely manner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) All currently existing opportunities shall be continued for retail customers to generate or acquire electricity for their own use, other than through retail electric service, without an exit fee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) To the maximum extent allowed by federal law, non-discriminatory, open access to PSNH's transmission system shall be available to customers, electricity suppliers, marketers, aggregators, and municipal electric utilities, with charges based only on rates set by federal regulations, plus the actual cost of service for any services not subject to federal price regulation plus, for retail customers, applicable stranded cost recovery charges, RRB charges, systems benefit charges, and taxes;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) The stranded cost recovery charge, averaged over all customers, shall not exceed $0.0340 per kilowatt-hour.  Any changes in the delivery service charge, stranded cost recovery charge, transition service charge, systems benefit charge, or any other charge between the estimated amounts in the April 19 order and 24 months after competition day shall be applied as an equal change in the cost per kilowatt-hour for all rate classes to which they apply;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) The commission shall not order changes in the total rates of customers taking service under special contracts approved pursuant to RSA 378:18 for the duration of those special contracts in effect as of May 1, 2000.  Special contract customers selecting option 2 of the original proposed settlement shall have the energy charges under the contract reduced by the initial transition service price;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(11) During any sale of electricity generation assets required by this settlement, neither PSNH, nor any affiliate of PSNH, nor any company that would become an affiliate of PSNH if an announced merger, acquisition or sale were to be consummated, may bid for those assets;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(12) During any competitive bid process to determine a provider or providers of transition service, or of default service to any customer belonging to a rate class that at the time of service is eligible to receive transition service, neither PSNH, nor any affiliate of PSNH, nor any company that would become an affiliate of PSNH if an announced merger, acquisition or sale were to be consummated, may bid to provide such service;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(13) The commission shall administer the liquidation of any electricity generation assets required to be sold by the settlement.  Any sale of assets located in the state of New Hampshire that are administered by the commission pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted in this state.  The commission shall select the independent, qualified asset sale specialist who will conduct the asset sale process.  PSNH shall be allowed to comment prior to the selection of any such specialist;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(14) The commission shall administer any competitive bid process for transition service or default service required by the settlement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(15) Subject to the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in the event that the commission either rejects a proposed sale of Seabrook, or fails to act on such application within 180 days after North Atlantic Energy Corporation's (NAEC's) proposed sale application is filed with the commission, and the failure of the sale is through no fault of Northeast Utilities (NU) or PSNH, NAEC's return on equity shall be increased from 7 percent to 150 basis points more than the average 10-year Treasury bond yield for the preceding 6 months, but not less than 7 percent nor more than 11 percent, and then readjusted accordingly at the end of every 6 month period;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(16) No finance order shall be final or effective until PSNH and NU have agreed to dismiss with prejudice on competition day PSNH's and NU's claims and causes of action in all pending litigation associated with the implementation of RSA 374-F, including civil action No. 97-97-JD (New Hampshire) / 97-121 L (Rhode Island);  and/or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Authorize the issuance of rate reduction bonds in an amount sufficient to fund stranded costs, deferrals, transaction costs, tax liabilities, employee protections, payments in lieu of taxes, and other expenditures as contemplated in the 2015 settlement proposal, if approved by the commission, or if the commission orders divestiture of all or some of PSNH's generation assets.  The net benefits of accumulated deferred income taxes relating to amounts that will be recovered through any such issuance of rate reduction bonds shall be credited to retail customers by reducing the amount of such rate reduction bonds that would otherwise be issued by the net present value of the related tax cash flows, using a discount rate equal to the expected interest rate on such rate reduction bonds.  This authorization is in addition to any amount authorized in subparagraph (a) or (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any finance order that expressly states each and every one of the conditions as set forth in RSA 369-B:3, IV, if any, and finds that the finance order is consistent with all of these conditions, shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions and requirements of RSA 369-B:3, IV.  If such finance order so satisfies the conditions, if any, and requirements of RSA 369-B:3, IV and satisfies the other requirements of this chapter, then such finance order shall be deemed to be authorized by, and issued pursuant to, this chapter.
