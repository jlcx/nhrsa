&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:12 Verification of Emissions From Biomass Sources. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any source seeking to qualify using an eligible biomass technology shall verify emissions in accordance with the following methods:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For nitrogen oxide emissions, the source shall install and operate a continuous emissions monitor that meets departmental standards as codified in rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For particulate matter emissions, the source shall conduct an annual stack test in accordance with methods approved by the department.  Upon completion of 3 annual tests which demonstrate compliance, the source may request of the department for a decrease in the frequency of testing, but to not less than once every 3 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each such source shall file with the department and the commission within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter an affidavit and documentation attesting to the source's average NOx emission rate for such quarter and the most recent particulate matter stack test results.  For purposes of initial certification under RSA 362-F:6, the results of a stack test may be filed with the department at any time to demonstrate compliance with both the particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions standards.  Within 30 days of a filing, the department shall provide verification of the emissions reported in the filing to the commission.
