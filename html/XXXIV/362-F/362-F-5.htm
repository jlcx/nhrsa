<codesect>
Commencing in January 2011, 2018, and 2025 the commission shall conduct a review of the class requirements in RSA 362-F:3 and other aspects of the electric renewable portfolio standard program established by this chapter.  Thereafter, the commission shall make a report of its findings to the general court by November 1, 2011, 2018, and 2025, respectively, including any recommendations for changes to the class requirements or other aspects of the electric renewable portfolio standard program.  The commission shall review, in light of the purposes of this chapter and with due consideration of the importance of stable long-term policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The adequacy or potential adequacy of sources to meet the class requirements of RSA 362-F:3;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The class requirements of all sources in light of existing and expected market conditions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The potential for addition of a thermal energy component to the electric renewable portfolio standard;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Increasing the class requirements relative to classes I and II beyond 2025;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The possible introduction of any new classes such as an energy efficiency class or the consolidation of existing ones;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The timeframe and manner in which new renewable class I and II sources might transition to and be treated as existing renewable sources and if appropriate, how corresponding portfolio standards of new and existing sources might be adjusted;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The experience with and an evaluation of the benefits and risks of using multi-year purchase agreements for certificates, along with purchased power, relative to meeting the purposes and goals of this chapter at the least cost to consumers and in consideration of the restructuring policy principles of RSA 374-F:3;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Alternative methods for renewable portfolio standard compliance, such as competitive procurement through a centralized entity on behalf of all consumers in all areas of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The distribution of the renewable energy fund established in RSA 362-F:10.
