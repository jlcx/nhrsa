&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Renewable energy generation technologies can provide fuel diversity to the state and New England generation supply through use of local renewable fuels and resources that serve to displace and thereby lower regional dependence on fossil fuels.  This has the potential to lower and stabilize future energy costs by reducing exposure to rising and volatile fossil fuel prices.  The use of renewable energy technologies and fuels can also help to keep energy and investment dollars in the state to benefit our own economy.  In addition, employing low emission forms of such technologies can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions transported into New Hampshire and also generated in the state, thereby improving air quality and public health, and mitigating against the risks of climate change.  It is therefore in the public interest to stimulate investment in low emission renewable energy generation technologies in New England and, in particular, New Hampshire, whether at new or existing facilities.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Eligible biomass technologies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Solar thermal energy;  if the solar thermal energy output is in the form of useful thermal energy only if the unit began operation after January 1, 2013.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Class II sources to the extent that they are not otherwise used to satisfy the minimum portfolio standards of other classes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The incremental new production of electricity in any year from an eligible biomass or methane source or any hydroelectric generating facility licensed or exempted by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), regardless of gross nameplate capacity, over its historical generation baseline, provided the commission certifies demonstrable completion of capital investments attributable to the efficiency improvements, additions of capacity, or increased renewable energy output that are sufficient to, were intended to, and can be demonstrated to increase annual renewable electricity output.  The determination of incremental production shall not be based on any operational changes at such facility but rather on capital investments in efficiency improvements or additions of capacity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The production of electricity from a class III or IV source that has begun operation as a new facility by demonstrating that 80 percent of its resulting tax basis of the source's plant and equipment, but not its property and intangible assets, is derived from capital investment directly related to restoring generation or increasing capacity including department permitting requirements for new plants.  Such production shall not qualify for class III or IV certificates.  Commencing July 1, 2013, a class III source eligible as a class I source under this subparagraph or subparagraph (i) may submit a notice to the commission electing to be a class III source instead of a class I source.  Once such notice is given, the production from such a source shall qualify for class III certificates, provided the source meets the other requirements of a class III eligible biomass technology.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) The production of electricity from any fossil-fueled generating facility that originally commenced operation prior to January 1, 2006, if after January 1, 2012 such facility co-fires with class I eligible biomass fuels to displace the combustion of an amount of fossil fuels.  The portion of the total electrical energy output that qualifies as class I from a facility in a given time period shall be the fraction of electrical production derived from the combustion of biomass fuels based on the heat input at the facility in that time period as determined by the commission in consultation with the department.  To qualify under this paragraph, the electricity generation facility that co-fires with biomass fuels shall:

The quantity of reductions required shall be the fraction of electrical production derived from the combustion of biomass fuels, as determined under this paragraph, multiplied by the difference between the generation unit's NOx emissions rate and the 0.075 lbs/Mmbtu rate.  The plan shall contain reductions, in the aggregate or individually, in NOx emissions from other emission sources under the jurisdiction of the department and demonstrate that the reductions will be quantifiable.  The department shall expeditiously review the plan and, if approved, provide such information as it deems relevant to the commission.  The application submitted to the commission under RSA 362-F:11 shall inform the commission of the plan and the commission shall certify the source in accordance with the plan approved by the department;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Either have an average particulate emission rate, as measured and verified under RSA 362-F:12, of less than or equal to 0.02 lbs/Mmbtu or be a participant in a plan approved by the department for reductions in particulate matter emissions from emission sources owned by or affiliated with the co-firing entity.  The quantity of reductions required shall be the fraction of electrical production derived from the combustion of biomass fuels, as determined under this paragraph, multiplied by the difference between the generation unit's particulate matter emissions rate and the 0.02 lbs/Mmbtu rate.  The plan shall contain reductions, in the aggregate or individually, in particulate matter emissions from other emission sources under the jurisdiction of the department and demonstrate that the reductions will be quantifiable.  The department shall expeditiously review the plan and, if approved, provide such information as it deems relevant to the commission.  The application submitted to the commission under RSA 362-F:11 shall inform the commission of the plan and the commission shall certify the source in accordance with the plan approved by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Biomass renewable energy technologies producing useful thermal energy that began operation after January 1, 2013 provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the unit is a biomass unit rated between 3 and 30 Mmbtu/hr design gross heat input, it shall have an average particulate emission rate of less than or equal to 0.10 lbs/Mmbtu as measured and verified by conducting and reporting the results of a one-time initial stack test in accordance with methods approved by the department;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the unit is a biomass unit rated equal to or greater than 30 Mmbtu/hr design gross heat input, it shall have an average particulate emission rate of less than or equal to 0.02 lbs/Mmbtu as measured and verified under RSA 362-F:12;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:5 Commission Review and Report. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Commencing in January 2011, 2018, and 2025 the commission shall conduct a review of the class requirements in RSA 362-F:3 and other aspects of the electric renewable portfolio standard program established by this chapter.  Thereafter, the commission shall make a report of its findings to the general court by November 1, 2011, 2018, and 2025, respectively, including any recommendations for changes to the class requirements or other aspects of the electric renewable portfolio standard program.  The commission shall review, in light of the purposes of this chapter and with due consideration of the importance of stable long-term policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The adequacy or potential adequacy of sources to meet the class requirements of RSA 362-F:3;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The class requirements of all sources in light of existing and expected market conditions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The potential for addition of a thermal energy component to the electric renewable portfolio standard;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Increasing the class requirements relative to classes I and II beyond 2025;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The possible introduction of any new classes such as an energy efficiency class or the consolidation of existing ones;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The timeframe and manner in which new renewable class I and II sources might transition to and be treated as existing renewable sources and if appropriate, how corresponding portfolio standards of new and existing sources might be adjusted;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The experience with and an evaluation of the benefits and risks of using multi-year purchase agreements for certificates, along with purchased power, relative to meeting the purposes and goals of this chapter at the least cost to consumers and in consideration of the restructuring policy principles of RSA 374-F:3;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Alternative methods for renewable portfolio standard compliance, such as competitive procurement through a centralized entity on behalf of all consumers in all areas of the state.

<center><h3>Section 362-F:6</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:6 Renewable Energy Certificates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The electric renewable portfolio standard program established in this chapter shall utilize the regional generation information system (GIS) of energy certificates administered by ISO-New England and the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) or their successors.  If the regional GIS certificate tracking program administered by the ISO-New England is no longer operational or accessible, the commission shall develop an alternative certificate program, after public notice and hearing, designed to provide at least the same information on the type and generation of renewable energy resources as the GIS certificate tracking program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall establish procedures by which electricity and useful thermal energy production not tracked by ISO-New England from customer-sited sources, including behind the meter production, may be included within the certificate program, provided such sources are located in New Hampshire.  The procedures may include the aggregation of sources and shall be compatible with procedures of the certificate program administrator, where possible.  The production shall be monitored and verified by an independent entity designated by the commission, which may include electric distribution companies, or by such other means as the commission finds adequate in verifying that such production is occurring.  For customer-sited sources under 15 kilowatts in capacity, the commission shall not require the independent monitors to perform an annual site visit, and shall allow the owner of the customer-sited source to electronically report production monthly to an independent monitor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The commission shall establish a methodology to estimate the total yearly production for customer-sited sources that are net metered under RSA 362-A:9 and for which class I or II certificates are not issued.  For purposes of estimation, the commission shall use a capacity factor rating of 20 percent for each installation and shall keep class II production separate from class I production.  Providers of electricity required to obtain and retire certificates under RSA 362-F:3 shall receive an annual credit for such production.  By February 28 of each year, the commission shall compute and make public credit percentages that are equal to the estimated production for the prior calendar year in each class divided by the total amount of electricity supplied by providers of electricity to end-use customers in the prior calendar year, with the result converted to a percentage.  Each provider may then, at the time of its annual report filing under RSA 362-F:8, claim a class I and a class II certificate credit equal to the credit percentage times the total megawatt-hours of electricity supplied by the provider to its end-use customers the prior calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission shall designate in a timely manner New Hampshire eligible renewable sources together with any conditions pursuant to this chapter to the certificate program administrator under paragraph I, with such sources being the recipient of all certificates issued for purpose of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Certificates issued for purposes of complying with this chapter shall come from sources within the New England control area unless the source is located in a synchronous control area adjacent to the New England control area and the energy produced by the source is actually delivered into the New England control area for consumption by New England customers.  The delivery of such energy from the source into the New England control area shall be verified by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A unit-specific bilateral contract for sale and delivery of a source's electrical energy to the New England control area that is in place for the time period during which renewable certificates are generated;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Confirmation from ISO-New England that the sale of the renewable energy was actually settled in the ISO market system;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Confirmation through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation tagging system that the import of energy into the New England control area actually occurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commission may impose such other requirements as it deems appropriate, including methods of confirming actual delivery of the electrical energy into the New England control area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A qualified producer of useful thermal energy shall provide for the metering of useful thermal energy produced in order to calculate the quantity of megawatt-hours for which renewable energy certificates are qualified, and to report to the public utilities commission under rules adopted pursuant to RSA 362-F:13.  Monitoring, reporting, and calculating the useful thermal energy produced in each quarter shall be expressed in megawatt-hours, where each 3,412,000 BTUs of useful thermal energy is equivalent to one megawatt-hour.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:7 Sale, Exchange, and Use of Certificates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A certificate may be sold or otherwise exchanged by the source to which it was initially issued or by any other person or entity that acquires the certificate.  A certificate may only be used once for compliance with the requirements of this chapter.  It may not be used for compliance with this chapter if it has been or will be used for compliance with any similar requirements of another non-federal jurisdiction, or otherwise sold, retired, claimed, or represented as part of any other electrical energy output or sale.  Certificates shall only be used by providers of electricity for compliance with the requirements of RSA 362-F:3 in the year in which the generation represented by the certificate was produced, except that unused certificates of the proper class issued for production during the prior 2 years may be used to meet up to 30 percent of a provider's requirements for a given class obligation in the current year of compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Certificates from behind-the-meter distributed generation shall be initially issued to the owner of the customer-sited source or its designee, regardless of whether the source has received assistance from the renewable energy fund established in RSA 362-F:10.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:9 Purchased Power Agreements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the request of one or more electric distribution companies and after notice and hearing, the commission may authorize such company or companies to enter into multi-year purchase agreements with renewable energy sources for certificates, in conjunction with or independent of purchased power agreements from such sources, to meet reasonably projected renewable portfolio requirements and default service needs to the extent of such requirements, if it finds such agreements or such an approach, as may be conditioned by the commission, to be in the public interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining the public interest, the commission shall find that the proposal is, on balance, substantially consistent with the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The efficient and cost-effective realization of the purposes and goals of this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The restructuring policy principles of RSA 374-F:3;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The extent to which such multi-year procurements are likely to create a reasonable mix of resources, in combination with the company's overall energy and capacity portfolio, in light of the energy policy set forth in RSA 378:37 and either the distribution company's integrated least cost resource plan pursuant to RSA 378:37-41, if applicable, or a portfolio management strategy for default service procurement that balances potential benefits and risks to default service customers;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The extent to which such procurement is conducted in a manner that is administratively efficient and promotes market-driven competitive innovations and solutions;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Economic development and environmental benefits for New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission may authorize one or more distribution companies to coordinate or delegate procurement processes under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Rural electric cooperatives for which a certificate of deregulation is on file with the commission shall not be required to seek commission authorization for multi-year purchased power agreements or certificate purchase agreements under this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:10 Renewable Energy Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established a renewable energy fund.  This nonlapsing, special fund shall be continually appropriated to the commission to be expended in accordance with this section.  The state treasurer shall invest the moneys deposited therein as provided by law.  Income received on investments made by the state treasurer shall also be credited to the fund.  All payments to be made under this section shall be deposited in the fund.  The moneys paid into the fund under paragraph II of this section, excluding class II moneys, shall be used by the commission to support thermal and electrical renewable energy initiatives.  Class II moneys shall primarily be used to support solar energy technologies in New Hampshire.  All initiatives supported out of these funds shall be subject to audit by the commission as deemed necessary.  All fund moneys including those from class II may be used to administer this chapter, but all new employee positions shall be approved by the fiscal committee of the general court.  No new employees shall be hired by the commission due to the inclusion of useful thermal energy in class I production.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In lieu of meeting the portfolio requirements of RSA 362-F:3 for a given year if, and to the extent sufficient certificates are not otherwise available at a price below the amounts specified in this paragraph, an electricity provider may, at the time of report submission for that year under RSA 362-F:8, make payment to the commission at the following rates for each megawatt-hour not met for a given class obligation through the acquisition of certificates:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Class I--$55, except for that portion of the class electric renewable portfolio standards to be met by qualifying renewable energy technologies producing useful thermal energy under RSA 362-F:3 which shall be $25 beginning January 1, 2013.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class II--$55.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class III--$31.50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Class IV--$26.50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Beginning in 2013, the commission shall adjust these rates by January 31 of each year using the Consumer Price Index as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for classes III and IV and  1/2 of such Index for classes I and II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In lieu of the adjustments under subparagraph (a) for class III in 2015, 2016 and 2017, the class rate in each of those years shall be $45.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) By January 31, 2018 the commission shall compute the 2018 class III rate to equal the rate that would have resulted in 2018 by the application of subparagraph (a) to the 2013 rate and each subsequent year's rate to 2018.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In 2019 and thereafter, the class III rate shall be determined by application of subparagraph (a) to the prior year's rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission shall make an annual report by October 1 of each year, beginning in 2009, to the legislative oversight committee on electric utility restructuring established under RSA 374-F:5, the house science, technology and energy committee, and the senate energy and natural resources committee detailing how the renewable energy fund is being used and any recommended changes to such use.  The report shall also include information on the total peak generating capacity that is net energy metered under RSA 362-A:9 within the franchise area of each electric distribution utility, and the percentage this represents of the amount that is allowed to be net metered within each franchise area.  Information shall be provided on net metered group host registrations and the associated customer groups, including number and location of group host facilities, generation by renewable source and size of facility, and group load served by such facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The public utilities commission shall make and administer a one-time incentive payment of $3 per watt of nominal generation capacity up to a maximum payment of $6,000, or 50 percent of system costs, whichever is less, per facility to any residential owner of a small renewable generation facility, that would qualify as a Class I or Class II source of electricity, has a total peak generation capacity of 10 kilowatts or fewer, begins operation on or after July 1, 2008, and is located on or at the owner's residence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Such payments shall be allocated from the renewable energy fund established in paragraph I, as determined by the commission to the extent funding is available up to a maximum aggregate payment of 40 percent of the fund over each 2-year period commencing July 1, 2010.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commission shall, after notice and hearing, by order or rule establish an application process for the incentive payment program established under paragraph V.  The application process shall include verification of costs for parts and labor, certification that the equipment used meets the applicable safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or Underwriters Laboratory (UL) or similar safety rating agency, and that the facility meets local zoning regulations, and receives any required inspections.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commission may, after notice and hearing, by order or rule, establish additional incentive or rebate programs and competitive grant opportunities for renewable thermal and electric energy projects sited in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. For good cause the commission may, after notice and hearing, by order or rule, modify the program, including reducing the incentive level, created under RSA 362-F:10, V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Consistent with RSA 362-F:10, VI, the commission shall, over each 2-year period commencing July 1, 2010, reasonably balance overall amounts expended, allocated, or obligated from the fund, net of administrative expenditures, between residential and nonresidential sectors.  Funds from the renewable energy fund awarded to renewable projects in the residential sector shall be in approximate proportion to the amount of electricity sold at retail to that sector in New Hampshire, and the remaining funds from the renewable energy fund shall be awarded to projects in the nonresidential sector which include commercial and industrial sited renewable energy projects, existing generators, and developers of new commercial-scale renewable generation in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The commission shall issue requests for proposals that provide renewable projects in the nonresidential sector, which include commercial and industrial sited renewable energy projects, existing generators, and developers of new commercial-scale renewable generation in New Hampshire, with opportunities to receive funds from the renewable energy fund established under RSA 362-F:10.  The requests for proposals shall provide such opportunities to those renewable energy projects that are not eligible to participate in incentive and rebate programs developed by the commission under RSA 362-F:10, V and RSA 362-F:10, VIII.  The commission shall issue a request for proposals no later than March 1, 2011 and annually thereafter, and select winning projects in a timely manner.
