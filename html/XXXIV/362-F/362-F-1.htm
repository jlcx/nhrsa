&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Renewable energy generation technologies can provide fuel diversity to the state and New England generation supply through use of local renewable fuels and resources that serve to displace and thereby lower regional dependence on fossil fuels.  This has the potential to lower and stabilize future energy costs by reducing exposure to rising and volatile fossil fuel prices.  The use of renewable energy technologies and fuels can also help to keep energy and investment dollars in the state to benefit our own economy.  In addition, employing low emission forms of such technologies can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions transported into New Hampshire and also generated in the state, thereby improving air quality and public health, and mitigating against the risks of climate change.  It is therefore in the public interest to stimulate investment in low emission renewable energy generation technologies in New England and, in particular, New Hampshire, whether at new or existing facilities.
