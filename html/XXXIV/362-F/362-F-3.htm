 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2025

*Class I increases an additional 0.9 percent per year from 2015 through 2025.  A set percentage of the class I totals shall be satisfied annually by the acquisition of renewable energy certificates from qualifying renewable energy technologies producing useful thermal energy as defined in RSA 362-F:2, XV-a.  The set percentage shall be 0.2 percent in 2013, 0.4 percent in 2014, and increased annually by 0.2 percent per year from 2015 through 2025.
