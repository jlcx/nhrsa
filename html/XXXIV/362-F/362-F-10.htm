&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-F:10 Renewable Energy Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established a renewable energy fund.  This nonlapsing, special fund shall be continually appropriated to the commission to be expended in accordance with this section.  The state treasurer shall invest the moneys deposited therein as provided by law.  Income received on investments made by the state treasurer shall also be credited to the fund.  All payments to be made under this section shall be deposited in the fund.  The moneys paid into the fund under paragraph II of this section, excluding class II moneys, shall be used by the commission to support thermal and electrical renewable energy initiatives.  Class II moneys shall only be used to support solar energy technologies in New Hampshire.  All initiatives supported out of these funds shall be subject to audit by the commission as deemed necessary.  All fund moneys including those from class II may be used to administer this chapter, but all new employee positions shall be approved by the fiscal committee of the general court.  No new employees shall be hired by the commission due to the inclusion of useful thermal energy in class I production.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In lieu of meeting the portfolio requirements of RSA 362-F:3 for a given year if, and to the extent sufficient certificates are not otherwise available at a price below the amounts specified in this paragraph, an electricity provider may, at the time of report submission for that year under RSA 362-F:8, make payment to the commission at the following rates for each megawatt-hour not met for a given class obligation through the acquisition of certificates:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Class I--$55, except for that portion of the class electric renewable portfolio standards to be met by qualifying renewable energy technologies producing useful thermal energy under RSA 362-F:3 which shall be $25 beginning January 1, 2013.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class II--$55.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class III--$31.50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Class IV--$26.50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Beginning in 2013, the commission shall adjust these rates by January 31 of each year using the Consumer Price Index as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for classes III and IV and  1/2 of such Index for classes I and II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission shall make an annual report by October 1 of each year, beginning in 2009, to the legislative oversight committee on electric utility restructuring under RSA 374-F:5 detailing how the renewable energy fund is being used and any recommended changes to such use.  The report shall also include information on the total peak generating capacity that is net energy metered under RSA 362-A:9 within the franchise area of each electric distribution utility, and the percentage this represents of the amount that is allowed to be net metered within each franchise area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The public utilities commission shall make and administer a one-time incentive payment of $3 per watt of nominal generation capacity up to a maximum payment of $6,000, or 50 percent of system costs, whichever is less, per facility to any residential owner of a small renewable generation facility, that would qualify as a Class I or Class II source of electricity, has a total peak generation capacity of less than 5 kilowatts, begins operation on or after July 1, 2008, and is located on or at the owner's residence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Such payments shall be allocated from the renewable energy fund established in paragraph I, as determined by the commission to the extent funding is available up to a maximum aggregate payment of 40 percent of the fund over each 2-year period commencing July 1, 2010.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commission shall, after notice and hearing, by order or rule establish an application process for the incentive payment program established under paragraph V.  The application process shall include verification of costs for parts and labor, certification that the equipment used meets the applicable safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or Underwriters Laboratory (UL) or similar safety rating agency, and that the facility meets local zoning regulations, and receives any required inspections.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commission may, after notice and hearing, by order or rule, establish additional incentive or rebate programs and competitive grant opportunities for renewable thermal and electric energy projects sited in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. For good cause the commission may, after notice and hearing, by order or rule, modify the program, including reducing the incentive level, created under RSA 362-F:10, V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Consistent with RSA 362-F:10, VI, the commission shall, over each 2-year period commencing July 1, 2010, reasonably balance overall amounts expended, allocated, or obligated from the fund, net of administrative expenditures, between residential and nonresidential sectors.  Funds from the renewable energy fund awarded to renewable projects in the residential sector shall be in approximate proportion to the amount of electricity sold at retail to that sector in New Hampshire, and the remaining funds from the renewable energy fund shall be awarded to projects in the nonresidential sector which include commercial and industrial sited renewable energy projects, existing generators, and developers of new commercial-scale renewable generation in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The commission shall issue requests for proposals that provide renewable projects in the nonresidential sector, which include commercial and industrial sited renewable energy projects, existing generators, and developers of new commercial-scale renewable generation in New Hampshire, with opportunities to receive funds from the renewable energy fund established under RSA 362-F:10.  The requests for proposals shall provide such opportunities to those renewable energy projects that are not eligible to participate in incentive and rebate programs developed by the commission under RSA 362-F:10, V and RSA 362-F:10, VIII.  The commission shall issue a request for proposals no later than March 1, 2011 and annually thereafter, and select winning projects in a timely manner.
