&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 371:4-a Evidence of Compensation to be Paid. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In determining the compensation to be paid hereunder, all relevant and probative evidence on the question of the value of the land or rights to be taken shall be considered.  If the proceeding involves a partial taking, the "before and after test'' shall be considered.  Without limiting the foregoing, evidence of other sales to the condemning utility shall be admitted, providing that the party seeking to introduce such evidence establishes that such sales (1) occurred reasonably close in time to the date of the petition under RSA 371:1, (2) concern relatively similar land or rights, and (3) took place under such circumstances respecting freedom of contract as to be probative.
