&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 371:1 Petition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever it is necessary, in order to meet the reasonable requirements of service to the public, that any public utility should construct a line, branch line, extension, pipeline, conduit, line of poles, towers, or wires across the land of another, or should acquire land, land for an electric substation, or flowage, drainage, or other rights for the necessary construction, extension, or improvement of any water power or other works owned or operated by such public utility, and it cannot agree with the owners of such land or rights as to the necessity or the price to be paid therefor, such public utility may petition the public utilities commission for such rights and easements or for permission to take such lands or rights as may be needed for said purposes.  No public utility may petition for permission to take private land or property rights for the construction or operation of an electric generating plant or an electric transmission project not eligible for regional cost allocation, for either local or regional transmission tariffs, by ISO--New England or its successor regional system operator.

Whenever any business entity organized under the laws of this state, another state, or the United States to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under the federal Natural Gas Act, authorizing it to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline or pipelines and appurtenant facilities within this state, or any petroleum pipeline company doing exclusively an interstate business, shall be unable to acquire necessary lands by purchase, lease or otherwise, it may institute condemnation proceedings as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Said pipeline company shall cause a plan or location of the real estate proposed to be taken to be prepared and a copy thereof filed with the clerk of the superior court for each county in which any of such real estate is located and shall apply by petition to the superior court for the county in which such real estate is located to acquire said real estate for the purposes of such pipeline and to have assessed the damages occasioned by the taking.  Such petition shall state the name and residence so far as known to said pipeline company of all persons claiming ownership of or interest in the real estate proposed to be taken.  Where such real estate is located in more than one county the petition may be filed in either county.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The superior court, upon the filing of any such petition, shall order notice thereof to be given, by publication, to all persons claiming ownership of or interest in such real estate to appear and present their claims at a time and place to be stated in the notice;  and an attested copy of such notice shall be given in hand to, left at the usual place of residence or business of, or sent by registered mail to the last known address of all claimants whose names appear in the petition at least 14 days before the said date of hearing.  The superior court, after notice to all parties interested, shall hear the preliminary questions, if any, and all issues relating to title, and shall determine the rights and interests of any and all parties, and the findings and decree relating to such issues shall be final and subject to review only upon questions of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon final determination of any and all of said questions, the superior court shall, unless the parties elect a trial by jury, appoint a commission consisting of 3 suitable persons to assess the damages occasioned by the taking.  The commissioners, upon reasonable notice to all interested parties and after hearing, shall assess the damages and make report of such assessment to the superior court, and such action shall be taken thereon as justice may require.  If either party shall so elect, before reference of such petition to a commission, the damages occasioned by the taking shall be assessed by jury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In trying any question of damages before said commissioners or by jury, the appraisal for taxation of such real estate, and, in cases where less than the whole interest in real estate is sought to be acquired, the appraisal for taxation of such whole interest, by the selectmen or tax assessors for the tax year in which such application shall have been filed, and for as many preceding years as the commissioners or the court may consider relevant, shall be competent as evidence of value.  The damages as determined shall be awarded to the owner or apportioned among the several owners in accordance with their several interests as determined and judgment shall be entered accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Said pipeline company at any time after filing such petition may enter upon and take possession of the real estate upon providing such security as justice may require to pay any damages occasioned by the entry or to satisfy any judgment which may be rendered on the petition.  The amount of the security and all questions relating thereto may be determined by the superior court upon application of either party.  The title to the real estate shall, upon payment or tender of the damages occasioned by the taking, be vested in the pipeline company.  For purposes of surveying and other investigation, said pipeline company shall be entitled to enter upon any real estate, doing no unnecessary damage;  and the owner thereof may, if the parties are unable to agree, recover any damages sustained by him by reason of any preliminary entry authorized by this section by action at law against said pipeline company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No lands or rights of way or easements therein shall be taken by eminent domain under the provisions of this chapter in any public property, or within the location of any railroad or other public utility company;  provided that such pipeline or pipelines may be constructed under or through any public highway or street, public park or reservation or other public property if the method of such construction, compensation, if any, and the plans and specifications therefor have been approved by the authority having jurisdiction over the maintenance of such public highway or street, public park or reservation or other public property;  and provided further that such pipeline or pipelines may be constructed over or across the location of any railroad or other public utility company by agreement with such railroad or other public utility company or, in the event of failure so to agree, then with the approval of the public utilities commission and in such manner as may be determined by said commission.
