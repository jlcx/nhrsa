I. Said pipeline company shall cause a plan or location of the real estate proposed to be taken to be prepared and a copy thereof filed with the clerk of the superior court for each county in which any of such real estate is located and shall apply by petition to the superior court for the county in which such real estate is located to acquire said real estate for the purposes of such pipeline and to have assessed the damages occasioned by the taking.  Such petition shall state the name and residence so far as known to said pipeline company of all persons claiming ownership of or interest in the real estate proposed to be taken.  Where such real estate is located in more than one county the petition may be filed in either county.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The superior court, upon the filing of any such petition, shall order notice thereof to be given, by publication, to all persons claiming ownership of or interest in such real estate to appear and present their claims at a time and place to be stated in the notice;  and an attested copy of such notice shall be given in hand to, left at the usual place of residence or business of, or sent by registered mail to the last known address of all claimants whose names appear in the petition at least 14 days before the said date of hearing.
