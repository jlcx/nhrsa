&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 371:1-b Acquisition Negotiations;  Reference to Eminent Domain Prohibited. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No public utility, predecessor development entity, or agent of either, shall refer to the use of eminent domain in any landowner negotiations, unless the commission has first specifically authorized its use under this chapter with respect to the affected landowner.  Any landowner may file a complaint with the commission under RSA 365:1 alleging violation of this section.  Upon a finding of violation, after notice and hearing, the public utility or project-sponsoring affiliate shall be fined up to $25,000 which shall be deposited in the general fund.  If a landowner makes an inquiry concerning eminent domain, the public utility, predecessor development entity, or agent of either, may provide the landowner with the commission's contact information without violating this section.
