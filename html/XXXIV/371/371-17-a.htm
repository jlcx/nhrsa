&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 371:17-a License by Notification of New Attachments on Existing Utility Poles. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever it is necessary, in order to meet the reasonable requirements of service to the public, that any public utility other than electric or gas should construct a cable, conduit, or wires and fixtures upon an existing line of poles or towers over, under, or across any of the public waters of this state, or over, under, or across any of the land owned by this state, the public utility shall file written notification with the commission for a license to construct and maintain such cable, conduit, or wires and fixtures.  In this section, "public waters'' means all ponds of more than 10 acres, tidewater bodies, and such streams or portions thereof as the commission may prescribe.  Every corporation and individual desiring to cross any public waters or land for the purposes of this section shall file written notification in the same manner prescribed for a public utility.  The notification shall include a description of the specific geographic and pole locations of the crossing and verification that there is a valid pole attachment license or that an application for a pole attachment license has been submitted to the utility or utilities that own such poles or towers.  The notification shall include an affidavit signed by the responsible officer confirming that the crossing shall be completed in compliance with such pole attachment license and the National Electrical Safety Code.  Upon receipt of such notification, no further inquiries or investigations by the commission shall be required in granting the requested license.
