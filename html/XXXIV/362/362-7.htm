I. In this title:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "End user'' means any telecommunications services customer that is not a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications public utility except that a telecommunications carrier or public utility shall be deemed to be an "end user'' when such carrier uses a telecommunications service for administrative purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Incumbent local exchange carrier'' shall have the meaning as defined in 47 U.S.C. section 251(h).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Excepted local exchange carrier'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An incumbent local exchange carrier providing telephone services to 25,000 or more lines;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An incumbent local exchange carrier providing service to less than 25,000 lines that elects to be excepted, upon the filing with the commission of a written notice advising of said election;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any provider of telecommunications services that is not an incumbent local exchange carrier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP'') service'' means any service that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Enables real-time, 2-way voice communications that originate from or terminate in the user's location in Internet Protocol or any successor protocol;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Requires a broadband connection from the user's location;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Permits users generally to receive calls that originate on the public switched telephone network and to terminate calls to the public switched telephone network.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) "IP-enabled service'' means any service, capability, functionality, or application provided using Internet Protocol, or any successor protocol, that enables a user to send or receive a communication in Internet Protocol format or any successor format, regardless of technology;  provided, however, that no service included within the definition of "Voice over Internet Protocol service'' shall be included within this definition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as set forth in paragraph III, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no department, agency, commission, or political subdivision of the state, shall enact, adopt, or enforce, either directly or indirectly, any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, standard, order, or other provision having the force or effect of law that regulates or has the effect of regulating the market entry, market exit, transfer of control, rates, terms, or conditions of any VoIP service or IP enabled service or any provider of VoIP service or IP-enabled service.  VoIP services and IP-enabled services are not public utility services and a provider of VoIP service or IP-enabled service is not a public utility under RSA 362:2, or an excepted local exchange carrier under RSA 362:7, I(c) and shall not be regulated as a public utility in any manner other than as set forth in paragraph III.
