&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 378:6 Suspension of Schedule. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Pending any investigation of a rate schedule which represents a general increase in rates and the decision thereon, the commission may, by an order served upon the public utility affected, suspend the taking effect of said schedule and forbid the demanding or collecting of the rates, fares, charges or prices covered by the schedule for such period or periods, not to exceed 12 months in all, as in the judgment of the commission may be necessary for such investigation, except as provided in paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as provided in RSA 378:6, IV, for all other schedules filed with the commission, the commission may, by an order served upon the public utility affected, suspend the taking effect of said schedule and forbid the demanding or collecting of rates, fares, charges or prices covered by the schedule for such period or periods, not to exceed 3 months from the date of the order of suspension, but if the investigation cannot be concluded within a period of 3 months, the commission in its discretion and with reasonable explanation may extend the time of suspension for 5 additional months.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a public utility submits a rate schedule which incorporates a newly completed generating facility into the rate base and the capital investment for the new facility exceeds 50 percent of the total capital investment of the public utility, the commission may suspend the schedule as provided in paragraph I, except that such suspension shall not exceed 18 months.  The total capital investment of the public utility shall include the capital investment of the new facility.  The commission may suspend a schedule under this paragraph only once in relation to each new facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If for any reason the commission is unable to make its determination prior to the expiration of 6 months from the originally proposed effective date of a rate schedule, the public utility affected may place the filed schedule of rates in effect, pending expiration of the appropriate suspension period, as provided in paragraph I or II, upon furnishing the commission with a bond in such form and with such sureties, if any, as the commission may determine.  The bond and sureties, if any, shall secure the repayment to the customers of the public utility of the difference, if any, between the amounts collected under said schedule of rates and the schedule of rates determined by the commission to be just and reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any tariff for services filed for commission approval by a telephone utility, except a tariff reviewed pursuant to RSA 378:6, I(a), shall become effective as filed 30 days after filing, unless the commission amends or rejects the filing within the 30-day period.  The commission may, in its discretion and with reasonable explanation, including an explanation of the likely areas of disagreement with the tariff, extend the time for its determination by up to 30 days.  At its discretion, the commission may permit changes to existing tariffs to become effective in fewer than 30 days from the date of filing.

Whenever the commission shall be of opinion, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, that the rates, fares or charges demanded or collected, or proposed to be demanded or collected, by any public utility for service rendered or to be rendered are unjust or unreasonable, or that the regulations or practices of such public utility affecting such rates are unjust or unreasonable, or in any wise in violation of any provision of law, or that the maximum rates, fares or charges chargeable by any such public utility are insufficient, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable or lawful rates, fares and charges to be thereafter observed and in force as the maximum to be charged for the service to be performed, and shall fix the same by order to be served upon all public utilities by which such rates, fares and charges are thereafter to be observed.  The commission shall be under no obligation to investigate any rate matter which it has investigated within a period of 2 years, but may do so within said period at its discretion.

<center><h3>Section 378:11-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 378:11-a Economic Development and Retention Rates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the commission shall establish procedures for the review and approval of tariffs for electric service rates that foster economic development and of tariffs for retention of existing load within the state.  For the purposes of this section the term "economic development rates'' means rates, the purpose of which is to attract new industrial companies to the state and to encourage expansion of existing industrial load that would otherwise not occur in the state.  For the purposes of this section "retention rates'' means rates, the purpose of which is to retain existing industrial load that would otherwise leave the utility.  Such procedures shall provide that all electric public utilities serving retail customers may file with the commission generally available rate schedules for the provision of economic development rates and/or retention rates to industrial customers.  Such rates shall take into consideration eligibility criteria, the effect on the utility's fixed and variable costs, the amount of new demand and energy for electric service involved, the effect on employment within the state, material adverse competitive impact on existing in-state firms, and end-user participation in conservation programs and other state established economic development enhancement programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To ensure fairness in the application of the retention rate to industrial load that is not planning to leave the utility, if the commission finds that it is in the public good, the retention rate may also be offered to a direct competitor of a company that has qualified for such rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Except as provided in paragraph II, retention rates shall be available to a customer only if the utility represents that the load would otherwise have left the utility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Economic development rates shall be available to all new industrial companies to the state and for all expansion of existing load without such representation by the utility, provided that eligibility criteria are met.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) In any rate proceeding subsequent to approval of economic development rates or retention rates, the commission shall not impute to the utility's test year revenues or revenue requirement the difference between the regular tariffed rate and the economic development rate or retention rate provided that those customers qualify for the rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The incremental benefit of the economic development rate, which is the excess of the incremental revenues over the incremental cost attributable to the economic development rate, shall be allocated by the commission between the utility and its other ratepayers in a manner consistent with the public interest, as determined by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The rates established in this section shall not be available after December 31, 2002.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "local calling area'' means the area which may be called from a telephone calling exchange without paying toll charges or access charges.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the commission uses a community of interest standard to limit requests to add additional exchanges to a local calling area, the commission should not reject requests solely because few calls are currently being made between the exchanges that would become local calls if the request were granted.  If few calls are currently being made, the commission should consider the likelihood of significant increases in the number of calls between the exchanges if the request is granted and these calls become local calls, especially where public school district boundaries indicate that this is likely to occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The commission should, as soon as possible after each significant decrease of interstate access charges by the federal government, consider corresponding reductions in intrastate access charges, taking into account both the disadvantages to customers of intrastate access charges that exceed interstate access charges and the disadvantages to customers of increases in charges for basic services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commission should consider reducing intrastate access charges and increasing basic monthly service charges for local exchange carrier telephone utilities that have both a higher intrastate access charge than the state median intrastate access charge and a lower basic monthly service charge than the state median basic monthly service charge for exchanges with similar numbers of telephones within the local calling area.

I. The commission is authorized to require telephone utilities that are also providers of competitive telephone services within New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire to provide information to the commission concerning potential separation or divestiture.  The information shall include the costs and other adverse consequences of requiring the separation of these businesses into 2 separate subsidiaries or the divestiture of one or the other into a completely separate corporate entity.

II. The commission is authorized to require telephone utilities that are required to make services available to competitive resellers to provide information to the commission concerning potential separation or divestiture.  The information shall include the costs and other adverse consequences of requiring the separation or divestiture of the competitive portion of their business which competes with the competitive resellers.  It should be assumed that the separated or divested portion would then be removed from price regulation.

I. In this section, "nonpublic utility provider of telephone services'' includes, but is not limited to, a hotel, motel, hospital, university, or similar place of temporary accommodation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every nonpublic utility provider of telephone services shall display or post on or near the telephone equipment so as to be easily seen by telephone users a notice of the existence of standard and resale charges and the in-room location of information on all of the charges applicable to all of the available telephone services.  These charges shall be separately stated, and shall include, but not be limited to, the following information:

These operating requirements shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The information shall also provide the telephone number of the public utilities commission to which questions or complaints may be directed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That, when contacted for service by the telephone user, the operator-assisted services provider orally identify itself by name prior to the connection of the telephone call or the commencement of any charges.

(b) "Incumbent local exchange carrier'' means a local exchange carrier authorized to do business in the state prior to the passage of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Except as provided in RSA 378:18-b, III, any special contracts for incumbent local exchange carriers providing telephone services shall be filed with the commission and shall become effective 30 days after filing, provided the rates are set not less than:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The incremental cost of the relevant service;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where the telephone utility's competitors must purchase access from the telephone utility to offer a competing service, the price of the lowest cost form of access that competitors could purchase to compete for customers with comparable volumes of usage, plus the incremental cost of related overhead.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commission may, in its discretion and with reasonable explanation, extend the effective date of the special contract by 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, special contracts for toll service provided by incumbent local exchange carriers need not be filed with the commission for its approval in order for the special contract to take effect.  Copies of such special contracts shall be filed with the commission within 7 business days after the special contract's effective date.  The commission may investigate a special contract for toll service to determine whether the rates are consistent with the cost considerations of this section.  If the special contract for toll service is not consistent with the cost considerations of this section, the parties shall either cancel the special contract or agree to revise the rate.
