<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A comparison of source and emissions data between the service's energy mix and the average energy mix of the region available from the Independent System Operator of New England.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each provider of electricity, as defined in RSA 362-F:2, XIV, shall in standard format:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
