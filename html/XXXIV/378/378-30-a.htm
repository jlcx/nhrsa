Public utility rates or charges shall not in any manner be based on the cost of construction work in progress.  At no time shall any rates or charges be based upon any costs associated with construction work if said construction work is not completed.  All costs of construction work in progress, including, but not limited to, any costs associated with constructing, owning, maintaining or financing construction work in progress, shall not be included in a utility's rate base nor be allowed as an expense for rate making purposes until, and not before, said construction project is actually providing service to consumers.
