&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-A:1 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is found to be in the public interest to provide for small scale and diversified sources of supplemental electrical power to lessen the state's dependence upon other sources which may, from time to time, be uncertain.  It is also found to be in the public interest to encourage and support diversified electrical production that uses indigenous and renewable fuels and has beneficial impacts on the environment and public health.  It is also found that these goals should be pursued in a competitive environment pursuant to the restructuring policy principles set forth in RSA 374-F:3.  It is further found that net energy metering for eligible customer-generators may be one way to provide a reasonable opportunity for small customers to choose interconnected self generation, encourage private investment in renewable energy resources, stimulate in-state commercialization of innovative and beneficial new technology, enhance the future diversification of the state's energy resource mix, and reduce interconnection and administrative costs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-A:2-a Purchase of Output by Private Sector. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A limited producer of electrical energy shall have the authority to sell its produced electrical energy to not more than 3 purchasers other than the franchise electric utility, unless additional authority to sell is otherwise allowed by statute or commission order.  Such purchaser may be any individual, partnership, corporation, or association.  The commission may authorize a limited producer, including eligible customer-generators, to sell electricity at retail, either directly or indirectly through an electricity supplier, within a limited geographic area where the purchasers of electricity from the limited producer shall not be charged a transmission tariff or rate for such sales if transmission facilities or capacity under federal jurisdiction are not used or needed for the transaction.  The public utilities commission shall review and approve all contracts concerning a retail sale of electricity pursuant to this section.  The public utilities commission shall not set the terms of such contracts but may disapprove any contract which in its judgment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Fails to protect both parties against excessive liability or undue risk, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Entails substantial cost or risk to the electric utility in whose franchise area the sale takes place, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Is inconsistent with the public good.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon request of a limited producer, any franchised electrical public utility in the transmission area shall transmit electrical energy from the producer's facility to the purchaser's facility in accordance with the provisions of this section.  The producer shall compensate the transmitter for all costs incurred in wheeling and delivering the current to the purchaser.  The public utilities commission must approve all such agreements for the wheeling of power and retains the right to order such wheeling and to set such terms for a wheeling agreement including price that it deems necessary.  The public utilities commission or any party involved in a wheeling transaction may demand a full hearing before the commission for the review of any and all of the terms of a wheeling agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Before ordering an electric utility to wheel power from a limited electric producer or before approving any agreement for the wheeling of power, the public utilities commission must find that such an order or agreement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is not likely to result in a reasonably ascertainable uncompensated loss for any party affected by the wheeling transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Will not place an undue burden on any party affected by the wheeling transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Will not unreasonably impair the reliability of the electric utility wheeling the power.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Will not impair the ability of the franchised electric utility wheeling the power to render adequate service to its customers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-A:9 Net Energy Metering. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Standard tariffs providing for net energy metering shall be made available to eligible customer-generators by each electric distribution utility in conformance with net metering rules adopted and orders issued by the commission.  Each net energy metering tariff shall be identical, with respect to rates, rate structure, and charges, to the tariff under which a customer-generator would otherwise take default generation supply service from the distribution utility.  Such tariffs shall be available on a first-come, first-served basis within each electric utility service area under the jurisdiction of the commission until such time as the total rated generating capacity owned or operated by eligible customer-generators totals a number equal to 100 megawatts, with 50 megawatts of the 100 megawatts allocated to the 4 electric distribution utilities that were subject to the commission's jurisdiction in 2010 multiplied by each such utility's percentage share of the total 2010 annual coincident peak energy demand distributed by those 4 utilities, and 50 megawatts of the 100 megawatts allocated to the state's 3 investor-owned electric distribution utilities, multiplied by each such utility's percentage share of the total 2010 annual coincident peak energy demand distributed by those 3 utilities, all to be determined by the commission and to be utilized by eligible customer-generators located within each such utilities' service territory.  Eighty percent of each utility's share of the 50 megawatts shall be apportioned to facilities with a total generating capacity of not more than 100 kilowatts and 20 percent to facilities with a total generating capacity in excess of 100 kilowatts, but no greater than one megawatt.  The 50 megawatts of capacity shall be made available to eligible customer-generators until such time as commission approved alternative net metering tariffs approved by the commission become available.  No more than 4 megawatts of such total rated generating capacity shall be from a combined heat and power system as defined in RSA 362-A:1-a, I-d.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph I-a repealed by 2016, 33:3 effective as provided by 2016, 33:4.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. No person, owner, developer, installer of an eligible customer-generator facility, business organization, or any subsidiary thereof, shall reserve capacity space in the net metering interconnection queue of more than 20 percent of the total net metering utility-specific allocation pursuant to this section, and the creation of multiple business organizations, including a person, as defined in RSA 366:1, I, by the same shall not defeat this requirement.  On a weekly basis each utility shall make public on its website its total net metering allocation, its reserved net metering capacity, and its installed and operating net metering capacity.  For project applications of greater than 100 kilowatts, each utility net metering interconnection queue application shall include a certification of compliance with the 20 percent requirement, all persons involved in such an application shall sign the certification of compliance, and no application shall be processed where one or more persons involved in the application did not sign the certification of compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Competitive electricity suppliers registered under RSA 374-F:7 may determine the terms, conditions, and prices under which they agree to provide generation supply to and purchase net generation output from eligible customer-generators.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Metering shall be done in accordance with normal metering practices.  A single net meter that shows the customer's net energy usage by measuring both the inflow and outflow of electricity internally shall be the extent of metering that is required at facilities with a total peak generating capacity of not more than 100 kilowatts.  A bi-directional metering system that records the total amount of electricity that flows in each direction from the customer premises, either instantaneously or over intervals of an hour or less, shall be required at facilities with a total peak generating capacity of more than 100 kilowatts.  Customer-generators shall not be required to pay for the installation of net meters, but shall pay for the installation of all bi-directional metering systems as outlined in utility interconnection tariffs or rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) For facilities with a total peak generating capacity of not more than 100 kilowatts, when billing a customer-generator under a net energy metering tariff that is not time-based, the utility shall apply the customer's net energy usage when calculating all charges that are based on kilowatt hour usage.  Customer net energy usage shall equal the kilowatt hours supplied to the customer over the electric distribution system minus the kilowatt hours generated by the customer-generator and fed into the electric distribution system over a billing period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For facilities with a total peak generating capacity of more than 100 kilowatts, the customer-generator shall pay all applicable charges on all kilowatt hours supplied to the customer over the electric distribution system, less a credit on default service charges equal to the metered energy generated by the customer-generator and fed into the electric distribution system over a billing period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When a customer-generator's net energy usage is negative (more electricity is fed into the distribution system than is received) over a billing period, such surplus shall either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Be credited to the customer-generator's account on an equivalent basis for use in subsequent billing cycles as a credit against the customer's net energy usage or bill in a manner consistent with either subparagraph IV(a) or IV(b), as applicable;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as provided in paragraph VI, the customer-generator may elect to be paid or credited by the electric distribution utility for its excess generation at rates that are equal to the utility's avoided costs for energy and capacity to provide default service as determined by the commission consistent with the requirements of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA).  The commission shall determine reasonable conditions for such an election, including the frequency of payment and how often a customer-generator may choose this option versus the option in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Instead of the option in subparagraph V(b), an electric distribution utility providing default service to customer-generators may voluntarily elect, annually, on a generic basis, by notification to the commission, to purchase or credit such excess generation from customer-generators at a rate that is equal to the generation supply component of the applicable default service rate, provided that payment is issued at least as often as whenever the value of such credit, in excess of amounts owed by the customer-generator, is greater than $50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A distribution utility may perform an annual calculation to determine the net effect this section had on its default service and distribution revenues and expenses in the prior calendar year.  The method of performing the calculation and applying the results, as well as a reconciliation mechanism to collect or credit any such net effects with appropriate carrying charges and credits applied, shall be determined by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the commission may establish, on a utility-specific or generic basis, a methodology by which customer-generators may be provided service under time-based, net energy metering tariffs.  The methodology shall specify how a customer's energy usage and generation shall be metered, how net energy usage shall be calculated and any applicable charges applied, and how excess generation shall be credited, consistent with size limits and the terms and conditions and intent of this section and other requirements of state and federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Renewable energy credits shall remain the property of the customer-generator until such credits are sold or transferred.  If an electric distribution utility acquires renewable energy credits from a customer-generator in conjunction with purchasing excess generation, it may apply such generation and credits to its renewable energy source default service option under RSA 374-F:3, V(f).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The commission shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Establish reasonable interconnection requirements for safety, reliability, and power quality as it determines the public interest requires.  Such rules shall not exceed applicable test standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or Underwriters Laboratory (UL);  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Implement the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The commission may by order, after notice and hearing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Waive any of the limitations set forth in this chapter for targeted net energy metering arrangements that are part of a utility strategy to minimize distribution or other costs;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Implement any utility-specific provisions authorized under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Once the commission has established standards for equipment used by eligible customer-generators, electric distribution utilities shall not require any additional standards or testing for transmission equipment as a condition of net energy metering.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Customer-generators shall be responsible for all costs associated with interconnection with the distribution system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. (a) A customer-generator may elect to become a group host for the purpose of reducing or otherwise controlling the energy costs of a group of customers who are not customer-generators.  The group of customers shall be default service customers of the same electric distribution utility as the host.  The host shall provide a list of the group members to the commission and the electric distribution utility and shall certify that all members of the group have executed an agreement with the host regarding the utilization of kilowatt hours produced by the eligible facility and that the total historic annual load of the group members together with the host exceeds the projected annual output of the host's facility.  The commission shall verify that these group requirements have been met, shall review the executed agreements for compliance with this section, and shall register the group host.  The commission shall establish the process for registering hosts, including periodic re-registration, and the process by which changes in membership are allowed and administered.  Net metering tariffs under this section shall not be made available to a customer-generator group host until such host is registered by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as provided in subparagraph (c), the provisions of this section shall apply to a group host as a customer-generator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph V, a group host shall be paid for its surplus generation at the end of each billing cycle at rates consistent with the credit the group host receives relative to its own net metering under either subparagraph IV(a) or (b) or alternative tariffs that may be applicable pursuant to paragraph XVI.  On an annual basis, the electric distribution utility shall calculate a payment adjustment if the host's surplus generation for which it was paid is greater than the group's total electricity usage during the same time period.  The adjustment shall be such that the resulting compensation to the host for the amount that exceeded the group's total usage shall be at the utility's avoided cost or its default service rate in accordance with subparagraph V(b) or paragraph VI or alternative tariffs that may be applicable pursuant to paragraph XVI.  The utility shall pay or bill the host accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Group hosts shall be responsible for any costs necessary to upgrade a utility's information systems in order to implement this paragraph, as determined by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commission is authorized to assess fines against, revoke the registration of, and prohibit from doing business in the state, any group host which violates the requirements of this paragraph and rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. Standard tariffs that are available to eligible customer-generators under this section shall terminate on December 31, 2040 and such customer-generators shall transition to tariffs that are in effect at that time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. No later than 3 weeks after the effective date of this paragraph, the commission shall initiate a proceeding to develop new alternative net metering tariffs, which may include other regulatory mechanisms and tariffs for customer-generators, and determine whether and to what extent such tariffs should be limited in their availability within each electric distribution utility's service territory.  In developing such alternative tariffs and any limitations in their availability, the commission shall consider:  the costs and benefits of customer-generator facilities;  an avoidance of unjust and unreasonable cost shifting;  rate effects on all customers;  alternative rate structures, including time based tariffs pursuant to paragraph VIII;  whether there should be a limitation on the amount of generating capacity eligible for such tariffs;  the size of facilities eligible to receive net metering tariffs:  timely recovery of lost revenue by the utility using an automatic rate adjustment mechanism;  and electric distribution utilities' administrative processes required to implement such tariffs and related regulatory mechanisms.  The commission may waive or modify specific size limits and terms and conditions of service for net metering specified in paragraphs I, III, IV, V, and VI that it finds to be just and reasonable in the adoption of alternative tariffs for customer-generators.  The commission may approve time and/or size limited pilots of alternative tariffs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. The commission shall issue an order initially approving or adopting such alternative tariffs, which may be subject to change or adjustment from time to time, within 10 months of the effective date of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. If any utility reaches any cap for net metering under paragraph I before alternative tariffs are approved or adopted pursuant to paragraph XVII, eligible customer-generators may continue to interconnect under temporary net metering tariffs under the same terms and conditions as net metering under the 100 megawatt cap, except that such customer-generators shall transition to alternative tariffs once they are approved or adopted for their utility pursuant to paragraph XVII.
