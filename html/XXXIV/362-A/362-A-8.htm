The rates established in orders by the commission for the purchase of energy or energy and capacity from qualifying small power producers and qualifying cogenerators under this chapter or under applicable federal law exist under the legislative and regulatory authority of the state and shall be deemed a state approved legally enforceable obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commission shall, in all decisions affecting qualifying small power producers and qualifying cogenerators, consider the following factors in its decisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The economic impact upon the state, including, but not limited to, job loss or creation through the utilization of indigenous fuels for electric generation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The community impact including, but not limited to, property tax payments and job creation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Enhanced energy security by utilizing mixed energy sources, including indigenous and renewable electrical energy production.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Potential environmental and health-related impacts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The impact on electric rates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
