&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 362-A:1 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is found to be in the public interest to provide for small scale and diversified sources of supplemental electrical power to lessen the state's dependence upon other sources which may, from time to time, be uncertain.  It is also found to be in the public interest to encourage and support diversified electrical production that uses indigenous and renewable fuels and has beneficial impacts on the environment and public health.  It is also found that these goals should be pursued in a competitive environment pursuant to the restructuring policy principles set forth in RSA 374-F:3.  It is further found that net energy metering for eligible customer-generators may be one way to provide a reasonable opportunity for small customers to choose interconnected self generation, encourage private investment in renewable energy resources, stimulate in-state commercialization of innovative and beneficial new technology, enhance the future diversification of the state's energy resource mix, and reduce interconnection and administrative costs.
