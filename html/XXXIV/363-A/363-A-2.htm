&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 363-A:2 Assessment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The expenses thus ascertained shall be assessed against the public utilities described in RSA 363-A:1 in the manner provided in this chapter.  The assessment shall be calculated by using the gross utility revenue of all public utilities and 33 percent of the gross utility revenue of rural electric cooperatives for which a certificate of deregulation is on file with the commission and allocating the expenses of the commission to each utility in direct proportion as the revenues relate to the total utility revenues as a whole.  Each such expense allocation shall be assessed against each public utility and rural electric cooperative with a certificate of deregulation on file with the commission in an amount equal to its proportionate share.  The minimum fee shall be assessed to utilities having minimal revenues in such proportion as the public utility commission shall determine to be fair and equitable.
