It shall be the duty of the public utilities commission to calculate the amount to be assessed against each such public utility and each other entity subject to assessment in accordance with RSA 363-A:1 and RSA 363-A:2.  At the beginning of each fiscal year, the public utilities commission shall estimate its total expenses for the fiscal year, and then, based on such estimate, shall calculate the amount to be assessed quarterly on August 10, October 15, January 15, and April 15 of that fiscal year, against each such public utility and other assessed entity in accordance with RSA 363-A:1 and RSA 363-A:2.  The public utilities commission shall then make a list showing the amount due on August 10, October 15, January 15, and April 15 of that fiscal year from each of the several public utilities and other entities assessed under the provisions hereof, and, together with a statement of the full name and mailing address of each such public utility and other assessed entity, shall certify the same.  After the close of each fiscal year, the public utilities commission shall ascertain its actual total expenses in accordance with RSA 363-A:1 and RSA 363-A:2, and then shall adjust the assessment for the first quarterly payment of the new fiscal year for each such public utility or other assessed entity for any underpayment or overpayment by each such public utility or other assessed entity for the prior fiscal year.
