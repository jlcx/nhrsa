&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-E:2 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared to be in the public interest and to be the policy of the state to foster and to promote, by all reasonable means, the provision of adequate markets and facilities for the borrowing of money by municipalities for the financing of small scale power facilities from proceeds of bonds or notes issued by such municipalities, and to assist such municipalities in fulfilling their needs for such purposes by creation of indebtedness and to the extent possible to encourage continued investor interest in the bonds or notes of such municipalities as sound and preferred securities for investment.  It is in the public interest and it is the policy of the state to encourage its municipalities to pursue their independent development of electric power and the financing of small scale power facilities for the production of electric power and to assist them by making funds available at reduced interest costs for orderly financing of such facilities, particularly for those municipalities not otherwise readily able to borrow for such purposes at reasonable rates of interest.  It is further declared that credit and municipal bond market conditions require the exercise of the powers of the state in the interest of its municipalities to further and implement such policies by authorizing the New Hampshire municipal bond bank, established under RSA 35-A, to create a separate division having full powers to borrow money and to issue its bonds and notes to make funds available at reduced rates and on more favorable terms for borrowing by such municipalities through the purchase by such division of the municipal small scale power facility bonds and notes of such municipalities in fully marketable form and by granting broad powers to such division to accomplish and to carry out these policies of the state which are in the public interest of the state and of its taxpayers and residents.

Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any bond or note issued under this chapter shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of the negotiable instruments law of this state, and each holder or owner of such bond or note, or of any coupon appurtenant to such bond or note, by accepting such bond, note, or coupon shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that such bond, note, or coupon is and shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of the negotiable instruments law, subject only to the provision of the bonds and notes for registration.
<br>

IV. Bonds or notes of the division shall be authorized by resolution of the bond bank and may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates;  mature at such time or times, not exceeding, with respect to notes, 8 years from the date of issue of the original notes and with respect to bonds, 50 years from the date of their issue;  provide sinking fund payments;  bear interest at such rate or rates of interest per annum or within such maximum rate;  be in such denomination or denominations;  be in such form, either coupon or registered;  carry such conversion or registration privileges;  have such rank or priority;  be executed in such manner;  be payable from such sources in such medium of payment at such place or places within or without the state;  and be subject to such terms or redemption (with or without premium) as such resolution or resolutions may provide.

Any interest, income, and profits earned or realized on such investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded.  After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income, and profits earned or realized on their investment may be returned to the division for use in any lawful manner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-E:11 Reserve Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The bond bank may create and establish on behalf of the division one or more special funds, hereafter referred to as "small scale power facility bond reserve funds'', and shall pay into each such small scale power facility bond reserve fund any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purpose of such fund;  any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds issued under this chapter to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions of the division authorizing the issuance of such notes or bonds;  and any other moneys which may be available to the division for the purpose of such fund from any other source or sources.  All moneys held in any small scale power facility bond reserve fund are hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds and notes with respect to which such small scale power facility bond reserve fund may be established, as they shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds and notes retired by call or purchase as provided.  Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made and the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged subject to RSA 374-E:10.  The use and deposition of moneys to the credit of such small scale power facility bond reserve fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes.  Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution, such small scale power facility bond reserve fund shall be a fund for all such bonds or notes issued under a particular resolution to provide financing for municipalities without distinction or priority of any such bond or note over another.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Moneys in any small scale power facility bond reserve fund shall not be withdrawn at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such fund to less than the required small scale power facility bond debt service reserve established for such fund, as provided in paragraph IV, except for the purpose of making, with respect to bonds or notes secured in whole or in part by such fund, payment, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums, and sinking fund payments, if any, with respect to such bonds or notes for the payment of which other moneys of the division are not available.  Any income or interest earned by any small scale power facility bond reserve fund resulting from the investment of such fund or any other moneys in such fund may be transferred by the division to its other funds or accounts, to the extent it does not reduce the amount of that small scale power facility bond reserve fund below the required small scale power facility bond debt service reserve for such fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The bond bank shall not at any time issue bonds or notes of the division, secured in whole or in part by a small scale power facility bond reserve fund, if, upon the issuance of such bonds or notes, the amount in such small scale power facility bond reserve fund shall be less than the required small scale power facility bond debt service reserve for such fund, unless at the time of issuance of such bonds or notes the division shall deposit in such fund from the proceeds of the bonds or notes issued, or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in such fund, shall be not less than the required small scale power facility bond debt service reserve for such fund after such issuance.  The bond bank may at any time issue bonds or notes of the division for the purpose of providing any amount necessary to increase the amount in the small scale power facility bond reserve fund to the required small scale power facility bond debt service reserve or to meet such higher or additional reserve as may be fixed by the division with respect to such fund.  In computing the amount of the required small scale power facility bond debt service reserve, investments held as a part of such reserve shall be valued in the manner provided in the required resolution authorizing such bonds or notes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. As used in this section, "required small scale power facility bond debt service reserve'' means, as of any date of computation, the amount or amounts required to be on deposit in the small scale power facility bond reserve fund by the resolution of the division authorizing such bonds.
