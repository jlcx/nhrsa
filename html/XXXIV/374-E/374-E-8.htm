Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested, subject to any agreements with noteholders or bondholders, in such manner as the bond bank shall determine, maturing at such times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment of principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded.  Any interest, income, and profits earned or realized on such investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded.  After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income, and profits earned or realized on their investment may be returned to the division for use in any lawful manner.">
