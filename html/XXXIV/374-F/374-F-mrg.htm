<center><h3>Section 374-F:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-F:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The most compelling reason to restructure the New Hampshire electric utility industry is to reduce costs for all consumers of electricity by harnessing the power of competitive markets.  The overall public policy goal of restructuring is to develop a more efficient industry structure and regulatory framework that results in a more productive economy by reducing costs to consumers while maintaining safe and reliable electric service with minimum adverse impacts on the environment.  Increased customer choice and the development of competitive markets for wholesale and retail electricity services are key elements in a restructured industry that will require unbundling of prices and services and at least functional separation of centralized generation services from transmission and distribution services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A transition to competitive markets for electricity is consistent with the directives of part II, article 83 of the New Hampshire constitution which reads in part:  "Free and fair competition in the trades and industries is an inherent and essential right of the people and should be protected against all monopolies and conspiracies which tend to hinder or destroy it.''  Competitive markets should provide electricity suppliers with incentives to operate efficiently and cleanly, open markets for new and improved technologies, provide electricity buyers and sellers with appropriate price signals, and improve public confidence in the electric utility industry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The following interdependent policy principles are intended to guide the New Hampshire public utilities commission in implementing a statewide electric utility industry restructuring plan, in establishing interim stranded cost recovery charges, in approving each utility's compliance filing, in streamlining administrative processes to make regulation more efficient, and in regulating a restructured electric utility industry.  In addition, these interdependent principles are intended to guide the New Hampshire general court and the department of environmental services and other state agencies in promoting and regulating a restructured electric utility industry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-F:2 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Commission'' means the public utilities commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. "Default service'' means electricity supply that is available to retail customers who are otherwise without an electricity supplier and are ineligible for transition service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Electricity suppliers'' means suppliers of electricity generation services and includes actual electricity generators and brokers, aggregators, and pools that arrange for the supply of electricity generation to meet retail customer demand, which may be municipal or county entities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "FERC'' means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Stranded costs'' means costs, liabilities, and investments, such as uneconomic assets, that electric utilities would reasonably expect to recover if the existing regulatory structure with retail rates for the bundled provision of electric service continued and that will not be recovered as a result of restructured industry regulation that allows retail choice of electricity suppliers, unless a specific mechanism for such cost recovery is provided.  Stranded costs may only include costs of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Existing commitments or obligations incurred prior to the effective date of this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Renegotiated commitments approved by the commission;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) New mandated commitments approved by the commission, including any specific expenditures authorized for stranded cost recovery pursuant to any commission-approved plan to implement electric utility restructuring in the territory previously serviced by Connecticut Valley Electric Company, Inc.;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Costs approved for recovery by the commission in connection with the divestiture or retirement of Public Service Company of New Hampshire generation assets pursuant to RSA 369-B:3-a;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) All costs incurred as a result of fulfilling employee protection obligations pursuant to RSA 369-B:3-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Transition service'' means electricity supply that is available to existing retail customers prior to each customer's first choice of a competitive electricity supplier and to others, as deemed appropriate by the commission.

<center><h3>Section 374-F:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-F:3 Restructuring Policy Principles. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. System Reliability.  Reliable electricity service must be maintained while ensuring public health, safety, and quality of life.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Customer Choice.  Allowing customers to choose among electricity suppliers will help ensure fully competitive and innovative markets.  Customers should be able to choose among options such as levels of service reliability, real time pricing, and generation sources, including interconnected self generation.  Customers should expect to be responsible for the consequences of their choices.  The commission should ensure that customer confusion will be minimized and customers will be well informed about changes resulting from restructuring and increased customer choice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Regulation and Unbundling of Services and Rates.  When customer choice is introduced, services and rates should be unbundled to provide customers clear price information on the cost components of generation, transmission, distribution, and any other ancillary charges.  Generation services should be subject to market competition and minimal economic regulation and at least functionally separated from transmission and distribution services which should remain regulated for the foreseeable future.  However, distribution service companies should not be absolutely precluded from owning small scale distributed generation resources as part of a strategy for minimizing transmission and distribution costs.  Performance based or incentive regulation should be considered for transmission and distribution services.  Upward revaluation of transmission and distribution assets is not a preferred mechanism as part of restructuring.  Retail electricity suppliers who do not own transmission and distribution facilities, should, at a minimum, be registered with the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Open Access to Transmission and Distribution Facilities.  Non-discriminatory open access to the electric system for wholesale and retail transactions should be promoted.  Comparability should be assured for generators competing with affiliates of groups supplying transmission and distribution services.  Companies providing transmission services should file at the FERC or with the commission, as appropriate, comparable service tariffs that provide open access for all competitors.  The commission should monitor companies providing transmission or distribution services and take necessary measures to ensure that no supplier has an unfair advantage in offering and pricing such services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Universal Service.  (a) Electric service is essential and should be available to all customers.  A utility providing distribution services must have an obligation to connect all customers in its service territory to the distribution system.  A restructured electric utility industry should provide adequate safeguards to assure universal service.  Minimum residential customer service safeguards and protections should be maintained.  Programs and mechanisms that enable residential customers with low incomes to manage and afford essential electricity requirements should be included as a part of industry restructuring.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) As competitive markets emerge, customers should have the option of stable and predictable ceiling electricity prices through a reasonable transition period, consistent with the near term rate relief principle of RSA 374-F:3, XI. Upon the implementation of retail choice, transition service should be available for at least one but not more than 5 years after competition has been certified to exist in at least 70 percent of the state pursuant to RSA 38:36, for customers who have not yet chosen a competitive electricity supplier.  Transition service should be procured through competitive means and may be administered by independent third parties.  The price of transition service should increase over time to encourage customers to choose a competitive electricity supplier during the transition period.  Such transition service should be separate and distinct from default service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Default service should be designed to provide a safety net and to assure universal access and system integrity.  Default service should be procured through the competitive market and may be administered by independent third parties.  Any prudently incurred costs arising from compliance with the renewable portfolio standards of RSA 362-F for default service or purchased power agreements shall be recovered through the default service charge.  The allocation of the costs of administering default service should be borne by the customers of default service in a manner approved by the commission.  If the commission determines it to be in the public interest, the commission may implement measures to discourage misuse, or long-term use, of default service.  Revenues, if any, generated from such measures should be used to defray stranded costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commission should establish transition and default service appropriate to the particular circumstances of each jurisdictional utility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding any provision of subparagraphs (b) and (c), as competitive markets develop, the commission may approve alternative means of providing transition or default services which are designed to minimize customer risk, not unduly harm the development of competitive markets, and mitigate against price volatility without creating new deferred costs, if the commission determines such means to be in the public interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f)(1) For purposes of subparagraph (f), "renewable energy source'' (RES) means a source of electricity, as defined in RSA 362-F:2, XV, that would qualify to receive renewable energy certificates under RSA 362-F, whether or not it has been designated as eligible under RSA 362-F:6, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A utility shall provide to its customers one or more RES options, as approved by the commission, which may include RES default service provided by the utility or the provision of retail access to competitive sellers of RES attributes.  Costs associated with selecting an RES option should be paid for by those customers choosing to take such option.  A utility may recover all prudently incurred administrative costs of RES options from all customers, as approved by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) RES default service should have either all or a portion of its service attributable to a renewable energy source component procured by the utility, with any remainder filled by standard default service.  The price of any RES default service shall be approved by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Under any option offered, the customer shall be purchasing electricity generated by renewable energy sources or the attributes of such generation, either in connection with or separately from the electricity produced.  The regional generation information system of energy certificates administered by the ISO-New England and the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) should be considered at least one form of certification that is acceptable under this program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A utility that is required by statute to provide default service from its generation assets should use any of its owned generation assets that are powered by renewable energy for the provision of standard default service, rather than for the provision of a renewable energy source component.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Utilities should include educational materials in their normal communications to their customers that explain the RES options being offered and the health and environmental benefits associated with them.  Such educational materials should be compatible with any environmental disclosure requirements established by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) For purposes of consumer protection and the maintenance of program integrity, reasonable efforts should be made to assure that the renewable energy source component of an RES option is not separately advertised, claimed, or sold as part of any other electricity service or transaction, including compliance with the renewable portfolio standards under RSA 362-F.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) If RES default service is not available for purchase at a reasonable cost on behalf of consumers choosing an RES default service option, a utility may, as approved by the commission, make payments to the renewable energy fund created pursuant to RSA 362-F:10 on behalf of customers to comply with subparagraph (f).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) The commission shall implement subparagraph (f) through utility-specific filings.  Approved RES options shall be included in individual tariff filings by utilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) A utility, with commission approval, may require that a minimum number of customers, or a minimum amount of load, choose to participate in the program in order to offer an RES option.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Benefits for All Consumers.  Restructuring of the electric utility industry should be implemented in a manner that benefits all consumers equitably and does not benefit one customer class to the detriment of another.  Costs should not be shifted unfairly among customers.  A nonbypassable and competitively neutral system benefits charge applied to the use of the distribution system may be used to fund public benefits related to the provision of electricity.  Such benefits, as approved by regulators, may include, but not necessarily be limited to, programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, funding for the electric utility industry's share of commission expenses pursuant to RSA 363-A, support for research and development, and investments in commercialization strategies for new and beneficial technologies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Full and Fair Competition.  Choice for retail customers cannot exist without a range of viable suppliers.  The rules that govern market activity should apply to all buyers and sellers in a fair and consistent manner in order to ensure a fully competitive market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Environmental Improvement.  Continued environmental protection and long term environmental sustainability should be encouraged.  Increased competition in the electric industry should be implemented in a manner that supports and furthers the goals of environmental improvement.  Over time, there should be more equitable treatment of old and new generation sources with regard to air pollution controls and costs.  New Hampshire should encourage equitable and appropriate environmental regulation, based on comparable criteria, for all electricity generators, in and out of state, to reduce air pollution transported across state lines and to promote full, free, and fair competition.  As generation becomes deregulated, innovative market-driven approaches are preferred to regulatory controls to reduce adverse environmental impacts.  Such market approaches may include valuing the costs of pollution and using pollution offset credits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Renewable Energy Resources.  Increased future commitments to renewable energy resources should be consistent with the New Hampshire energy policy as set forth in RSA 378:37 and should be balanced against the impact on generation prices.  Over the long term, increased use of cost-effective renewable energy technologies can have significant environmental, economic, and security benefits.  To encourage emerging technologies, restructuring should allow customers the possibility of choosing to pay a premium for electricity from renewable resources and reasonable opportunities to directly invest in and interconnect decentralized renewable electricity generating resources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Energy Efficiency.  Restructuring should be designed to reduce market barriers to investments in energy efficiency and provide incentives for appropriate demand-side management and not reduce cost-effective customer conservation.  Utility sponsored energy efficiency programs should target cost-effective opportunities that may otherwise be lost due to market barriers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Near Term Rate Relief.  The goal of restructuring is to create competitive markets that are expected to produce lower prices for all customers than would have been paid under the current regulatory system.  Given New Hampshire's higher than average regional prices for electricity, utilities, in the near term, should work to reduce rates for all customers.  To the greatest extent practicable, rates should approach competitive regional electric rates.  The state should recognize when state policies impose costs that conflict with this principle and should take efforts to mitigate those costs.  The unique New Hampshire issues contributing to the highest prices in New England should be addressed during the transition, wherever possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Recovery of Stranded Costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It is the intent of the legislature to provide appropriate tools and reasonable guidance to the commission in order to assist it in addressing claims for stranded cost recovery and fulfilling its responsibility to determine rates which are equitable, appropriate, and balanced and in the public interest.  In making its determinations, the commission shall balance the interests of ratepayers and utilities during and after the restructuring process.  Nothing in this section is intended to provide any greater opportunity for stranded cost recovery than is available under applicable regulation or law on the effective date of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Utilities should be allowed to recover the net nonmitigatable stranded costs associated with required environmental mandates currently approved for cost recovery, and power acquisitions mandated by federal statutes or RSA 362-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Utilities have had and continue to have an obligation to take all reasonable measures to mitigate stranded costs.  Mitigation measures may include, but shall not be limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Reduction of expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Renegotiation of existing contracts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Refinancing of existing debt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A reasonable amount of retirement, sale, or write-off of uneconomic or surplus assets, including regulatory assets not directly related to the provision of electricity service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Stranded costs should be determined on a net basis, should be verifiable, should not include transmission and distribution assets, and should be reconciled to actual electricity market conditions from time to time.  Any recovery of stranded costs should be through a nonbypassable, nondiscriminatory, appropriately structured charge that is fair to all customer classes, lawful, constitutional, limited in duration, consistent with the promotion of fully competitive markets and consistent with these principles.  Entry and exit fees are not preferred recovery mechanisms.  Charges to recover stranded costs should only apply to customers within a utility's retail service territory, except for such costs that have resulted from the provision of wholesale power to another utility.  The charges should not apply to wheeling-through transactions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Regionalism.  New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) should be reformed and efforts to enhance competition and to complement industry restructuring on a regional basis should be encouraged.  New Hampshire should work with other New England and northeastern states to accomplish the goals of restructuring.  Working with other regional states, New Hampshire should assert maximum state authority over the entire electric industry restructuring process.  While it is desirable to design and implement a restructured industry in concert with the other New England and northeastern states, New Hampshire should not unnecessarily delay its timetable.  Any pool structure adopted for the restructured industry should not preclude bilateral contracts with pool and non-pool services and should not preclude ancillary pool services from being obtained from non-pool sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Administrative Processes.  The commission should adapt its administrative processes to make regulation more efficient and to enable competitors to adapt to changes in the market in a timely manner.  The market framework for competitive electric service should, to the extent possible, reduce reliance on administrative process.  New Hampshire should move deliberately to replace traditional planning mechanisms with market driven choice as the means of supplying resource needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. Timetable.  The commission should seek to implement full customer choice among electricity suppliers in the most expeditious manner possible, but may delay such implementation in the service territory of any electric utility when implementation would be inconsistent with the goal of near-term rate relief, or would otherwise not be in the public interest.

<center><h3>Section 374-F:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-F:4 Implementation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission is authorized to require the implementation of retail choice of electric suppliers for all customer classes of utilities providing retail electric service under its jurisdiction.  The commission shall require such implementation at the earliest date determined to be in the public interest by the commission.  However, in no event may the implementation be delayed beyond July 1, 1998 without legislative approval or a finding of public interest by the commission that delay is required due to events beyond the control of the commission or that implementation of retail choice within the service territory of any electric utility would be inconsistent with the goal of near-term rate relief or would otherwise not be in the public interest.  In the event that implementation of retail choice is delayed in the service territory of an electric utility, the electric utility shall continue to provide reliable retail service at the lowest reasonable cost in accordance with state law.  In addition, at the earliest practical date, the commission should make effective the unbundling of components of rates into at least distribution, transmission, and generation for each jurisdictional utility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the effective date of this chapter, the commission shall undertake a generic proceeding to develop a statewide industry restructuring plan in accordance with the above principles, and shall, after public hearings, issue a final order no later than February 28, 1997.  In its order, the commission shall establish the interim stranded cost recovery charge for each electric utility as provided in paragraph VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission shall require all electric utilities subject to its jurisdiction to submit compliance filings, which shall include open access tariffs and such other information as the commission may require, no later than June 30, 1997.  The commission shall investigate and shall approve utility compliance filings, subject to modification by the commission if necessary, after public hearing and subject to a finding that the filings are in the public interest and substantially consistent with the principles established in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A utility having less than a 50 percent share of statewide retail electric distribution sales (measured in kilowatt hours per year) may seek a ruling by the commission that it is in the public interest that implementation of such utility's compliance filing be deferred until compliance filings representing 70 percent of retail electric sales have been or are being implemented.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commission is authorized to allow utilities to collect a stranded cost recovery charge, subject to its determination in the context of a rate case or adjudicated settlement proceeding that such charge is equitable, appropriate, and balanced, is in the public interest, and is substantially consistent with these interdependent principles.  The burden of proof for any stranded cost recovery claim shall be borne by the utility making such claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) In order to facilitate the rapid transition to full competition, the commission is authorized, in its generic restructuring order as provided in paragraph II, to set, without a formal rate case proceeding, an interim stranded cost recovery charge for each electric utility.  Such interim stranded cost recovery charges shall be effective for not more than 2 years from the implementation of utility compliance filings and shall be based on the commission's preliminary determination of an equitable, appropriate, and balanced measure of stranded cost recovery that takes into account the near term rate relief principle, is in the public interest, and is substantially consistent with these interdependent principles.  The commission shall also consider the potential for future rate impacts due to possible differences between interim stranded cost recovery charges and charges that may finally be approved for stranded cost recovery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any utility may seek adjustment of the interim stranded cost recovery charge at any time based on severe financial hardship, as determined by the commission.  The setting of an interim stranded cost recovery charge shall establish no legal, factual, or policy precedent with respect to the final determination of stranded cost recovery by the commission in any subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The interim stranded cost recovery charge established for a utility as provided in paragraph VI may also be adjusted based upon the outcome of rate case proceedings to adjudicate claims for stranded cost recovery pursuant to paragraph V of this section.  Any amounts approved by the commission for stranded cost recovery shall be net of amounts previously collected through interim stranded cost recovery charges.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. (a) The commission is authorized to order such charges and other service provisions and to take such other actions that are necessary to implement restructuring and that are substantially consistent with the principles established in this chapter.  The commission is authorized to require that distribution and electricity supply services be provided by separate affiliates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The portion of the system benefits charge due to programs for low-income customers shall not exceed 1.5 mills per kilowatt hour.  If the commission determines that the low-income program fund has accumulated an excess of $1,000,000 and that the excess is not likely to be substantially reduced over the next 12 months, it shall suspend collection of some or all of this portion of the system benefits charge for a period of time it deems reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Targeted conservation, energy efficiency, and load management programs and incentives that are part of a strategy to minimize distribution costs may be included in the distribution charge or the system benefits charge, provided that system benefits charge funds are only used for customer-based energy efficiency measures, and such funding shall not exceed 10 percent of the energy efficiency portion of a utility's annual system benefits charge funds.  A proposal for such use of system benefits charge funds shall be presented to the commission for approval.  Any such approval shall initially be on a pilot program basis and the results of each pilot program proposal shall be subject to evaluation by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Beginning in 2000, the commission shall submit a report to the legislative oversight committee on electric utility restructuring by October 1 of each year.  The report shall concern the results and effectiveness of the system benefits charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII-a. Any electric utility that collects funds for energy efficiency programs that are subject to the commission's approval, shall include in its plans to be submitted to the commission program design, and/or enhancements, and estimated participation that maximize energy efficiency benefits to public schools, including measures that help enhance the energy efficiency of public school construction or renovation projects that are designed to improve indoor air quality.  The report required under RSA 374-F:4, VIII(f) shall include the results and effectiveness of the energy efficiency programs for schools and, in addition to other requirements, be submitted to the commissioner of the department of education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. An electricity supplier shall be eligible to compete, subject to necessary limitations established by the commission, for open access customers only if affiliated utilities file comparable open access transmission and distribution rates with the FERC or the commission, or both as appropriate, for all of their transmission facilities in New Hampshire and to the extent practicable, all of their distribution facilities in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the commission from otherwise exercising its lawful authority under title 34, in proceedings which relate to the introduction of competition in the retail electric utility industry including the retention of experts and consultants to assist the commission in its investigations and the assessment of such costs against utilities and any other parties to the proceedings, consistent with RSA 365:37 and RSA 365:38.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Any administrative or adjudicative proceeding or public hearing relating to this chapter shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. To the extent that the provisions of this chapter are applicable to rural electric cooperatives for which a certificate of deregulation is on file with the commission, the commission shall exercise its authority with regard to such deregulated rural electric cooperatives only when and to the extent that the commission finds, after notice and hearing, that such action is required to ensure that such deregulated rural electric cooperatives do not act in a manner which is inconsistent with the restructuring policy principles of RSA 374-F:3.  The commission shall have the authority to require that such deregulated rural electric cooperatives participate in proceedings, answer commission requests for information and file such reports as may be reasonably necessary to permit the commission to make an informed finding concerning the relevant restructuring policy principle actions of such deregulated rural electric cooperatives.  Absent such a finding by the commission, the active role of assuring that the restructuring policy principles are appropriately addressed within their service territories shall be reserved to the deregulated rural electric cooperatives.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, deregulated rural electric cooperatives shall be subject to the commission's jurisdiction with regard to those provisions of RSA 374-F pertaining to stranded cost recovery, customer choice, open access tariffs, default service, energy efficiency, and low income programs to the same extent as other public utilities.

Unless electing to do so, an electricity supplier that offers or sells at retail to consumers within this state products and services that can lawfully be made available to such consumers by more than one supplier shall not, because of such offers or sales, be deemed to be a public utility as defined by RSA 362:2.  These requirements shall be applied in a manner consistent with the restructuring principles of this chapter to promote competition among electricity suppliers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Aggregators of electricity load that do not take ownership of power or other services and do not represent any supplier interest are not public utilities pursuant to RSA 362:2, but shall notify the commission of their intent to do business.  Municipalities that aggregate electric power or energy services for their citizens pursuant to RSA 53-E are not public utilities pursuant to RSA 362:2.

As a condition of operation, for a 2-year interim period from the date that competition is implemented in one or more areas of the state, competitive energy suppliers and load aggregators shall submit to the jurisdiction of the commission for mediation and resolution of disputes between customers and competitive energy suppliers or aggregators.  Municipalities that aggregate electric power or energy service for their citizens pursuant to RSA 53-E are not subject to this paragraph.
