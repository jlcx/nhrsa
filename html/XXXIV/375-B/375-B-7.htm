&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 375-B:7 Issuance of Contract Carrier Permits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A permit shall be issued to any qualified applicant therefor, as defined in RSA 375-B:2, VII, authorizing in whole or in part the operations covered by the application, if it appears from the application, or from any hearing held thereon, that the applicant is fit, willing and able properly to perform the service of a contract carrier by motor vehicle, and to conform to the provisions of this chapter and the lawful requirements and rules of the department under this chapter, and that the proposed operation, to the extent authorized by the permit, will be consistent with the public interest and the policy declared in RSA 375-B:1;  otherwise, such application shall be denied.  An applicant seeking authority to transport refuse as defined in RSA 149-M:4, XXIII, however, need not establish consistency with the public interest to be issued a permit.  The department shall specify in the permit the business of the contract carrier covered thereby and the scope thereof and shall attach to it, at the time of issuance and from time to time thereafter, such reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations consistent with the character of the holder as a contract carrier as are necessary to carry out, with respect to the operations of such carrier, the requirements established by the department under the provisions of this chapter;  provided, however, that no terms, conditions, or limitations shall restrict the right of the carrier to substitute or add contracts within the scope of the permit, or to add to his or its equipment and facilities as the development of the business and the demands of the public may require.
