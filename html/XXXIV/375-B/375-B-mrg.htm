&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 375-B:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The business of operating motor vehicles transporting property for hire on the highways of this state affects the interests of the public.  The rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles so operated, and the fact that they are not sufficiently regulated, have increased the dangers and hazards on public highways, and regulation of common carriers and contract carriers as hereinafter defined is necessary to the end that highways may be rendered safer for the use of the general public;  that the use of the highways for the transportation of property for hire may be restricted to the extent required by the necessity and convenience of the shippers and receivers of freight, and that the various transportation agencies of the state may be correlated so that public highways may serve the best interest of the general public.

I. When there is an immediate and urgent need for service in an area and no carrier service is able to meet the need, the department may, without hearing, grant temporary authority for the needed service to a common carrier or contract carrier by motor vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Temporary authority is valid for the length of time specified by the commission in the certificate or permit, but may not exceed an aggregate of 60 days.  A grant of temporary authority may be suspended or revoked for good cause.  A grant of temporary authority creates no presumption that comparable permanent authority will later be granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Temporary certificates and permits are subject to RSA 375-B and to rules adopted by the commissioner relative to RSA 375-B.
