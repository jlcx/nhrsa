<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any contract carrier by motor vehicle, as defined in RSA 375-B:2, VII, in competition with any common carrier shall file with the department the rates or carrier regulations or practices affecting a rate which apply to the service.  However, filing is not necessary if the property is to be transported for a common carrier and the rates charged the public for transportation of this type of property are filed with the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No contract carrier shall charge or receive for any service an amount less than the rates filed with the department.  However, any contract carrier with a public interest permit may file new rates and carrier regulations or practices, or change the highways over which it gives service, by filing notice of the change with the department.
