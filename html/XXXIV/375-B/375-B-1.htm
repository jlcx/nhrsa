&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 375-B:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The business of operating motor vehicles transporting property for hire on the highways of this state affects the interests of the public.  The rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles so operated, and the fact that they are not sufficiently regulated, have increased the dangers and hazards on public highways, and regulation of common carriers and contract carriers as hereinafter defined is necessary to the end that highways may be rendered safer for the use of the general public;  that the use of the highways for the transportation of property for hire may be restricted to the extent required by the necessity and convenience of the shippers and receivers of freight, and that the various transportation agencies of the state may be correlated so that public highways may serve the best interest of the general public.
