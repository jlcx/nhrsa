<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each certificate issued under RSA 375-B:4 or 375-B:5 shall specify the service to be rendered and the routes over which, the fixed termini, if any, between which, and the territory within which the motor carrier is authorized to operate.  The department may impose upon the exercise of the privileges granted by the certificate, at the time of its issuance or from time to time thereafter, such reasonable terms, conditions and limitations as the public convenience and necessity may require;  provided, however, that no terms, conditions, or limitations shall restrict the right of the carrier to add to his or its equipment and facilities over the routes, between the termini or within the territory specified in the certificate as the development of the business and the demands of the public shall require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A common carrier by motor vehicle operating under such certificate may deviate from the route over which it is authorized to operate under the certificate under such general or special rules and regulations as the commissioner may prescribe or when highway conditions are such that operations over such regular routes are impracticable.
