&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When there is an immediate and urgent need for service in an area and no carrier service is able to meet the need, the department may, without hearing, grant temporary authority for the needed service to a common carrier or contract carrier by motor vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Temporary authority is valid for the length of time specified by the commission in the certificate or permit, but may not exceed an aggregate of 60 days.  A grant of temporary authority may be suspended or revoked for good cause.  A grant of temporary authority creates no presumption that comparable permanent authority will later be granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Temporary certificates and permits are subject to RSA 375-B and to rules adopted by the commissioner relative to RSA 375-B.
