<codesect>
If as a result of an investigation in accordance with RSA 366:5 the commission shall find that any public utility is making any payment or about to make any payment or doing or about to do any other thing which substantially threatens or impairs the ability of the public utility to render adequate service at reasonable rates or otherwise to discharge its duty to the public, the commission may apply to the superior court for an order directing the public utility to cease making any such payment or doing such other thing;  and, thereupon, the court shall make such order as the public good may require.
