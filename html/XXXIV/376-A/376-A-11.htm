I. The TNC shall implement a zero tolerance policy regarding a TNC driver's activities while accessing the TNC's digital platform.  The zero tolerance policy shall address the use of drugs or alcohol while a TNC driver is providing prearranged rides or is logged into the TNC's digital network but is not providing prearranged rides, and the TNC shall provide notice of this policy on its website, as well as procedures to report a complaint about a TNC driver with whom a rider was matched and whom the rider reasonably suspects was under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the course of the trip.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of such rider complaint alleging a violation of the zero tolerance policy, the TNC shall suspend such TNC driver's access to the TNC's digital platform as soon as possible, and shall conduct an investigation into the reported incident.  The suspension shall last the duration of the investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The TNC shall maintain records relevant to the enforcement of this requirement for a period of at least 2 years from the date that a rider complaint is received by the TNC.  The suspension shall last the duration of the investigation.
