&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 376-A:9 Disclosures.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every TNC shall disclose in writing to the TNC driver the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The insurance coverage, including the types of coverage and the limits for each coverage, that the TNC provides while the TNC driver uses a personal vehicle in connection with a TNC's digital network.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. That the TNC driver's own motor vehicle insurance policy might not provide any coverage while the TNC driver is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is engaged in a prearranged ride, depending on its terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. That the TNC driver shall contact the driver's personal vehicle insurer or insurance producer and lienholder to advise the insurer or producer and lienholder that the driver will be providing TNC services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. That if the personal vehicle that the TNC driver uses to provide TNC services has a lien against it, using the personal vehicle for TNC services without physical damage coverage may violate the terms of the contract with the lienholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. That if a TNC's insurer makes a payment for a claim covered under comprehensive coverage or collision coverage, the TNC shall cause its insurer to issue the payment directly to the business repairing the personal vehicle or jointly to the owner of the personal vehicle and the primary lienholder on the covered personal vehicle.
