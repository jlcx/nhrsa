<codesect>
The department of transportation may require the railroad to raise any railroad bridge or any overhead highway bridge and, in the case of a highway bridge, to change the approaches thereto so as to make them as nearly level as practicable.  Whenever it is necessary, in complying with such requirement of the department of transportation to raise or lower or otherwise change the location of a highway outside the railroad location, any land needed for that purpose shall be taken, and the damage, if any, to landowners shall be appraised and paid in the manner described in RSA 372.
