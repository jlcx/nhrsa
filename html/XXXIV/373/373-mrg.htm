I. In instances where the state has acquired rail properties, the state shall have the same duty as under RSA 373:1 to provide suitable crossings and other facilities for the accommodation of the public and to provide suitable gates, crossings and other facilities for the accommodation of persons whose lands are divided, or are separated from a highway, by the state-owned railway.

<codesect>
Upon petition of a railroad, the selectmen of a town, or the mayor and council of a city, the department of transportation, after notice and hearing, may require a railroad (a) to separate the grades where a highway and railroad cross at grade or where a railroad crosses another railroad at grade, (b) to change the location of a highway or a railroad in order to avoid or improve a grade crossing or (c) to reconstruct or otherwise alter or improve any existing bridge or underpass and the approaches thereto in instances where separation of grades has been effected, or (d) to improve the approaches to any grade crossing so as to make them as nearly level as practicable where any such action is found necessary in the interest of safety to the railroad or the public.  At any such hearing, the director of the division of motor vehicles shall sit and confer with the department of transportation in an advisory capacity in the determination of the necessity for such reconstruction and the apportionment of the cost of the same.

Any order issued under RSA 373:2 shall provide for the apportionment of the cost (1) between the railroads in interest if the crossing eliminated or improved is a railroad crossing or (2) between the railroad and the state if such crossing is located at the intersection of a railroad and a state highway, trunk line or state-aided highway, or (3) between the railroad and the municipality if such crossing is located at the intersection of a railroad and a highway other than those above specified.  In making such apportionment, the department of transportation shall give due consideration to whether the railroad or the highway was first constructed, to the nature and volume of highway traffic, to the number of trains operated by the railroad at the crossing, and all other relevant facts and circumstances.  After such reconstruction, the abutments and superstructure of the bridge or underpass shall be maintained by the railroad;  but the department of transportation may direct that the wearing surface of a highway at the crossing be maintained by the state or by the town or city whenever it finds that justice so requires.
