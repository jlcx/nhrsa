Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the commission may in its discretion determine who, in addition to those lawyers licensed in the state of New Hampshire to do so, may appear before the commission on behalf of any party, provided, however, that the discretion shall not be exercised unreasonably or in a discriminatory manner.  All parties will be required to adhere to the commission's rules of practice and procedure in addition to any orders of the commission or agreements between the parties, including but not limited to those concerning confidentiality.
