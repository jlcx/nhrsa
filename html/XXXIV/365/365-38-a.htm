The commission may allow recovery of costs associated with utility proceedings before the commission, provided that recovery of costs for utilities and other parties shall be just and reasonable and in the public interest.  For purposes of this section, other parties shall be defined as retail customers that are subject to the rates of the utility and who demonstrate financial hardship;  other parties shall not include New Hampshire municipalities.  Recovery by other parties shall be deemed to be in the public interest when, in any commission proceeding, the other party substantially contributes to the adoption by the commission, in whole or in part, of a position advocated by the other party in that proceeding, or in a judicial review of that proceeding.  Another party shall not recover more than $10,000 from any utility for any single proceeding.  The commission may allow recovery of less than $10,000 depending upon the scope of the proceeding.  The utility shall pay the other party an award of costs if such award is granted by the commission in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the commission and the award is subsequently approved by the governor and council.  The utility shall not be liable for any award of costs except in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the commission.  If the commission proceeding involves more than one utility, the liability of each utility for the award shall be determined by dividing the amount of the award among the utilities in a manner approved by the commission.  If an award of costs is granted in a proceeding involving a change in a utility's rates, the entire amount of the award shall be recovered by the utility in that proceeding.  If an award of costs is granted in a proceeding other than one involving a change in a utility's rates, the entire amount of the award shall be immediately recovered by the utility through measures approved on a timely basis by the commission.
