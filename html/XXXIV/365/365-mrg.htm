&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever any investigation shall be necessary to enable the commission to pass upon any petition for authority to issue stocks, bonds, notes, or other evidence of indebtedness, for authority to operate as a public utility or to expand operations as a public utility, to make extensions into new territory, to discontinue service, to condemn property for flowage rights and dam construction, or for authority to sell, consolidate, merge, transfer, or lease the plant, works, or system of any public utility, or any part of the same, or for any other matter which requires the commission's approval, the petitioner shall pay to the commission the expense involved in the investigation of the matters covered by said petition, including the amounts expended for experts, accountants, or other assistants.  Such expense shall not include any part of the salaries or expenses of the commissioners or of employees of the commission or, unless the proceeding is being conducted pursuant to RSA 38, the fees of experts testifying as to values in condemnation proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the commission institutes a proceeding, or when more than one utility subject to the jurisdiction of the commission shall be involved in a proceeding in which the commission requires the assistance of experts, accountants or other assistants, regardless of whether they petitioned the commission in the first instance, the commission may assess the costs of experts, accountants or other assistants hired by the commission against the utilities and any other parties to the proceeding.  The commission shall not, however, assess any such costs against the office of the consumer advocate or against any voluntary corporation, not-for-profit organization, or any municipality unless the municipality is involved in a proceeding before the commission pursuant to RSA 38.  In the case of a utility, the assessment of those costs shall be based on the annual revenues of the participating utilities in the same manner as issued in assessing the annual operating expenses of the commission, or as appropriate and equitable on a case by case basis.  In the case of a party who is not a utility, the assessment of those costs shall be as appropriate and equitable on a case by case basis.  Such expenses shall not include any part of the salaries or expenses of the commissioners or of employees of the commission or, unless the proceeding is being conducted pursuant to RSA 38, the fees of experts testifying as to values in condemnation proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For investigations or proceedings involving the acquisition, merger, transfer, sale, or lease of the works or system of a public utility, the commission shall not enter into a contract with experts, accountants, or other assistants in an amount greater than $250,000, including any contract extension, without the approval of the governor and council.  For all other investigations or proceedings, the commission shall not enter into a contract with experts, accountants, or other assistants in an amount greater than $100,000, including any contract extension, without the approval of governor and council.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 365:38-a Proceeding Costs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commission may allow recovery of costs associated with utility proceedings before the commission, provided that recovery of costs for utilities and other parties shall be just and reasonable and in the public interest.  For purposes of this section, other parties shall be defined as retail customers that are subject to the rates of the utility and who demonstrate financial hardship;  other parties shall not include New Hampshire municipalities.  Recovery by other parties shall be deemed to be in the public interest when, in any commission proceeding, the other party substantially contributes to the adoption by the commission, in whole or in part, of a position advocated by the other party in that proceeding, or in a judicial review of that proceeding.  Another party shall not recover more than $10,000 from any utility for any single proceeding.  The commission may allow recovery of less than $10,000 depending upon the scope of the proceeding.  The utility shall pay the other party an award of costs if such award is granted by the commission in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the commission and the award is subsequently approved by the governor and council.  The utility shall not be liable for any award of costs except in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the commission.  If the commission proceeding involves more than one utility, the liability of each utility for the award shall be determined by dividing the amount of the award among the utilities in a manner approved by the commission.  If an award of costs is granted in a proceeding involving a change in a utility's rates, the entire amount of the award shall be recovered by the utility in that proceeding.  If an award of costs is granted in a proceeding other than one involving a change in a utility's rates, the entire amount of the award shall be immediately recovered by the utility through measures approved on a timely basis by the commission.
