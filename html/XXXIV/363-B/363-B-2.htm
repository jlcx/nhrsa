&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who receives a notice of intent to terminate service pursuant to RSA 363-B:1 and believes such proposed termination to be unjustified may request, prior to the date specified in the termination notice, a conference with the utility company involved to review the basis for the proposed termination.  The conference with the utility company shall be conducted in person, by writing or by telephone as the customer may elect.  If the customer is dissatisfied with the outcome of the conference he may, within 3 days after the conference if the conference is conducted in person, or within 5 days after the conference if the conference is conducted by writing or by telephone, request a conference with a staff member of the commission to review the basis for the proposed termination.  The conference with the commission may be conducted by writing or by telephone if the customer so elects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event of a request for a conference with the public utility, the public utility shall continue service to the customer for 3 days after the conference if the conference was conducted in person, or for 5 days after the conference if the conference was conducted by writing or by telephone, or to the date specified in the notice of termination, whichever comes later.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. During the conference with the utility company, the utility company shall inform the customer of his right to request a conference with a staff member of the commission.  If the conference with the utility company is conducted in person, the customer shall be furnished a form for requesting a conference with a staff member of the commission during the conference.  If the conference with the utility company is conducted by writing or by telephone, the utility company shall mail the form to the customer by regular mail on the same day as the conference.  In the event of a request for a conference with a staff member of the commission, the public utility shall continue service to the customer until such time as the staff member or the commission determines that termination is justified.
