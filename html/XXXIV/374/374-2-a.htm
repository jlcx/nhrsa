&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374:2-a Alternative to Herbicide Use. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every public utility that uses herbicides to clear or maintain its rights-of-way shall offer, as an alternative to herbicide use, to cut back such vegetation, if requested by the owner of the land on which the right-of-way exists.  The utility shall be permitted to charge the landowners who opt for the cutting of vegetation on their property an amount which has been approved by the public utilities commission and which reflects the increased cost the utility incurs in providing such an alternative.  No utility shall indicate to any such landowner that such a charge may exist until the charge has been approved by the commission.
