(5) Require explicit identification on customer's bills of contributions to and in the event of fund termination, refunds from, any state universal service fund established pursuant to the section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commission, annually, shall assess the penetration rate of basic telephone services.  If this penetration rate ever falls below the national average penetration rate, the commission shall commence an investigation and take steps to enhance telephone market penetration.  The commission, annually, shall assess the success of any action taken by the commission to achieve the purpose of this section.  The public policy goal should be to raise the low income penetration level as close as reasonably possible to the statewide average.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Incumbent local exchange carriers which qualify as excepted local exchange carriers shall report the rates for basic service to the commission within 60 days of the effective date of this paragraph and upon any changes to the rates.
