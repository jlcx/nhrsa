&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374:3-b Alternative Regulation of Small Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "small incumbent local exchange carrier'' means an incumbent local exchange carrier serving fewer than 25,000 access lines.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Solely at its option, a small incumbent local exchange carrier subject to rate of return regulation, and only such small incumbent local exchange carrier, may petition the public utilities commission for approval of an alternative form of regulation providing for regulation of such carrier's retail operations comparable to the regulation applied to competitive local exchange carriers, subject to paragraph III, due to its status as carrier of last resort.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission shall approve the alternative regulation plan if it finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The small incumbent local exchange carrier has 25 percent fewer access lines in service than it did on December 31, 2004;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The plan provides for maximum stand-alone basic local service rates at levels that do not exceed the comparable rates charged by the largest incumbent local exchange carrier operating in the state and that do not increase by more than 5 percent in each of the 4 years after a plan is approved with the exception that the plan may provide for additional rate adjustments, with public utilities commission review and approval, to reflect changes in federal, state, or local government taxes, mandates, rules, regulations, or statutes;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The plan meets intercarrier service obligations under other applicable laws;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The plan preserves universal access to affordable stand-alone basic telephone service;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The plan provides that, if the small incumbent local exchange carrier operating under the plan fails to meet any of the conditions set out in this section, the public utilities commission may require the small incumbent local exchange carrier to propose modifications to the alternative regulation plan or return to rate of return regulation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The alternative regulation plan may allow the small incumbent local exchange carrier to offer bundled services that include combinations of telecommunications, data, video, and other services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Following approval of the alternative regulation plan, the small incumbent local exchange carrier shall no longer be subject to rate of return regulation or be required to file affiliate contracts or seek prior commission approval of financings or corporate organizational changes, including, without limitation, mergers, acquisitions, corporate restructurings, issuance or transfer of securities, or the sale, lease, or other transfer of assets or control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, competitive entry in the service territory of a small incumbent local exchange carrier which has petitioned for approval of an alternative regulation plan, is consistent with the public good for the specific purpose of RSA 374:22-g and approval of such competitive entry shall not require a hearing as required under RSA 374:26.

<codesect>
For the purpose of enabling the commission to perform its duty to keep informed as provided in RSA 374:4, every public utility, before making any addition, extension, or capital improvement to its fixed property in this state, except under emergency conditions, shall report to the commission the probable cost of such addition, extension, or capital improvement whenever the probable cost thereof exceeds a reasonable amount to be prescribed by general or special order of the commission.  For this purpose, the commission may classify public utilities according to the amount of their respective fixed capital accounts, and prescribe a reasonable limitation for each such classification.  In no case shall the minimum amount prescribed be less than  1/4 of one percent of such fixed capital account as of December 31 of the preceding year, or $ 10,000, whichever is the smaller amount.  Reports shall be filed in writing with the commission within such reasonable time as may be prescribed by the commission before starting actual construction on any addition, extension, or improvement.  The commission shall have discretion to exclude the cost of any such addition, extension, or capital improvement from the rate base of said utility where such written report thereof shall not have been filed in advance as herein provided.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374:22-e Service Territories;  Commission Jurisdiction. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If 2 or more telephone utilities find that they provide the same service in the same area or that existing maps create overlapping service territories, the commission, upon application by one or both of the affected utilities, shall define, alter, or establish service territories.  In establishing or altering service territories, the commission shall consider the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Existing service areas;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any voluntary agreements between or among 2 or more such telephone utilities which define the service territories of those utilities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Consistency with the orderly development of the region;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Natural geographical boundaries;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Compatibility with the interests of all consumers;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) All other relevant factors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall have power to exercise the jurisdiction conferred in this section only after due notice to all interested parties and hearing.  After consideration of the factors established by paragraph I of this section, and after making findings that the service territories established or altered are consistent with the public good, the commission shall establish the service territory of each telephone utility.  The service territory thus established shall be sufficiently definite and precise so that its boundaries may be accurately determined.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To the extent consistent with federal law and notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all telephone franchise areas served by a telephone utility that provides local exchange service, subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, shall be nonexclusive.  The commission, upon petition or on its own motion, shall have the authority to authorize the providing of telecommunications services, including local exchange services, and any other telecommunications services, by more than one provider, in any service territory, when the commission finds and determines that it is consistent with the public good unless prohibited by federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining the public good, the commission shall consider the interests of competition with other factors including, but not limited to, fairness;  economic efficiency;  universal service;  carrier of last resort obligations;  the incumbent utility's opportunity to realize a reasonable return on its investment;  and the recovery from competitive providers of expenses incurred by the incumbent utility to benefit competitive providers, taking into account the proportionate benefit or savings, if any, derived by the incumbent as a result of incurring such expenses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374:22-q Public Interest Payphones. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established a public interest payphone fund into which shall only be deposited moneys received pursuant to RSA 471-C:8, IV and this paragraph.  The state treasurer may invest moneys in the fund as provided by law, with interest received on such investment credited to the fund.  Moneys in the fund shall be nonlapsing and continually appropriated to the commission to be used only to fund the maintenance of public interest payphones.  At the end of each biennium, any moneys in excess of $30,000 shall be transferred to the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Public interest payphone'' means a payphone or payphone site which the commission has determined to be necessary in the interest of public health, safety, or welfare, where there would otherwise not be a payphone, in accordance with 47 U.S.C. section 276(b)(2).  The owner or person in control of the payphone site may object in writing to the commission to the designation of the public interest payphone.  The commission shall not designate a payphone or payphone site as a public interest payphone if such objection is received by the commission prior to designation;  if the objection is received after designation, the commission shall remove the designation immediately upon receipt of the objection.  The commission shall make payment of fair compensation from the fund to providers of payphones that have been designated by the commission as public interest payphones, where such providers are required by the commission to maintain the payphones.  No other state or state associated funds shall be used to maintain public interest payphones other than those contained in the fund, without further authorization from the legislature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any public utility or non-utility pay telephone services provider that operates any plant or equipment or any part of same for the conveyance of telephone or telegraph messages that elects to remove the last pay telephone at a site shall provide prior written notice to the commission, to the owner of the property where the payphone is located, and to the public of the intended removal of the payphone.  The provider shall notify the commission and the owner at least 60 days prior to removal.  Posting notice on the payphone at least 30 days prior to removal shall constitute adequate public notice.  The notice shall include notification that any person may file a petition with the commission to designate the payphone as a public interest payphone.  Once a payphone or payphone site has been designated as a public interest payphone, the payphone may not be removed unless the commission removes the public interest payphone designation.  The commission shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, to implement this subdivision.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374:51 Notification by Excavator. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person shall perform an excavation within 100 feet of an underground facility, except in an emergency, without first giving notification as required by this section.  In an emergency, notification shall be given at the earliest practicable moment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At least 72 hours before a proposed excavation, but not including Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, each person required to give notice of an excavation shall notify the damage prevention system referred to in RSA 374:49.  Such notice shall occur no more than 30 days before the proposed excavation is to be made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notice may be in writing, by telephone or by any other reasonable means.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Prior to complying with the notification requirements of paragraph II, an excavator must premark the area as provided in this paragraph, which means identifying the perimeter of the proposed site of the excavation by marking the perimeter in an appropriate manner in the color white paint, stakes, or other suitable white markings on non-paved surfaces.  No such premarking shall be acceptable if the marks interfere with traffic or pedestrian control, or are misleading to the general public.  Premarking shall not be required on any continuous excavation that is over 100 feet in length, or any pole replacement that is within 5 feet of an existing location.  If an excavation is over 100 feet in length or a pole replacement is within 5 feet of an existing location, the excavator shall communicate the perimeter of the excavation by means of a description of the area or construction plans, or have an on-site meeting with affected operators or other suitable means acceptable to the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When making the notification required by this section, the excavator shall identify which of the methods described in paragraph IV will be used to identify the proposed excavation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The excavator's notification shall be valid for 30 calendar days from the date and time of confirmation of notification by the underground facility damage prevention system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If an excavator is aware that blasting will be required during an excavation, the excavator shall inform the damage prevention system when providing notice of the excavation.  If an excavator determines during the effective term of the excavator's notification that blasting is required within the area premarked in accordance with paragraph IV, the excavator shall notify the damage prevention system of the need to blast.  Notification shall be made at least 24 hours prior to any blasting, not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.  In the case of unanticipated obstructions that prevent further excavation without blasting, the excavator shall provide separate notice of such blasting not less than 4 contiguous hours in advance of such blasting, not including the hours of 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. weekdays, or all of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.

<center><h3>Section 374:59</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374:59 Telephone Number Conservation and Area Code Implementation Policy Principles. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Commission'' means the public utilities commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Geographic split'' means the division of an area code into typically 2 areas each served by its own area code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Overlay'' means the addition of a new area code serving the same geographic area as the existing area code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission should promote and adopt telephone number conservation measures to the maximum extent allowed by federal law for area code 603 and any subsequently assigned New Hampshire area codes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission should adopt measures, to the maximum extent allowable by federal law and availability of technology, to provide that all customers of all suppliers have equitable access to all currently available unassigned telephone numbers and equitable access to numbers that have not been assigned to a customer which are available for porting to a second supplier.  Blocks of telephone numbers that are currently assigned but may be retrievable if thousands number block pooling becomes available should be assigned on an equitable basis to all suppliers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission should adopt measures, to the maximum extent allowable by federal law and availability of technology, to provide for local number portability by all suppliers of local exchange service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. To the extent that any one competitor is responsible for managing a pool of numbers which is to be assigned to customers of that competitor and other competitors, the commission should adopt policies to require that the assignment and management of the numbers be kept segregated from the marketing portion of that competitor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When determining whether to implement a new area code via geographic split or overlay the commission should consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria when determining the public interest:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Which method best minimizes customer disruption from having to change numbers;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Which method is the least costly for business and residents;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Which method best minimizes customer confusion;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Which method is the least costly for providers to implement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Which method most effectively conserves the total pool of telephone numbers once a new area code is created;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Which method minimizes geographic controversy;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Which method is most equitable to every resident and business in New Hampshire;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Which method minimizes repeating the disruption of area code changes in the future;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Which method best ensures public safety;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Which method is more competitively neutral;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Which method utilizes best available technology and comprehensive telecommunications planning.
