<center><h3>Section 374-G:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-G:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Distributed energy resources can increase overall energy efficiency and provide energy security and diversity by eliminating, displacing, or better managing traditional fossil fuel energy deliveries from the centralized bulk power grid, in keeping with the objectives of RSA 362-F:1.  It is therefore in the public interest to stimulate investment in distributed energy resources in New Hampshire in diverse ways, including by encouraging New Hampshire electric public utilities to invest in renewable and clean distributed energy resources at the lowest reasonable cost to taxpayers benefiting the transmission and distribution system under state regulatory oversight.

<center><h3>Section 374-G:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-G:3 Electric Generation Equipment Funded by Public Utility;  Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any electric generation equipment funded in part by a public utility under this chapter is subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The energy produced by electric generation equipment owned by the public utility shall be used as an offset to distribution system losses or the public utility company's own use;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The energy produced by electric generation equipment utilizing a non-renewable fuel source that is owned by a customer, or sited on a customer's property shall be used to displace the customer's own use;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The energy produced by electric generation equipment utilizing a renewable fuel source that is owned by a customer, or sited on the consumer's premises shall be used to displace the customers own use;  however, if energy is occasionally generated in excess of the customer's energy requirements, it may be credited to the customer's account in a subsequent period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any biomass-fueled generation shall meet the emission requirements to qualify as eligible biomass technology under RSA 362-F:2, VIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any fossil-fuel fueled generation shall produce combined heat and power with a minimum energy efficiency of 60 percent, measured as usable thermal and electrical output in BTUs divided by fuel input in BTUs, shall be installed as an integrated combined heat and power application, and shall meet the following emission standards (in lbs/MW-H):  NOx--0.07;  CO--0.10;  VOCs--0.02.  A credit to meet the emission standard may be applied at the rate of one MW-H for each 3.4 million BTUs of heat recovered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. These requirements apply in addition to and do not preempt or replace any emission standards or permitting requirements applicable to a given generation facility under any other applicable state or federal law.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-G:4 Investments in Distributed Energy Resources. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, as provided in RSA 374-G:5, a New Hampshire electric public utility may invest in or own distributed energy resources, located on or inter-connected to the local electric distribution system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Distributed electric generation owned by or receiving investments from an electric utility under this section shall be limited to a cumulative maximum in megawatts of 6 percent of the utility's total distribution peak load in megawatts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition, once the cumulative generation authorized under this chapter for a given public utility reaches 3 percent of the utility's total distribution peak load in megawatts, then that utility shall not be allowed to add any additional non-renewable generation under this chapter, until the cumulative renewable generation installed pursuant to this chapter, as a percentage of total generation installed pursuant to this chapter, shall equal or exceed twice the sum of the then-applicable percentage requirements for class I and class II under RSA 362-F:3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-G:5 Rate Filing;  Authorization. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A New Hampshire electric public utility may seek rate recovery for its portion of investments in distributed energy resources from the commission by making an appropriate rate filing.  At a minimum, such filing shall include the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A detailed description and economic and environmental evaluation of the proposed investment.
<br>
