&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, as provided in RSA 374-G:5, a New Hampshire electric public utility may invest in or own distributed energy resources, located on or inter-connected to the local electric distribution system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Distributed electric generation owned by or receiving investments from an electric utility under this section shall be limited to a cumulative maximum in megawatts of 6 percent of the utility's total distribution peak load in megawatts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition, once the cumulative generation authorized under this chapter for a given public utility reaches 3 percent of the utility's total distribution peak load in megawatts, then that utility shall not be allowed to add any additional non-renewable generation under this chapter, until the cumulative renewable generation installed pursuant to this chapter, as a percentage of total generation installed pursuant to this chapter, shall equal or exceed twice the sum of the then-applicable percentage requirements for class I and class II under RSA 362-F:3.
