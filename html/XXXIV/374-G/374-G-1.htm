&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 374-G:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Distributed energy resources can increase overall energy efficiency and provide energy diversity by eliminating, displacing, or better managing energy deliveries from the centralized bulk power grid, in keeping with the objectives of RSA 362-F:1.  It is therefore in the public interest to stimulate investment in distributed energy resources in New Hampshire by encouraging New Hampshire electric public utilities to invest in distributed energy resources including clean and renewable generation benefiting the transmission and distribution system under state regulatory oversight.
