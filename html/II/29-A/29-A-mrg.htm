<center><h3>Section 29-A:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 29-A:1 Statement of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the intent of this chapter to protect county officers, trustees, officials and employees who are subject to claims and civil actions arising from acts committed within the scope of their official duty while in the course of their employment for the county.  It is not intended to create a new remedy for injured persons, nor to waive the sovereign immunity of the county which is extended by law to county officers, trustees, officials and employees.  The doctrine of sovereign immunity of the state, extended to the counties by law, and the extension of that doctrine to officers, trustees, officials or employees of the county or any agency thereof acting within the scope of official duty and not in a wanton or reckless manner, except as otherwise provided by statute, is hereby adopted as the law of the state.

In such case the county shall also protect, indemnify, and hold harmless such person from any costs, damages, awards, judgments, or settlements arising from said claim or suit.  The county commissioners or county convention shall not be required to consider the request of such person that representation be provided for the person unless within 7 days of the time such person is served with any summons, complaint, process, notice, demand, or pleading he or she shall deliver the original or a copy thereof to the county commissioners or, in the case of an action against the county commissioners, to the clerk of the county convention.  No property either real or personal of any county shall be subject to attachment or execution to secure payment of or to satisfy any obligations of the county created under this chapter.  Upon entry of final judgment in any action brought under this chapter the county commissioners shall present such judgment to the county convention for the requisite appropriation.  The county attorney or outside counsel retained under this chapter shall have the authority, with the concurrence of the county commissioners, to settle any claim brought under this chapter by compromise;  and the county commissioners shall present said settlement to the county convention for the requisite appropriation.
