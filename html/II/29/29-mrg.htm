<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The county treasurer shall have custody of all moneys belonging to the county, and shall pay out the same only upon orders of the commissioners.  The county treasurer shall deposit the same in participation units in the public deposit investment pool established pursuant to RSA 383:22, or in federally insured banks chartered under the laws of New Hampshire or the federal government with a branch within the state, except that funds may be deposited in federally insured banks outside the state if such banks pledge and deliver to a third party custodial bank or the regional federal reserve bank collateral security for such deposits of the following types:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) United States government obligations,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) United States government agency obligations;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Obligations of the state of New Hampshire in value at least equal to the amount of the deposit in each case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amount of collected funds on deposit in any one bank shall not at any time exceed the sum of its paid-up capital and surplus.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The county treasurer shall keep in suitable books provided for the purpose a fair and correct account of all sums received into and paid from the county treasury, and of all notes given by the county, with the particulars thereof.  At the close of each fiscal year, the county treasurer shall make a report to the county, giving a particular account of all the treasurer's financial transactions during the year.  The treasurer shall furnish to the commissioners statements from the books, and submit the books and vouchers to them and to the county auditors for examination, whenever so requested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Whenever the county treasurer has in custody an excess of funds which are not immediately needed for the purpose of expenditure, the treasurer shall, with the approval of the commissioners, invest the same in obligations of the United States government, in participation units in the public deposit investment pool established pursuant to RSA 383:22, or in deposits, including money market accounts, or certificates of deposit, or repurchase agreements, and all other types of interest bearing accounts, of federally insured banks chartered under the laws of the state of New Hampshire or the federal government with a branch within the state.  Any person who directly or indirectly receives any such funds or moneys for deposit or for investment in securities of any kind shall, prior to acceptance of such funds, make available at the time of such deposit or investment, an option to have such funds secured by collateral having a value at least equal to the amount of such funds.  Such collateral shall be segregated for the exclusive benefit of the county.  Only securities defined by the bank commissioner in rules adopted pursuant to RSA 386:57 shall be eligible to be pledged as collateral.  At least yearly, the county treasurer, with the approval of the county commissioners, shall review and adopt an investment policy for the investment of public funds in conformance with the provisions of applicable statutes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. As an alternative to the option of collateralization for excess funds provided in paragraph IV, the county treasurer may also invest public funds in certificates of deposit which meet all of the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The funds are initially invested through a federally insured bank chartered under the laws of New Hampshire or the federal government with a branch within the state, selected by the treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The selected bank arranges for the deposit of the funds in certificates of deposit in one or more federally insured financial institutions located in the United States, for the account of the treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The full amount of principal and any accrued interest of each such certificate of deposit is covered by federal deposit insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The selected bank acts as custodian with respect to such certificates of deposit issued for the account of the treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) At the same time that the funds are deposited and the certificates of deposit are issued, the selected bank receives an amount of deposits from customers of other federally insured financial institutions equal to or greater than the amount of the funds initially invested through the selected bank by the treasurer.

Whenever the county treasurer has in custody an excess of funds which are not immediately needed for the purpose of expenditure the county treasurer may, with the approval of the county commissioners and county executive committee and upon such terms as shall be approved by the county commissioners, invest the same in participation units in the public deposit investment pool established pursuant to RSA 383:22, or in units of pooled money market mutual funds which invest solely in obligations of the United States Treasury, or in obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States government.  The obligations may be held directly or in the form of securities of or other interests in any open-end or closed-end management-type investment company or investment trust registered under 15 U. S.C. section 80a-1 et seq., if the portfolio of the investment company or investment trust is limited to such obligations and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such obligations.  Any person who directly or indirectly receives any such funds or moneys for deposit or for investment in securities of any kind shall, prior to acceptance of such funds, make available at the time of such deposit or investment, an option to have such funds secured by collateral having a value at least equal to the amount of such funds.
