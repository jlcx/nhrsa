II. The charter commission shall meet within 30 days of its appointment at a meeting called by the chairman of the board of commissioners.  At this meeting, the charter commission shall organize by electing from its members a chairman, a vice chairman, and clerk-secretary.  The commission shall also prepare a schedule for future meetings.  All meetings, hearings and deliberations of the charter commission shall be subject to RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Vacancies occurring on the commission shall be filled promptly by the nominating committee using the same rules for selection as in RSA 28-A:2.  Members shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for expenses lawfully incurred by them in the performance of their duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The charter commission shall adopt rules governing the conduct of its meetings and proceedings in accordance with an accepted parliamentary procedure, shall keep appropriate records, and may employ such legal, research, clerical, or other employees and consultants as are deemed necessary within the limits of its budget.
