<codesect>
A sentencing court may order that any person sentenced to imprisonment in a county department of corrections facility may be released therefrom by the superintendent with the approval of the sentencing court at the time of sentence, or at any time during the term of sentence based on the rules and regulations of the county correctional facility for such purposes as the superintendent may deem conducive to his or her rehabilitation.  Such release shall be for such terms or intervals of time and under such terms and conditions as may be permitted by the facility's rules and regulations or as the court may order.  Any part of a day spent in the free community under such a release order shall be counted as a full day toward the serving of the sentence unless otherwise provided by the sentencing court.
