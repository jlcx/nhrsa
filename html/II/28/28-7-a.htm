<codesect>
For each unincorporated town or unorganized place, the county in which it is located and its commissioners shall have the same responsibilities for providing services as a town and its governing body.  County conventions may at any legal meeting grant and vote such sums of money as they judge necessary for any purpose for which the county may act, if such appropriation is not prohibited by the laws or by the constitution of this state.  The cost of providing services for a county's unincorporated towns and unorganized places shall be assessed on the property taxpayers of the unincorporated towns or unorganized places under RSA 81.
