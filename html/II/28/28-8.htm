&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 28:8 Competitive Bidding on Purchases. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any purchase of equipment or materials made by a county in an amount exceeding $5,000 shall be by competitive bidding, provided that the county commissioners by unanimous vote may waive the provisions for such bidding.  In case the commissioners so vote a copy of such action shall be recorded in their offices with a statement of the reason therefor and such record shall be open to public inspection.  Orders for equipment or material to be delivered at different times where the single delivery may be less than $5,000 but the total order exceeds that amount shall be construed as coming within the provisions hereof requiring competitive bidding.
