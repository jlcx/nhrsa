<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All purchases made by Hillsborough county for materials, equipment, supplies, services, insurance, building repairs or any other item, in an amount exceeding $5,000 shall be by competitive bidding.  Awards for such purchases shall be made to the lowest responsible bidder.  Orders for purchases to be delivered at different times where the single delivery may be less than $5,000, but the total order exceeds that amount shall be construed as coming within the provisions of this section requiring competitive bidding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining "lowest responsible bidder'', in addition to price, the following shall be considered:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or service;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular use required;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the cost of the service is fixed by law, competitive bidding shall not be required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the proposed purchase is manufactured by only one company, or if it is deemed advisable to make a purchase from a specific company to reduce costs of maintaining additional parts, the county commissioners, at the request of the department concerned, are authorized to waive competitive bidding procedures, subject to review of this decision by the executive committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Competitive bidding by a department shall not be required if items can be procured through the state of New Hampshire, department of administrative services, division of procurement and support services either by direct purchase or from the state supplier at the state price, provided the department files a full report with the county commissioners and with the executive committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Competitive bidding shall not be required where a department is able to negotiate prices for items of purchase that are lower than bid prices for the same material in the same transportation zone, provided the department files a full report with the county commissioners and with the executive committee substantiating the fact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Competitive bidding shall be interpreted to include guaranteed annual cost purchasing whenever applicable whenever this factor is considered to be of value in obtaining the lowest possible annual cost for the department, insofar as this is in agreement with the line item budget appropriation established in the county budget.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In case of an emergency which requires immediate purchase of supplies or contractual services, the department concerned is authorized to secure by open market procedure, at the lowest obtainable price, any supplies or contractual services regardless of the amount of the expenditure.  A full report of the circumstances of the emergency purchase shall be filed with the county commissioners and with the executive committee and shall be open to public inspection.

Each county employee shall receive a copy of the rules and procedures which the county adopts.  Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to limit negotiations under, or the applicability of, RSA 273-A.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any employee of a county institution who has served at least one year shall not be discharged, removed, or suspended from employment except for dishonesty, intoxication, immoral behavior or other misconduct, neglect of duty, negligence, willful insubordination, lack of cooperation, inefficiency, incapacity or unfitness to perform his duties, or for the good of the institution to which he is assigned, and subject to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Prior to the discharge or removal of any such employee, a statement of the grounds and reasons for the discharge or removal shall be prepared by the county commissioners and signed by a majority of the county commissioners.

III. Within 30 days of receipt of the notice under subparagraph II(a), or within 10 days of the first day of suspension under subparagraph II(b), the employee may request in writing a public hearing on such notice or suspension before the county personnel committee, consisting of the chairman, vice-chairman and clerk of the county convention, except if said employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement under RSA 273-A, in which case the employee's hearing and discharge, removal, or suspension proceedings shall be held pursuant to the provisions of the agreement.  If, upon such hearing, said committee finds good cause for discharge, removal, or suspension of the employee, they shall approve his discharge, removal, or suspension as ordered or approved by the county commissioners.  The personnel committee may establish reasonable rules for procedure and the admission of evidence and shall keep a record of all proceedings under this section.  Any action or decision made under this section shall be subject to rehearing and appeal as provided in RSA 541.  The county personnel committee, when acting under the provisions of this section, shall be deemed a commission within the meaning of RSA 541:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The salary of said employee shall terminate or be suspended on the effective date of his discharge, removal, or suspension;  provided, however, that if the employee has been discharged, removed, or suspended without good cause, he shall be reinstated to his former position without loss of pay for the period of suspension and shall be reimbursed for his legal costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as determined by the personnel committee or, in the event of appeal from its ruling, by the supreme court.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 28:10-c Employee Candidate Background Checks. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The county commissioners may require a background investigation and a criminal history records check on any candidate for employment, prior to a final offer of employment.  A county may request only a state records check or both a federal and state records check, to be conducted through the division of state police.  The county may extend a conditional offer of employment to a candidate, with a final offer of employment subject to a successfully completed criminal history records check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A candidate for employment in a position that the county commissioners determine requires a background investigation and a criminal history records check shall submit to the county a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The candidate shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a law enforcement agency as directed by the county commissioners.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern and a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check, the conditional offer of employment shall remain in effect.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the county may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where a candidate has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To obtain a state records check only, the county shall submit a state criminal history records release form to the division of state police.  To obtain both the federal and the state records check, the county shall submit the criminal history records release form and applicant fingerprint card to the division of state police, which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall report any criminal conviction information to the county commissioners.  The county may submit fingerprint information electronically, in accordance with procedures established by the division of state police.  The county shall maintain the confidentiality and security of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The county commissioners may require the candidate to pay the actual costs of the background investigation and the criminal history records check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In this section, "candidate for employment'' shall include candidates for volunteer positions in the county.
