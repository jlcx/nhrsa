I. In order to protect and develop the state's forest resources, provide for the safety of woodlands from fire in relation to primary wood processing mills, and to respond to forest health threats, such mills and wood concentration yards shall be registered by the director.  Primary wood processing mills shall provide the director with information on the locations, owner, type of mill, operating capacity, species, volumes, and state of origin of wood harvested and timber processed, purchased, and sold, and the output of wood and timber products.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) No person shall operate or cause to be operated any mill processing primary forest products or wood concentration yard unless said mill or wood concentration yard shall be registered by the director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) There shall be an annual mill registration fee of $20 for all mills processing primary forest products or wood concentration yards, regardless of size, type of mill or wood concentration yard, or primary product being processed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Application for registration shall be made on forms provided by the director, giving the name of owner or owners, and locations of a primary wood processing mill or a wood concentration yard.  Primary wood processing mills shall provide the director with information on the products produced, type, capacity, and such other pertinent information as the director may require.  One application shall cover a mill complex in a given location involving more than one unit of equipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The director shall issue to the applicant a permanent registration number assigned to the mill or wood concentration yard described in the application together with a sign or plate denoting such registration number, to be displayed in a conspicuous place at the mill or wood concentration yard.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The director, or duly authorized agent, may, at any time, inspect any primary wood processing mill or wood concentration yard to assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this section or rules adopted under RSA 541-A shall, for the first 30-day period, be guilty of a violation if a natural person, or guilty of a misdemeanor if any other person.
