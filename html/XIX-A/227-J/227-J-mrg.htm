&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-J:1 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby recognized and declared that the public welfare of this state requires the care and protection of forest cover adjacent to certain waters of the state and along public highways, and the proper disposal of slash and mill residue resulting from forest operations in certain circumstances to help conserve the amount and quality of surface waters and groundwaters of the state;  reduce the incidence and severity of forest fires;  promote healthful surroundings, recreational opportunities, and scenic values;  ensure future forest productivity;  improve conditions for wildlife;  and provide other benefits to the public as the result of perpetuating a proper forest cover, while continuing to meet the timber needs of forest industries and providing income and employment for our citizens without undue infringement on the rights of private forest landowners.
