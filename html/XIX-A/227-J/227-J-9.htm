<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Within 150 feet of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any great pond;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any standing body of water 10 acres or more in area;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any fourth order or higher stream;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Any public highway;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 50 feet of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any standing body of water less than 10 acres in area associated with a stream, river, or brook which normally flows throughout the year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This paragraph shall not apply if the person who pushes over, cuts, saws, or operates upon, or causes to be pushed, cut, sawed, or operated upon, any trees described in subparagraphs (a) or (b), obtains the prior written consent of the director, or of the director's agents in accordance with paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Timber cutting for land conversion purposes, other than timber growing and forest uses, shall be exempt from this section if those persons intending to convert the use of the land have secured all required local permits including, but not limited to, building, subdivision or zoning permits, excavation permits, or site plan approval necessary for the use to which the land will be converted, and are able to furnish proof of such permits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No person shall clear land of natural vegetation on a given lot, tract, or parcel proposed for subdivision pursuant to RSA 485-A:32, unless such subdivision plan has been submitted and approved in accordance with the requirements of RSA 485-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Timber cutting for land conversion purposes, other than timber growing and forest uses, that does not require any local permits shall be exempt from this section if conversion occurs within 180 days of exceeding the provisions in paragraph I, or there has been prior written consent to extend the 180-day period from the director or the director's agents in accordance with paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Before the director grants a request to exceed the limits established in this section, the landowner or authorized agent shall demonstrate that it is necessary to exceed such limits and that any and all actions are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.  The director shall provide a standard request form for this purpose.  This form shall be submitted to the director or the director's agents at least 30 days prior to commencing the timber cutting operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Failure of the division to act upon the request within 30 days shall serve as automatic approval.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Each 200 linear feet or fraction thereof of frontage on the affected great pond, any standing body of water 10 acres or more in area, fourth order stream or higher, or public highway, or any other stream, river or brook which normally flows throughout the year or standing body of water less than 10 acres in size associated with a stream, river or brook which normally flows throughout the year, from which trees are cut in excess of limits prescribed in this section shall constitute a separate offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. This section shall be enforceable by the municipality in which the land is situated;  provided, however, that before initiating any enforcement action, the municipality shall notify the director, who shall take action to the extent the director deems necessary to ensure uniform statewide enforcement.  If, within 10 days of notification to the director, no enforcement action has been taken by the director or the director's agent, the municipality may proceed with actions necessary to ensure compliance with the law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Forest management not associated with shoreland development nor land conversion and conducted in compliance with the provisions of this section shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 483-B.
