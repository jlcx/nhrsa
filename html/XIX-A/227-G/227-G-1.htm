<codesect>
It is hereby recognized and declared that the public welfare of this state requires the maintenance, protection, conservation, multiple use, and rehabilitation of forests for the social, economic, and environmental benefits that result from a diverse forest cover.  Such benefits include forest products, a viable forest-based economy, recreation opportunities, scenic values, healthful surroundings, climate mitigation, clean water, and biologically diverse populations of plants and animals.  It is further recognized that long-term sustainability of the state's forests will require:  the prudent acquisition and management of state-owned forests;  data collection, planning, and education;  protection of critical resources;  monitoring and protection of forest health;  and control of woodland fires.
