&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-M:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that in order to maintain New Hampshire's quality of life and economic vitality for its citizens, growth and development should be balanced with careful protection of the state's most important natural, cultural, and historical resources.  Permanent protection of these resources, through acquisition of lands, buildings, and other physical assets, or interests in these assets, must be accomplished along with their planned long-term stewardship.  The general court further recognizes the importance of public-private partnerships to achieve these ends.  To protect and preserve New Hampshire's natural, cultural, and historical resources for this and future generations, the general court establishes in this chapter the New Hampshire land and community heritage investment program.  The intent of the program is to conserve and preserve this state's most important natural, cultural, and historical resources through the acquisition of lands, and cultural and historical resources, or interests therein, of local, regional, and statewide significance, in partnership with the state's municipalities and the private sector, for the primary purposes of protecting and ensuring the perpetual contribution of these resources to the state's economy, environment, and overall quality of life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-M:13 Road Expansion. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the New Hampshire land and community heritage authority shall recognize that the public interest and public safety and welfare may, from time to time, require minor expansion, minor modification, or minor alteration of existing roads within the state highway system.  After review and approval by the authority, and notwithstanding RSA 227-M:14, the department of transportation may obtain interests in lands acquired by the authority under this chapter adjacent to state highways.  Permissible expansion, modifications, or alterations under this section shall include drainage easements, slope easements, lane widening, the addition of a passing, climbing, or turning lane, or similar adjustments, but shall not include construction of a new highway or portion thereof, construction of a bypass for an existing highway, or similar major alterations.  Approval shall not be granted if reasonable and prudent alternatives exist nor if individual or cumulative approvals are likely to materially impair the conservation or preservation purposes for which the parcel was originally protected.  Projects determined by the authority to be outside of the scope permitted by this chapter shall require approval from the general court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of transportation shall submit a written request to the authority with plans and supporting documentation to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  The authority shall hold a public hearing within 90 days of receipt of a complete request to release land and community heritage investment program interests.  The authority shall provide at least 10 calendar days notice in advance of such hearing.  Notification shall be made, at the expense of the department, to the landowner, local governing body and conservation commission, abutters, the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, the Nature Conservancy, the Audubon Society of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation, the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance, the local historic district commission or the local heritage commission, or both, and the county conservation district, or their successors.  Notification of the public hearing shall be published, by the department, in a paper of general circulation in the municipality and shall be posted, by the department, in at least 2 public places.  At the hearing or within 15 days after the hearing, a majority of the authority's voting members shall vote to approve or deny the application, unless a time extension is requested by the department.  Aggrieved parties, which include all parties who must be notified under this paragraph, may appeal the authority's decision to the superior court in the same manner as planning board decisions are appealed under RSA 677:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Compensation for any interest in land obtained by the department of transportation under this section shall be at the appraised full fair market value of those property interests at the time of the department's acquisition.  Alternative forms of compensation such as replacement land with comparable conservation value, or a combination of monetary compensation and replacement land may be considered in appropriate circumstances, provided all parties owning an interest in the property agree to such terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Compensation due to municipalities and nonprofit organizations shall be dedicated to the acquisition, managing, or monitoring of protected lands consistent with the purposes of this chapter.  Compensation due landowners shall be as specified in the deed or as otherwise negotiated.  Any party aggrieved by the amount of compensation may file a petition with the superior court in the same manner as damage appeals are filed from the board of tax and land appeals under RSA 498-A:27.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-M:15 Public Access;  Liability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Lands and interests in lands purchased with funds from this program by any eligible applicant shall be open in perpetuity for passive recreational purposes or shall be for the term of any farm viability term easement.  Language to be used in easement interests secured through the program shall approximate the intent of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby conveyed pedestrian access to, on, and across the property for hunting, fishing, and transitory passive recreational purposes, but not camping, by members of the public.  A grantor may reserve the right to post against vehicles, motorized or otherwise and against access to active livestock fields, against access to agricultural cropland during planting and growing season, and against access to forest land during harvesting or establishment of plantations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority shall have the discretion to limit or prohibit passive recreational use on a case-by-case basis, where this activity would be inconsistent with the purpose for protecting the property and/or when public safety would be at risk.  Additionally, the authority may stipulate, as a condition of funding, on a case-by-case basis where appropriate, that certain lands or interests in lands be available for motorized recreational uses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No person, or successor in title, who has granted or sold rights of public access by virtue of an easement, right-of-way, development right, or other means in accordance with the purposes of this chapter shall be liable to a user of that right of access for injuries suffered on that portion of the access unless those injuries are caused by the willful or wanton misconduct of the grantor or successor in title.
