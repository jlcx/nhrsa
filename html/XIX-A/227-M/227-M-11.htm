<codesect>
All applications submitted for funding resource asset acquisitions or restoration or rehabilitation projects must contain a stewardship plan.  Applicants shall be allowed flexibility in devising such plans, but the authority shall make an affirmative finding that the stewardship plan is acceptable before awarding funds.  Applications to the program for activities such as resource inventories and engineering studies are not required to include stewardship plans.
