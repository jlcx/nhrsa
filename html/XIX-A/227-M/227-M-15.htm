Lands and interests in lands purchased with funds from this program by any eligible applicant shall be open in perpetuity for passive recreational purposes or shall be for the term of any farm viability term easement.  Language to be used in easement interests secured through the program shall approximate the intent of the following:

I. There is hereby conveyed pedestrian access to, on, and across the property for hunting, fishing, and transitory passive recreational purposes, but not camping, by members of the public.  A grantor may reserve the right to post against vehicles, motorized or otherwise and against access to active livestock fields, against access to agricultural cropland during planting and growing season, and against access to forest land during harvesting or establishment of plantations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority shall have the discretion to limit or prohibit passive recreational use on a case-by-case basis, where this activity would be inconsistent with the purpose for protecting the property and/or when public safety would be at risk.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
