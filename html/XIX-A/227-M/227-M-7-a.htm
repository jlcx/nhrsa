&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established in the office of the New Hampshire land and community heritage investment authority a fund to be known as the land and community heritage investment program administrative fund into which the commissioner of safety shall credit any revenue generated pursuant to RSA 261:97-b, I-a.  There shall also be deposited, on a monthly basis, interest income generated on appropriations made to the land and community heritage investment program trust fund pursuant to RSA 227-M:7.  The total revenues generated to the administrative fund from these 2 sources shall not exceed $335,000 for each fiscal year.  Any revenue generated from these 2 sources in excess of the $335,000 maximum per year shall be credited by the New Hampshire land and community heritage investment authority to the land and community heritage investment program trust fund in RSA 227-M:7.  The authority shall include in its annual report the amount of revenues exceeding the maximum which are credited to the trust fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All sums so credited shall be appropriated to the authority for the following purposes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To pay the costs of administering and operating the authority, including, but not limited to, all wages, salaries, benefits, and other expenses authorized by the board or the executive director.  The authority may enter into a contract or agreement for provision of services to withhold on a monthly basis all payroll and benefit costs for employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In general for the payment of all expenses incident to the management and operation of the authority as are consistent with its statutory purpose and as the board or the executive director thereof may from time to time determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This fund shall constitute a continuing appropriation for the benefit of the authority.  Any amount remaining to the credit of the authority at the close of any fiscal year, and any interest accrued, shall be nonlapsing and shall be carried over and credited to the fund for the succeeding year.
