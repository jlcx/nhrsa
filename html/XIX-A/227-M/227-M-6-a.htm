<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The authority may hire, fix, and pay compensation, prescribe duties and qualifications, and establish personnel policies without regard to any personnel or civil service law or personnel or civil service rule of the state.  The employees of the authority shall not be classified employees of the state within the meaning of RSA 21-I:49.  Any individual employed by the authority shall be deemed an employee at will and shall serve at the pleasure of the authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, any individual employed by the authority whose employment calls for 30 hours or more work in a normal calendar week, and whose position is anticipated to have a duration of 6 months or more, shall be entitled to elect to receive such health, dental, life insurance, deferred compensation, and retirement benefits as are afforded to classified employees of the state provided, however, that the election is made in writing within 30 days of the start of employment.  Upon election by such individual, the authority shall pay from its revenues the state's share of such benefits.  Any remaining costs of health, dental, life insurance, deferred compensation, and retirement benefits which an individual elects to receive pursuant to this section, shall be withheld from such individual's salary as a payroll deduction.  Written notice of the availability of these benefit options shall be provided to each individual upon employment by the authority.
