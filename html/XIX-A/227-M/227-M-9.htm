(d) Extent to which project meets multiple objectives of the program (natural, historic, and cultural);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Strength of local support, such that project applications accompanied by an affirmative vote of the governing body of the municipality or governing bodies of the municipalities in which the project is located shall receive a higher ranking;
