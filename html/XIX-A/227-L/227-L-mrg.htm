&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-L:22 Municipal Fire Control Payments;  Apportionment of Expenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The expenses of presuppression and suppression of woodland fires in municipalities, and other expenses lawfully incurred by wardens and deputy wardens of municipalities in preventing woodland fires, shall be borne equally by the municipality and the state, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and except that when in any one municipal fiscal year the net total of sums required for the presuppression, suppression, and prevention of woodland fires, excluding the initial cost of firefighting equipment, to be so borne by such municipality, computed at rates within limits established by the commissioner and the director, shall equal  1/4 of one percent of the latest equalized locally assessed valuation on such municipality, expenses incurred in excess of such sum shall be borne entirely by the state on the basis of the rate limits specified in this paragraph.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to expenses incurred in fighting any woodland fire when, as determined by the commissioner, such fire was caused either by the negligence of the town or of its agents;  or in cases in which there is negligence on the part of the town or its agents in collecting expenses from violators under RSA 227-L:17, V.  Any determination of the commissioner under the provisions of the preceding sentence shall be subject to rehearing and appeal as provided in RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The warden shall render to the selectmen or the mayor or the authorized city department, on blanks prepared by the director, a statement of the expenses under paragraph I, incurred by the municipality, or aiding municipality which had responded upon request, as soon as possible after they are incurred, showing in detail the amount and character of the services performed, including the costs of services rendered by volunteers, the exact duration of the service, and all disbursements made by the warden or wardens, and bearing the approval of the warden, and of the deputy warden if the expenses were incurred by the warden's authority.

III. Upon receipt of the statement, the selectmen of towns and mayors of cities, if the bill is approved, shall draw an order upon the treasurer for payment to each person employed of the amount of compensation due or to the warden for the total amount of the bill as approved, as the selectmen or mayor may determine.  If payment is made to the warden, the warden shall forthwith pay to each person employed the amount of compensation due.  The account of the warden shall be audited and included in the town report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Bills incurred in rendering aid to another town after having been paid in the first instance as prescribed in paragraph III shall, within 30 days of the date the aid was rendered, be presented for reimbursement to the town receiving the aid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A duplicate bill, showing that the bill has been audited and paid by the municipality, shall be filed by the selectmen or the mayor with the director within 60 days of the date in which the expenses were incurred.  If the director finds the expenses to be reasonable, the director shall forward the bill to the state treasurer as approved, and the governor shall draw a warrant on the state treasury in favor of the municipality for the portion of the bill for which the state is liable in accordance with the provisions of this section from any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.  The state, however, shall not reimburse municipalities or unorganized places at a rate in excess of that established from time to time by the commissioner and the director, nor shall the state be responsible for reimbursement to municipalities for such bills upon failure to render the bills within 60 days of the date expenses were incurred.

<codesect>
<center>
<p>
Article I.
</p>
</center>
The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the northeastern region of the United States and adjacent areas in Canada by the development of integrated forest fire plans, by the maintenance of adequate forest fire fighting services by the member states, by providing for mutual aid in fighting forest fires among the states of the region and for procedures that will facilitate such aid, and by the establishment of a central agency to coordinate the services of member states and perform such common services as member states may deem desirable.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This agreement shall become operative immediately as to those states ratifying it whenever any 2 or more of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have ratified it and the Congress has given its consent.  Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact.  Subject to the consent of the Congress of the United States, any province of the Dominion of Canada which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact by taking such action as its laws and the laws of the Dominion of Canada may prescribe for ratification.

</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
It shall be the duty of the commission to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances, and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the prevention and control of forest fires in the area comprising the member states, to coordinate the forest fire plans and the work of the appropriate agencies of the member states and to facilitate the rendering of aid by the member states to each other in fighting forest fires.  The commission shall formulate and, in accordance with need, from time to time, revise a regional forest fire plan for the entire region covered by the compact which shall serve as a common forest fire plan for that area.  The commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislature in any signatory state, present to the governor and to the legislature of the state its recommendations relating to enactments to be made by the legislature of that state in furthering the interests and purposes of this compact.

Any 2 or more member states may designate the Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Commission as a joint agency to maintain such common services as those states deem desirable for the prevention and control of forest fires.  Except in those cases where all member states join in such designation for common services, the representatives of any group of such designating states in the Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Commission shall constitute a separate section of such commission for the performance of the common service or services so designated, provided that, if any additional expense is involved, the states so acting shall appropriate the necessary funds for this purpose.  The creation of such a section as a joint agency shall not affect the privileges, powers, responsibilities, or duties of the states participating therein as embodied in the other articles of this compact.

No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.  All liability that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.  Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries, and maintenance of employees and equipment incurred in connection with such request.

For the purposes of this compact the term employee shall include any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest firefighting forces of the aiding state under the laws thereof.  The commission shall formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article.
