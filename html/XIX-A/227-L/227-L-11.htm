&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-L:11 Duties of Forest Fire Wardens and Deputy Wardens. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Wardens and deputy wardens, or some agent or agents designated by them, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) When directed by the director, patrol the woods in their respective cities, towns or places, warning persons who traverse the woods, campers, hunters, fishermen, and others about lighting and extinguishing fires.  They shall post extracts from the fire laws and other notices sent them by the director along the highways, streams, and waters frequented by tourists and others, at campsites and in other public places.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Extinguish all woodland fires occurring in their town, or elsewhere when so directed by the director or the director's authorized agent.  Either of them may call such assistance as the person deems necessary to aid in extinguishing the fires, may require the use of vehicles or other equipment and property for that purpose, and may order any road or highway closed to any motor vehicle if it becomes necessary in order to safeguard the proper extinguishing of such fire.  Such authority shall not interfere with the authority of chiefs of city fire departments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Make reports to the forest ranger of the district in which they are located or to the director of the division, at such time and in such form as the director may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Forest fire wardens and deputy wardens or any agent designated by them may, with the approval of the director, brush-out and make passable old roads and trails useful for the passage of personnel and equipment in case of woodland fires.  Expenditures for this purpose shall be shared by the state and town, place or municipality in the same proportion as other prevention expense, except that the state's share under this section shall not exceed $25 to any one town, place, or municipality in any year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If any warden or deputy warden shall willfully neglect or refuse to perform the duties prescribed in this subdivision, the warden or deputy warden shall, upon complaint of the director, be guilty of a misdemeanor.
