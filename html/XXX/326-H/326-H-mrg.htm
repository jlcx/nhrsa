&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 326-H:2 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court recognizes that dietitians play an important role in treating illness, injury, and other medical conditions;  and in improving the quality of life of seriously ill patients;  all of which can result in cost savings to the health care system.  The general court finds and declares that the practices of dietitians in the state of New Hampshire affect public health, safety, and welfare;  these practices make important and distinct contributions to patient care, and it is in the public's best interest to have qualified individuals who practice in this profession.  In doing so, the general court recognizes that there are many aspects of nutrition and it is not the purpose of this act to restrict the ability of any person to provide advice, counseling, or assessments in matters of food, diet, or nutrition and to receive compensation for such services, thereby assuring that all persons can obtain nutrition and dietary information, dietary counseling, and information regarding food, food products, dietary supplements, and their proper use, from any source of that person's choosing.  The purpose of this act, therefore, is to establish regulations and standards of qualification, training, and experience for individuals who are practicing dietitians.
