I. Reflexologists practice the use of alternating pressure applied to the reflexes within the reflex maps of the body located on the feet, hands, and outer ears.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Structural integrators restore postural balance and functional ease by systematically aligning and integrating the human body in gravity.  Structural integrators work through manipulation of the connective tissue matrix, enhancement of the client's awareness, and education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Asian bodywork therapists treat the human body, mind, emotions, spirit, and energy field using traditional Asian techniques and treatment strategies for the purpose of promoting, maintaining, and restoring health.  Asian bodywork therapists use methods of assessment and treatment based on the principles of Chinese medicine.  Treatment may include, but is not limited to touching, pressing or holding the body along meridians and/or acupoints, application of heat or cold, stretching, external application of herbal or other topical preparations not classified as prescription drugs, and dietary or exercise suggestions.
