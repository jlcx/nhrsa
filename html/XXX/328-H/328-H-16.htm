The practice of reflexology, structural integration, or Asian bodywork therapy by a person without a license issued under this chapter or whose license has been suspended or revoked or has expired is declared to be a danger to the public health and welfare.  In addition to any other civil, criminal, or disciplinary remedy, the attorney general, the executive director, or the prosecuting attorney of any county or municipality where the person is practicing or purporting to practice, in accordance with the laws of this state, may maintain an action to enjoin that person from practicing until such person secures a valid license.
