<codesect>
The general court, to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state of New Hampshire, establishes a regulatory program for licensure of reflexologists, structural integrators, and Asian bodywork therapists.  The general court recognizes that there are different and specific bodywork professions, and this chapter provides for licensure to differentiate those professions that have attained maturity through established history and the creation of credible professional associations and training.
