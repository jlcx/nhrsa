&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329:17-c Denial or Revocation of License. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon receipt of an administratively final order from the licensing authority of another jurisdiction which imposes disciplinary sanctions against a licensee of the board, or a person applying for such license, the board may issue an order directing the licensee or applicant to appear and show cause why similar disciplinary sanctions or, in the case of an applicant, license denial or restriction, should not be imposed in the state.  In any such proceeding, the decision of the foreign licensing authority may not be collaterally attacked, but the licensee or applicant shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate why a lesser sanction should be imposed.  The board may issue any disciplinary sanction or take any action with regard to a license application pursuant to this section otherwise permitted by this chapter, including sanctions or actions which are more stringent then those imposed by the foreign jurisdiction.  The board may adopt summary procedures for handling proceedings brought under this chapter, but shall furnish the respondent at least 10 days' written notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.  The board may require a licensee to suspend practice in this state as a condition of postponing a hearing date established for allegations brought under this section.
