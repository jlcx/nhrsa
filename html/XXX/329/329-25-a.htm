Any person who has retired from the practice of medicine and who has notified the board of such person's intention to participate in a program for the education of the public in matters involving the practice of medicine may hold himself or herself out as being retired from the active practice of medicine by adding the designation "Ret,'' or "Retired'' after the reference to such person's medical degrees.  Any such retired physician shall be immune from civil liability for providing education in good faith, without compensation in public forums or in response to individual inquiries from members of the public.
