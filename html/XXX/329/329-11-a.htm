&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every applicant for initial permanent licensure or reinstatement shall submit to the board of medicine a notarized criminal history record release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of his or her criminal history record, if any, to the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The applicant shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the department of safety.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints shall be necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the board may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board shall submit the criminal history records release form and fingerprint form to the division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the records check, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal history records to the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board shall review the criminal record information prior to making a licensing decision and shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records received pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The applicant shall bear the cost of a criminal history record check.
