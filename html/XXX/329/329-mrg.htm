&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329:1-aa Purpose of Chapter. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The practice of medicine is a privilege granted by the people according to the laws enacted by the legislature, and not a natural right.  In the interests of public health, safety, and welfare, and to protect the public from the unprofessional, improper, incompetent, unlawful, fraudulent, and deceptive practice of medicine, it is necessary to provide laws and rules to regulate the granting and subsequent use of the privilege to practice medicine.  The primary responsibility and obligation of the board of medicine is to protect the public.

"Physician-patient relationship'' means a medical connection between a licensed physician and a patient that includes an in-person or face-to-face 2-way real-time interactive communication exam, a history, a diagnosis, a treatment plan appropriate for the licensee's medical specialty, and documentation of all prescription drugs including name and dosage.  A licensee may prescribe for a patient whom the licensee does not have a physician-patient relationship under the following circumstances:  writing admission orders for a newly hospitalized patient;  for a patient of another licensee for whom the prescriber is taking call;  for a patient examined by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or other licensed practitioner;  or for medication on a short-term basis for a new patient prior to the patient's first appointment or when providing limited treatment to a family member in accordance with the American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics.  Prescribing drugs to individuals without a physician-patient relationship shall be unprofessional conduct subject to discipline under RSA 329:17, VI.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any peer review committee may report relevant facts to the board relating to the acts of any physician or physician assistant in this state if it has knowledge relating to the physician or physician assistant which, in the opinion of the peer review committee, might provide grounds for disciplinary action as specified in RSA 329:17.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any committee of a professional society comprised primarily of physicians, its staff, or any district or local intervenor participating in a program established to aid physicians impaired or potentially impaired by mental or physical illness including substance abuse or disruptive behavior may report in writing to the board the name of a physician whose ability to practice medicine safely is impaired or could reasonably be expected to become impaired if the condition is allowed to progress together with the pertinent information relating to the physician's impairment.  The board may report to any committee of such professional society or the society's designated staff information which it may receive with regard to any physician who may be impaired by a mental or physical illness including substance abuse or disruptive behavior.  In this chapter, "disruptive behavior'' means any abusive conduct, including sexual or other forms of harassment, or other forms of verbal or non-verbal conduct that harms or intimidates others to the extent that quality of care of patient safety could be compromised.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 91-A, the records and proceedings of the board, compiled in conjunction with a peer review committee, shall be confidential and are not to be considered open records unless the affected physician so requests;  provided, however, the board may disclose this confidential information only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In a disciplinary hearing before the board or in a subsequent trial or appeal of a board action or order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To the physician licensing or disciplinary authorities of other jurisdictions;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

IV. (a) No employee or member of the board, peer review committee member, medical organization committee member, medical organization district or local intervenor furnishing in good faith information, data, reports, or records for the purpose of aiding the impaired physician or physician assistant shall by reason of furnishing such information be liable for damages to any person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No employee or member of the board or such committee, staff, or intervenor program shall be liable for damages to any person for any action taken or recommendations made by such board, committee, or staff unless the person is found to have acted recklessly or wantonly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The board may contract with other organizations to operate the professionals' health program for physicians and physician assistants who are impaired or potentially impaired because of mental or physical illness including substance abuse or disruptive behavior.  This program shall be available to all physicians and physician assistants licensed in this state, all physicians and physician assistants seeking licensure in this state, and all resident physicians in training, and shall include, but shall not be limited to, education, intervention, ongoing care or treatment, and post-treatment monitoring.

(b) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon a determination by the board that a report submitted by a peer review committee or professional society committee is without merit, the report shall be expunged from the physician's or physicians assistant's individual record in the board's office.  A physician, or physician assistant, or authorized representative shall be entitled on request to examine the peer review or the organization committee report submitted to the board and to place into the record a statement of reasonable length of the physician's or physician assistant's view with respect to any information existing in the report.

(b) By suspension, limitation, or restriction of a license or probation for a period of time as determined reasonable by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) By revocation of license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) By requiring the person to submit to the care, treatment, or observation of a physician, counseling service, health care facility, professional assistance program, or any combination thereof which is acceptable to the board.

(e) By requiring the person to participate in a program of continuing medical education in the area or areas in which the person has been found deficient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) By requiring the person to practice under the direction of a physician in a public institution, public or private health care program, or private practice for a period of time specified by the board.

(g) By assessing administrative fines in amounts established by the board which shall not exceed $3,000 per offense, or, in the case of continuing offenses, $300 for each day that the violation continues, whichever is greater.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII-a. The board may issue a nondisciplinary confidential letter of concern to a licensee advising that while there is insufficient evidence to support disciplinary action, the board believes the physician or physician assistant should modify or eliminate certain practices, and that continuation of the activities which led to the information being submitted to the board may result in action against the licensee's license.  This letter shall not be released to the public or any other licensing authority, except that the letter may be used as evidence in subsequent disciplinary proceedings by the board, and shall be sent to a physician assistant's supervising physician.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX-a. Any persons who have had their licenses to practice medicine revoked or suspended shall be barred from practicing any other human health care activities, including psychotherapy, whether or not such other activity is licensed or certified by another licensing agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X, XI. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Allegations of professional misconduct or other violations of this chapter enforceable by the board shall be brought within 6 years from the time the board could reasonably have discovered the act, omission or failure complained of, except that conduct which resulted in a criminal conviction or in a disciplinary action by a relevant licensing authority in another jurisdiction may be considered by the board without time limitation in making licensing or disciplinary decisions if the conduct would otherwise be a ground for discipline under this chapter.  The board may also consider licensee conduct without time limitation when the ultimate issue before the board involves a pattern of conduct or the cumulative effect of conduct which becomes apparent as a result of conduct which has occurred within the 6-year limitation period prescribed by this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. When an investigation of a complaint against a licensee is determined to be unfounded, the board shall dismiss the complaint and explain in writing to the complainant its reason for dismissing the complaint.  The board may destroy all information collected during the course of the investigation after 3 years.  The board shall retain a record only noting that an investigation was conducted and that the board determined the complaint to be unfounded.  For the purpose of this paragraph, a complaint shall be deemed to be unfounded if it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the board, does not relate to the actions of the licensee, or is determined by the board to be frivolous.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329:18 Investigations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board, through the medical review subcommittee, may investigate possible misconduct by licensees and applicants for licensure, as well as the unauthorized practice of medicine and other matters within the scope of this chapter.  Investigations may be conducted formally, after issuance of a board order setting forth the general scope of the investigation, or informally, without such an order.  In either case, board investigations and the information gathered in such investigations, including information provided to the board under RSA 329:17, I(b), III, IV, and V and RSA 329:18, V, shall be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, except to the extent such information may later become the subject of a public disciplinary hearing.  The board may disclose information acquired in an investigation to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this state or any other jurisdiction, or in response to specific statutory requirements or court orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Any board member who has, or whose spouse or dependents have, a private interest or professional relationship which may directly or indirectly affect or influence the board member's ability to investigate or consider a complaint, shall recuse himself or herself from any investigation or disciplinary action against such licensee.  If the chairperson of the board is recused the remaining board members shall elect an acting chairperson from among the board.  The chairperson or acting chairperson may appoint a former board member to replace the recused board member during the investigation and proceedings against the licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board through the office of professional licensure and certification may retain expert witnesses or other qualified persons to assist with any investigation or adjudicatory proceeding.  Members of the board are not eligible for retainment.  The board may also retain special legal counsel in instances when recommended by the attorney general.  To the extent the board's existing appropriation does not include funds covering such expenditures, the board through the office of professional licensure and certification may request the governor and council to expend funds not otherwise appropriated on the condition that such funds be recovered in the board's next budget at the rate of 125 percent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The form taken by an investigation is a matter reserved to the discretion of the board.  The board may conduct or authorize investigations on an ex parte basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The board, the medical review subcommittee, the board investigator, or the medical review subcommittee investigator, may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony and issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents and things only in a formal investigation or an adjudicatory hearing, except that subpoenas for medical records and pharmacy records, as provided in paragraph V, may be issued at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board, the medical review subcommittee, the board investigator, or the medical review subcommittee investigator, may serve a subpoena on any licensee of the board by certified mail, but shall serve a subpoena on any other person in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules used in superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Persons licensed by the board shall not be entitled to a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state, which are necessary to respond to a subpoena.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any board-issued subpoena related to a board hearing or investigation shall be valid if annotated "Fees Guaranteed by the New Hampshire Board of Medicine.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A minimum of 48 hours' notice shall be given for compliance with a subpoena issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board, the medical review subcommittee, the board investigator, or the medical review subcommittee investigator, may at any time subpoena medical, pharmacy, or billing records related to medical diagnosis or treatment from its licensees, or other health care providers, health care facilities, health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and medical and hospital service corporations licensed or certified in this state to the extent that the records sought are relevant to matters within the board's regulatory authority.  Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal delivery to the address shown on the respondent's current license or certificate, and shall require no witness or other fee.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All licensees shall have the duty to notify the board of their current business and residence addresses.  A licensee shall receive adequate notice of any hearing or other action taken under this chapter if notice is mailed in a timely fashion to the most recent home or business address furnished to the board by the licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The board may at any time require a licensee or license applicant to provide a detailed, good faith written response to allegations of possible professional misconduct or grounds for non-disciplinary remedial action being investigated by the board.  The board may also require the licensee or applicant to provide the board with complete copies of records concerning any patient whose treatment may be material to allegations of possible professional misconduct or grounds for non-disciplinary remedial action being investigated by the board.  Licensees and applicants shall respond to either type of request within 15 days from the date of the request, or within such greater time period as the board may specify.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any person may file a written complaint with the board which charges that a licensee or license applicant has engaged in professional misconduct or should not be licensed.  Such complaints shall be treated as petitions for the commencement of disciplinary proceedings, or if appropriate, non-disciplinary remedial proceedings, shall be investigated by the board, and shall be exempt from the time limitations of RSA 541-A:29.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If an investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee without the consent of a complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute and the complainant is given an opportunity to comment on the terms of the proposed settlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Any health care facility system's deficiencies or concerns identified in the course of an investigation shall be communicated by the board to the administrator of the facility and to the bureau of health facilities administration.  This paragraph shall apply only to health care facilities that are licensed under RSA 151.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Allegations of misconduct or lack of professional qualifications which are not settled informally shall be heard by the board or a panel of the board, with a minimum of 3 members appointed by the president of the board.  The panel for a hearing on a physician-licensee shall consist of a minimum of 2 physicians and one public member.  The panel for a hearing on a physician assistant-licensee shall consist of a minimum of one physician, one physician assistant, and one public member.  Such hearing shall be an open public hearing.  Any member of the board, or other person qualified to act as a hearing officer and duly designated by the board, shall have the authority to preside at such a hearing and to issue oaths or affirmations to witnesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall furnish the respondent and the complainant, if any, at least 15 days' written notice of the date, time and place of a hearing, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  Such notice shall include an itemization of the issues to be heard, and, in the case of a disciplinary hearing, a statement as to whether the action has been initiated by a written complaint or upon the board's own motion, or both.  If a written complaint is involved, the notice shall provide the complainant with a reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may at any time dispose of allegations in a complaint, investigation, or disciplinary hearing by settlement, default, or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for failing to state a proper basis for adverse action or by summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts.  The board shall have discretion to decline or defer prosecution of a complaint which, after appropriate investigation, does not contain allegations of a substantial nature, and may reexamine the allegations in the complaint at any time within the limitations period of RSA 329:17, XII.  In disciplinary and licensing proceedings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but all final disciplinary actions, including those which occur without holding a public hearing, shall be publicly released at the time they are served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Final disciplinary actions and final actions in other adjudicatory proceedings shall be reduced to writing and served upon the parties.  Such decisions shall not be public until they are served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. All proceedings for non-disciplinary remedial action shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, except that the board may disclose any final remedial action that affects the status of a license, including any non-disciplinary restrictions imposed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329:29-a Proceedings of Physician Practice Quality Assurance Program;  Confidentiality. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Physician practice'' means a physician licensed under this chapter, or group of such physicians, or an organization employing such physician or group, together with all licensed professionals and other staff affiliated therewith.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Quality assurance program'' means a comprehensive, ongoing, and organization-wide system of mechanisms established by a physician practice in accordance with rules adopted by the department of health and human services, for monitoring and evaluating the quality and appropriateness of the care provided to patients, so that important problems and trends in the delivery of care are identified and steps are taken to correct problems and to take advantage of opportunities to improve care.  For the purpose of participating in a quality assurance program, physician practices consisting of fewer than 3 physicians shall, while maintaining patient confidentiality, associate with other physician practices so that a quality assurance program shall in all cases involve at least 3 physicians.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Records'' means records of interviews, internal review and investigations, and all reports, statements, minutes, memoranda, charts, statistics, and other documentation generated during the activities of a quality assurance program. "Records'' shall not mean original medical records or other records kept relative to any patient in the course of business of operating as a physician practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Records of a quality assurance program, including those of its functional components and committees, as defined by the physician practice's quality assurance plans, and testimony by persons participating in or appearing before the quality assurance program or its functional components or committees, relating to the activities of the quality assurance program shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.  However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as immune from discovery or use in any such civil or administrative action merely because they were presented to a quality assurance program, and any person who supplies information or testifies as part of a quality assurance program, or who is a member of a quality assurance program committee, may not be prevented from testifying as to matters within his or her knowledge, but such witness may not be asked about his or her testimony before such program, or opinions formed by him or her, as a result of committee participation.  Further, a program's records shall be discoverable in either of the following cases:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A judicial or administrative proceeding brought by a physician practice to revoke or restrict the license or certification of a member physician or staff member;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A proceeding alleging repetitive malicious action and personal injury brought against a physician practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The governing body of a physician practice may waive privileges under this section and release information or present records of the quality assurance program by discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.  Without waiving privileges under this section, the governing body of a physician practice may voluntarily release information or present records to a hospital quality assurance committee established under RSA 151:13-a, which information or records shall be subject to the privileges and immunities set forth in that section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No person or entity shall be held liable in any action for damages or other relief arising from their good faith participation in a quality assurance program, or from the providing of information to a quality assurance program or in any judicial or administrative proceeding.
