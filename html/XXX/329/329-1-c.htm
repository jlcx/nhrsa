&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329:1-c Physician-Patient Relationship. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
"Physician-patient relationship'' means a medical connection between a licensed physician and a patient that includes an in-person exam, a history, a diagnosis, a treatment plan appropriate for the licensee's medical specialty, and documentation of all prescription drugs including name and dosage.  A licensee may prescribe for a patient whom the licensee does not have a physician-patient relationship under the following circumstances:  writing admission orders for a newly hospitalized patient;  for a patient of another licensee for whom the prescriber is taking call;  for a patient examined by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or other licensed practitioner;  or for medication on a short-term basis for a new patient prior to the patient's first appointment or when providing limited treatment to a family member in accordance with the American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics.  Prescribing drugs to individuals without a physician-patient relationship shall be unprofessional conduct subject to discipline under RSA 329:17, VI.  The definition of a physician-patient relationship shall not apply to a physician licensed in another state who is consulting to a New Hampshire licensed physician with whom the patient has a relationship.
