&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 318:52-d Recording and Filing of Prescription. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every person who dispenses, sells, furnishes, or gives away a hypodermic syringe or hypodermic needle or an instrument adapted for the administration of drugs by injection, upon the written or oral prescription of a duly licensed practitioner under RSA 318:52-c, shall record over such person's signature the date of sale or furnishing of the instrument and the number of instruments sold.  This prescription shall be retained on file for a period of 4 years and shall be open to inspection by any public officer or employee engaged in the enforcement of RSA 318 or 318-B.  A prescription filled in accordance with this section shall be sufficient authority, without the necessity of a renewal or reissuance, to permit subsequent sales or the furnishing of hypodermic syringes or hypodermic needles or instruments adapted for the administration of drugs by injection to the person to whom the prescription was issued for a period of one year from the date of its original issuance.
