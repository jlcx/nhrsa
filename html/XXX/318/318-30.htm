The board shall fairly investigate all complaints to the extent and in the manner warranted by the allegations.  A complaint which fails to state a cause of action may be summarily denied in whole or in part.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, permittee, or registrant, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee, permittee, or registrant without the consent of the complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute and the complainant is given an opportunity to comment upon the terms of the proposed settlement.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII.

The board may also require the licensee or other person to furnish complete copies of appropriate office records concerning any patient whose treatment is relevant to the matters at issue.  The licensee or other person shall respond to such request within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days, as the board may specify in its written request.">
