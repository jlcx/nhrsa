&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 318:29-a Impaired Pharmacist Program. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any pharmaceutical peer review committee may report relevant facts to the board relating to the acts of any pharmacist in this state if they have knowledge relating to the pharmacist which, in the opinion of the peer review committee, might provide grounds for disciplinary action as specified in RSA 318:29, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any committee of a professional society comprised primarily of pharmacists, its staff, or any district or local intervenor participating in a program established to aid pharmacists impaired by substance abuse or mental or physical illness may report in writing to the board the name of the impaired pharmacist together with the pertinent information relating to his impairment.  The board may report to any committee of such professional society or the society's designated staff information which it may receive with regard to any pharmacist who may be impaired by substance abuse or mental or physical illness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon a determination by the board that a report submitted by a peer review committee or professional society committee is without merit, the report shall be expunged from the pharmacist's individual record in the board's office.  A pharmacist or his authorized representative shall be entitled on request to examine the pharmacist's peer review or the pharmaceutical organization committee report submitted to the board and to place into the record a statement of reasonable length of the pharmacist's view with respect to any information existing in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 91-A, the records and proceedings of the board, compiled in conjunction with an impaired pharmacist peer review committee, shall be confidential and are not to be considered open records unless the affected pharmacist so requests;  provided, however, the board may disclose this confidential information only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In a disciplinary hearing before the board or in a subsequent trial or appeal of a board action or order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To the pharmacist licensing or disciplinary authorities of other jurisdictions;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) No employee or member of the board, peer review committee member, pharmaceutical organization committee member, pharmaceutical organization district or local intervenor furnishing in good faith information, data, reports, or records for the purpose of aiding the impaired pharmacist shall by reason of furnishing such information be liable for damages to any person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No employee or member of the board or such committee, staff, or intervenor program shall be liable for damages to any person for any action taken or recommendations made by such board, committee, or staff unless he is found to have acted recklessly or wantonly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) The board may contract with other organizations to operate the impaired pharmacist program for pharmacists who are impaired by drug or alcohol abuse or mental or physical illness.  This program shall include, but is not limited to, education, intervention and post-treatment monitoring.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board may allocate $3 from each pharmacist annual license renewal fee it collects to provide funding for the impaired pharmacist program as set forth in subparagraph VI(a).

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon receipt of an administratively final order from the licensing authority of another jurisdiction which imposes disciplinary sanctions against a licensee, permittee, registrant, or certificate holder of the board, or a person applying for a license, permit, registration, or certificate, the board may issue an order directing the licensee, permittee, registrant, or applicant to appear and show cause why similar disciplinary sanctions or, in the case of an applicant, why the license, permit, or registration denial or restriction, should not be imposed in this state.  In any such proceeding, the decision of the foreign licensing authority may not be collaterally attacked, but the licensee, permittee, registrant, or applicant shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate why a lesser sanction should be imposed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may issue any disciplinary sanction or take any action with regard to any pending application pursuant to this section otherwise permitted by this chapter, including sanctions or actions which are more stringent than those imposed by the foreign jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may adopt summary procedures for handling proceedings brought under this chapter, but shall furnish the respondent at least 10 days' written notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 318:30 Investigatory Powers of the Board;  Complaints. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may investigate possible misconduct by licensees, permittees, registrants, certificate holders, applicants, and any other matters governed by the provisions of this chapter and RSA 318-B.  Investigations may be conducted with or without the issuance of a board order setting forth the general scope of the investigation.  Board investigations and any information obtained by the board pursuant to such investigations shall be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, unless such information subsequently becomes the subject of a public disciplinary hearing.  However, the board may disclose information obtained in an investigation to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this state or any other jurisdiction, or in accordance with specific statutory requirements or court orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may appoint legal counsel, technical advisors or other investigators to assist with any investigation and with adjudicatory hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may commence a formal or informal investigation, or an adjudicative hearing, concerning allegations of misconduct and other matters within the scope of this chapter on its own motion whenever it has a reasonable basis for doing so, and the type of procedure chosen shall be a matter reserved to the discretion of the board.  Investigations may be conducted on an ex parte basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The board may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony, and issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents during any formal investigation or adjudicatory hearing.  The board may also subpoena patient records, as provided in paragraph V, during informal investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subpoenas not covered by paragraph V shall be served in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules established by the superior court, except that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Persons licensed or registered by the board shall not be entitled to a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Witness fees and mileage expenses need not be tendered in advance if the subpoena is annotated "Fees Guaranteed by the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The respondent shall be allowed at least 48 hours to comply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board may at any time subpoena medical and pharmacy records from its licensees, registrants, and permittees and from physicians, dentists, veterinarians, advanced registered nurses, hospitals, and other health care providers or facilities licensed by or certified in this state.  Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal delivery to the address shown on the licensee's, registrant's, or permittee's current license, certificate or permit, and no witness or other fee shall be required.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Persons holding or applying for licenses or other privileges granted by the board shall keep the board informed of their current business and residence addresses.  A licensee, permittee, or registrant shall receive adequate notice of any hearing or other action taken under this chapter if notice is mailed in a timely fashion to the most recent home or business address furnished to the board by the licensee, permittee, or registrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Complaints of licensee misconduct shall be in writing and shall be treated as petitions for the commencement of a disciplinary hearing.  The board shall fairly investigate all complaints to the extent and in the manner warranted by the allegations.  A complaint which fails to state a cause of action may be summarily denied in whole or in part.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, permittee, or registrant, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee, permittee, or registrant without the consent of the complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute and the complainant is given an opportunity to comment upon the terms of the proposed settlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. At the commencement of an adjudicatory proceeding, or at any time during a formal or informal investigation, and without issuing a subpoena, the board may mail a statement of the issues being investigated or heard to a licensee or other person who is a proper subject of inquiry and require that licensee or other person to provide a detailed and good faith written response to such statement.  The board may also require the licensee or other person to furnish complete copies of appropriate office records concerning any patient whose treatment is relevant to the matters at issue.  The licensee or other person shall respond to such request within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days, as the board may specify in its written request.

In cases involving imminent danger to life or health, the board may order suspension of a license, permit, registration, certification, or privilege granted under this chapter pending hearing for a period of no more than 60 days.  In such cases, the basis for the board's finding of imminent danger to life or health shall be reduced to writing and combined with a hearing notice which complies with RSA 318:31, II and RSA 541-A:31, III.  Notwithstanding the requirements of RSA 541-A:30, III, the board's hearing may commence as much as 30 days after the date of the order suspending the license, permit, registration, or certification.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall furnish the licensee or any other respondent with at least 15 days' written notice of the date, time and place of a hearing, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  Such notice shall include an itemization of the issues to be heard, and, in the case of a disciplinary hearing, a statement as to whether the action has been initiated by a written complaint or upon the board's own motion, or both.  If a written complaint is involved, the complainant shall also receive a copy of the hearing notice and shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation may be represented by legal counsel, but the board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any such person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may at any time dispose of issues or allegations in an adjudicatory hearing, or an investigation, by default, by settlement agreement or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for failing to state a proper basis for disciplinary action or by summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts.  In disciplinary hearings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but all final disciplinary actions, including those which occur without holding a public hearing, shall be available to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Adjudicatory decisions and final disciplinary actions of the board shall be made by a majority of the board members participating in the decision.  Such decisions shall not be made public until they have been reduced to writing, signed by a representative of the board, and served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Decisions of the board may be appealed to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541.  No disciplinary sanction imposed by the board shall be stayed during appeal if the board determines that the public well-being so requires.
