&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 318:31 Hearings, Decisions and Appeals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Adjudicatory hearings shall be open public proceedings.  Any member of the board may preside at such a hearing and issue oaths or affirmations to witnesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall furnish the licensee or any other respondent with at least 15 days' written notice of the date, time and place of a hearing, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  Such notice shall include an itemization of the issues to be heard, and, in the case of a disciplinary hearing, a statement as to whether the action has been initiated by a written complaint or upon the board's own motion, or both.  If a written complaint is involved, the complainant shall also receive a copy of the hearing notice and shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation may be represented by legal counsel, but the board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any such person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may at any time dispose of issues or allegations in an adjudicatory hearing, or an investigation, by default, by settlement agreement or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for failing to state a proper basis for disciplinary action or by summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts.  In disciplinary hearings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but all final disciplinary actions, including those which occur without holding a public hearing, shall be available to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Adjudicatory decisions and final disciplinary actions of the board shall be made by a majority of the board members participating in the decision.  Such decisions shall not be made public until they have been reduced to writing, signed by a representative of the board, and served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Decisions of the board may be appealed to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541.  No disciplinary sanction imposed by the board shall be stayed during appeal if the board determines that the public well-being so requires.
