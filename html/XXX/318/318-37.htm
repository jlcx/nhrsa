<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person shall conduct or operate a pharmacy for the sale at retail of drugs and medicines unless such pharmacy is registered with and a permit therefor has been issued by the pharmacy board, except as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) No person shall conduct or operate a mail-order pharmacy located outside of this state by shipping, mailing, or delivering prescription drugs into this state unless such pharmacy is registered in New Hampshire and a permit has been issued by the New Hampshire pharmacy board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To obtain a permit, a mail-order pharmacy shall comply with each of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Maintain a license in good standing from the state in which the mail-order pharmacy is located;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Submit to the New Hampshire pharmacy board an application for registration as provided by the New Hampshire pharmacy board;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Pay all appropriate registration fees;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Submit to the New Hampshire pharmacy board a copy of the state pharmacy license from the state in which the mail-order pharmacy is located;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Submit to the New Hampshire pharmacy board a copy of the state and federal controlled substance registrations from the state in which it is located, if controlled substances are to be shipped into this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When requested to do so by the New Hampshire pharmacy board, each mail-order pharmacy shall supply the New Hampshire pharmacy board with any inspection reports, warning notices, disciplinary actions, notice of deficiency reports, or any other related reports from the state in which it is located concerning the operation of a mail-order pharmacy for review of compliance with state and federal drug laws.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Except in emergencies that constitute an immediate threat to the public health and require expedited action by the board, the New Hampshire pharmacy board shall file a complaint with the licensing board of the state in which the mail-order pharmacy is located when known or suspected violations of the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located are uncovered.  If the licensing board in the state in which the mail-order pharmacy is located initiates disciplinary action, the New Hampshire pharmacy board may request the appropriate documents involved in the action for consideration of discipline against the pharmacy registration of the mail-order pharmacy.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The New Hampshire pharmacy board shall extend reciprocal cooperation to any state that licenses and regulates mail-order pharmacies for the purpose of investigating complaints against pharmacies located in New Hampshire or the sharing of information and investigative reports, as long as the other state shall extend the same reciprocal cooperation to the New Hampshire pharmacy board.
