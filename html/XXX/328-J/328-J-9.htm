&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 328-J:9 Temporary Suspension Where Imminent Threat.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In cases involving imminent danger to life or health, the board may order suspension of a license pending hearing for a period of no more than 120 days.  In such cases, the basis for the board's finding of imminent danger to life or health shall be reduced to writing and combined with a hearing notice which complies with RSA 328-J:18, I.  A licensee may be allowed additional time to prepare for a hearing, but any additional time for preparation shall result in an extension of the license suspension commensurate with the additional time extended.
