&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall send, by mail or otherwise, notification of the impending license expiration to each licensee at least 2 months prior to the expiration of the license, along with a request for payment of a renewal fee.  Licensees in good standing may renew their licenses by paying the renewal fee prior to the expiration date of the license, and by presenting evidence satisfactory to the board of completion of the continuing education requirements.  If properly renewed, a license shall remain in effect continuously from the date of issuance, unless suspended or revoked by the board for just cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All licenses issued by the board shall expire on the last day of the licensee's month of birth in the second year following the year of issuance, or upon such other biennial date as the board may adopt.  If the renewal fee is not submitted within 12 months after the expiration date, the licensee's name shall be removed from current status, and application for reinstatement shall be required to return to current status.  The board shall charge a 20 percent late fee for each month or fraction of a month the renewal is late, up to 12 months, in addition to the renewal fee.  Any renewal application received 12 months after the expiration date shall be rejected, unless accompanied by proof of successful completion of the examination required by the board.  Licensees shall complete at least 24 hours of board-approved continuing education during each license period in order to maintain his or her license.  If a licensee fails to renew such license within the 12 months after the date of expiration, it shall become null and void and the licensee shall be required to reapply and to be re-examined for licensure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Licensees who have been activated by the military shall be exempt from any penalties or fees for renewal or reinstatement due to their absence, as approved by the board.
