Applications for licensure or for a temporary license shall be on forms prescribed and furnished by the board, shall contain statements made under oath, showing the applicant's education and a detailed summary of the applicant's technical work.  The board shall establish fees for application and any examination required under this chapter.

II. The board may issue a temporary license to any person whose certification and registration is pending or when issuance is for the purpose of providing medical imaging or radiation therapy services to medically underserved areas as determined by the board.  A temporary license shall be issued only if the board finds that it will not violate the purpose of this chapter or endanger the public health and safety.  A temporary license shall expire 90 days after the date of the next examination if the applicant is required to take an examination.  If the applicant does not take the examination on the scheduled date, the temporary license shall expire.  In all other cases, a temporary license shall expire when the determination is made either to issue or deny the applicant a regular license.  A temporary license shall not be issued for a period longer than 180 days.
