&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 325:32-a Reciprocal Discipline. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon receipt of a final order from the licensing authority of another jurisdiction which imposes disciplinary sanctions against a licensee or a person applying for a license, the board may issue an order directing the licensee or applicant to appear and show cause why similar disciplinary sanctions or, in the case of an applicant, license denial or restriction, should not be imposed in this state.  In any such proceeding, the decision of the foreign licensing authority may not be collaterally attacked, but the licensee or applicant shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate why a lesser sanction should be imposed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may commence a formal or informal investigation, or an adjudicative hearing, concerning allegations of misconduct and other matters within the scope of this chapter on its own motion whenever it has a reasonable basis for doing so, and the type of procedure chosen shall be a matter reserved to the discretion of the board.  Formal or informal investigations may be conducted on an ex parte basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony, and issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents during any formal investigation or adjudicatory hearing, and as provided by paragraph IV of this section.  Subpoenas not addressed in paragraph IV shall be served in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules established by the superior court, except that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Board licensees shall not be entitled to a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Witness fees and mileage expenses need not be tendered in advance if the subpoena is annotated "Fees Guaranteed by the New Hampshire Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The respondent shall be allowed at least 48 hours to comply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may at any time subpoena the professional records of its licensees and relevant health care records from physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers or facilities licensed or certified by this state.  Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal delivery to the address provided to the board pursuant to paragraph VI, and no witness or other fee shall be necessary for valid service.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A person holding or applying for licenses or other privileges granted by the board shall keep the board informed of such person's current business and residence addresses, and shall furnish written notice to the board of any change in such address within 30 days from the date the change occurs.  A licensee or applicant shall have received adequate notice of any hearing or other action taken under this chapter if notice is mailed in a timely fashion to the most recent home or business address furnished under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Complaints of licensee misconduct shall be in writing, and shall be treated as requests for the commencement of a disciplinary hearing to which the time limitations of RSA 541-A:29 shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A complaint which fails to state a cause of action may be dismissed or summarily denied in whole or in part.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The board shall fairly investigate all complaints to the extent warranted by the allegations and the resources available to the board.  Following an investigation, the board shall have discretion to decline to prosecute or to defer prosecution on allegations made in any complaint based upon the board's assessment of the seriousness of the alleged misconduct and the resources and priorities of the board.  Board decisions deferring misconduct prosecutions shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The board may at any time settle misconduct allegations made in a complaint without the consent of the complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute and the complainant is given an opportunity to comment in writing upon the terms of the proposed settlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The board may issue any disciplinary sanction or take any action with regard to any pending application pursuant to this section otherwise permitted by this chapter, including sanctions or actions which are more stringent than those imposed by the foreign jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board may adopt summary procedures for handling proceedings brought under this chapter, but shall furnish the respondent at least 10 days' written notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.  The board may require a licensee to suspend practice in this state as a condition of postponing a hearing date established for allegations brought under this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 325:33 Investigatory Powers of the Board;  Complaints. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may investigate possible misconduct by licensees, and applicants, and any other matters within the scope of this chapter.  Investigations may be conducted with or without the issuance of a board order setting forth the general scope of the investigation.  Board investigations and information obtained by the board pursuant to such investigations, including complaints received under RSA 325:32, I(b), shall be privileged, confidential, and exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, unless such information is subsequently included in the record in a public disciplinary hearing.  The board may disclose information obtained in its investigations to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this state or any other jurisdiction or in accordance with specific statutory requirements or court orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The board may appoint technical advisors or other investigators to assist with any investigation or adjudication, and may, with the approval of the attorney general, appoint legal counsel for such purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To the extent the board lacks budgeted funds to conduct a significant investigation or adjudication, it may, with the approval of the attorney general, petition governor and counsel to receive funds not otherwise appropriated in order to retain professional advisors in the proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the governor and counsel approves the use of funds not otherwise appropriated, the governor is authorized to issue a warrant for the approved amount out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.  The board shall then promptly increase its licensing fees to the extent necessary to repay the amount advanced to the general fund during the next fiscal year by means of a fee surcharge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At the commencement of an adjudicatory proceeding, or at any time during a formal or informal investigation, and without issuing a subpoena, the board, or a person to whom the board has delegated appropriate authority, may mail a statement of the allegations being investigated to a licensee and order that person to provide a detailed and good faith written response to the allegations.  In such circumstances, the board may also require a licensee to furnish complete copies of appropriate professional records concerning matters relevant to allegations at issue.  In both instances, the licensee shall respond within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days, as the board may specify in its written order.

(b) If the person acting as a presiding officer prepares a recommended decision, that person shall not participate in the board's deliberations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a nonboard member acts as a presiding officer, and no recommended decision is prepared, that person may participate in board deliberations only to the extent of providing technical assistance to the board in preparing its final decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Except as otherwise provided by this chapter or RSA 541-A:30, respondents in an adjudicatory proceeding shall receive at least 15 days' written notice of the date, time, and place of a hearing.  Hearing notices shall include an itemization of the issues to be heard and shall be public documents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a board issues a hearing notice after investigation of allegations contained in a written complaint, the hearing notice shall constitute a final determination of the complainant's request for the commencement of a disciplinary proceeding on each of the allegations raised in the complaint.  The hearing notice shall be served upon the complainant as well as the licensee, and shall provide the complainant with an opportunity to intervene subject to restrictions which reasonably advance the public interest objectives of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person appearing as a party or witness in an adjudicatory proceeding, or any person who is the subject of an investigation, or who is questioned in an investigation, is entitled to be represented by legal counsel, but the board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any such person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In adjudicatory proceedings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which are closed to the public and, except as provided in paragraph VI of this section, exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A until such time as a public evidentiary hearing is convened.  In all instances, settlement discussions engaged in by the parties at prehearing conferences may be conducted off the record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board may dispose of issues or allegations at any time during an investigation or adjudicatory proceeding by issuing a settlement agreement or consent order, an order of dismissal for default or failure to state a proper basis for disciplinary action, or a summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts.  Disciplinary action taken by the board at any stage of a proceeding, and any dispositive action taken after the issuance of a public hearing notice, shall be reduced to writing and made available to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Decisions in adjudicatory proceedings shall be made by a majority of the board members eligible to participate in the decision, and the board's deliberative processes in adjudicatory proceedings shall be privileged and exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A.  Decisions and orders in adjudicatory proceedings, including prehearing orders required by RSA 541-A:31, V(d), shall be publicly available, but only after they have been reduced to writing, signed by a representative of the board, and served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Final disciplinary actions taken by the board may be appealed to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541 and shall not be subject to stay pending appeal.
