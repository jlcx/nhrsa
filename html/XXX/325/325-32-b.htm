&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 325:32-b Temporary Suspension. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In cases involving imminent danger of life or health, the board may order suspension of a license or privilege granted under this chapter pending hearing for a period of no more than 60 days.  In such cases, the basis for the board's finding of imminent danger of life or health shall be in writing and combined with a hearing notice which complies with RSA 325:34, III and RSA 541-A:31, III.  Notwithstanding the requirements of RSA 541-A:30, III, the board's hearing may commence no more than 30 days after the date of the order suspending the license.  If the board does not commence the hearing within 30 days, the suspension order shall be automatically vacated, but a licensee shall be allowed additional time to prepare for or to complete a hearing under this section only by agreeing to a further suspension commensurate with the additional time extension.
