&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 320:14 Revocation of Licenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any license granted by the secretary of state may be revoked by him after hearing (1) upon conviction of the licensee of any offense which in the judgment of the secretary of state warrants such revocation or (2) upon the submission to the secretary of state of evidence satisfactory to him that, during the term of the license, and acting under cover thereof, the licensee has accepted or solicited money, otherwise than through a bona fide sale or barter of goods, wares or merchandise or has in any manner solicited alms from the public, or (3) upon a finding by him that the applicant has wilfully falsified his application for license or (4) upon consideration of evidence that the holder of said license is insane, a sexual psychopath, is or has been guilty of assault upon others or whose conduct has been otherwise disorderly and is of such violent or offensive demeanor that to permit him to retain such license would constitute a threat to the peace or safety of the public or (5) that the holder of said license is at large pending appeal from a conviction for a violation of the law involving extreme moral turpitude.  Whenever any person is convicted of a violation of any provision of this chapter relative to hawkers and peddlers, the clerk of the court or the trial justice by whom such person was convicted shall notify the secretary of state.  Any person whose license has been revoked under this section shall be ineligible to be licensed as a hawker or peddler in this state for a period of not less than one year or more than 5 years from the date of said revocation.  Any person whose license has been revoked, as a condition precedent to issuance of any new license, shall be required to furnish to the revoking authority satisfactory evidence of renewed reputation and character or mental health in addition to the certificate required to qualify for such license under RSA 320:8.
