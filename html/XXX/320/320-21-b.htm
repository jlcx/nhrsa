&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 320:21-b When Assignee Not Subject to Defenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
With respect to a consumer credit sale or consumer lease, by a hawker or peddler, other than a sale or lease primarily for an agricultural purpose, an assignee of the rights of the hawker or peddler is subject to all claims and defenses of the buyer or lessee against the hawker or peddler arising out of the sale or lease notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary, but the assignee's liability under this section may not exceed the amount owing to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against the assignee.  Rights of the buyer or lessee under this section can only be asserted as a matter of defense to or set-off against a claim by the assignee.
