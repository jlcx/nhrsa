<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In cases involving imminent danger to life or health, the board may order suspension of a license pending hearing for a period of not more than 90 days.  In such cases, the basis for the board's finding of imminent danger to life or health shall be reduced to writing and combined with a hearing notice which complies with RSA 329-B:23, II.  A licensee may be allowed additional time to prepare for a hearing, but any additional time for preparation shall result in an extension of license suspension commensurate with the additional time extended.
