&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329-B:22 Investigations and Complaints. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall investigate alleged misconduct by licensees and other matters within the scope of this chapter.  Investigations may be conducted formally, after issuance of a board order setting forth the general scope of the investigation, or informally, after a board vote to seek additional information, without such an order.  In either case, information gathered subsequent to the initiation of and during such investigations shall be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, except to the extent such information may later become the subject of a public disciplinary hearing.  The existence of a complaint and status of the investigation, without disclosing the identity of those involved, shall be subject to the disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A.  The board may disclose information acquired in an investigation to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this state or any other jurisdiction, or in response to specific statutory requirements or court orders.  A licensee under this chapter shall be promptly informed of the nature and scope of any pending investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any board member who has had a personal relationship or has worked in a professional capacity with a complainant or with a licensee against whom a complaint has been filed or whose personal or professional views regarding the licensee or the complainant could prevent the board member from being impartial in considering the complaint shall recuse himself or herself from any investigation or disciplinary action against such licensee.  If the chairperson of the board is recused the remaining board members shall elect an acting chairperson from among the board.  The chairperson or acting chairperson shall appoint a former board member or a member from the advisory committee to replace the recused board member during the investigation and proceedings against the licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. After determining the nature and scope of an investigation or hearing, the board may employ or retain hearing officers, legal counsel, medical advisors, psychologist advisors, or investigators through the office of professional licensure and certification to assist with that investigation or hearing.  Members of the board are not eligible for retention.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The form taken by an investigation is a matter reserved to the discretion of the board.  The board may, with just cause, conduct investigations on an ex parte basis only if there is an imminent danger to life or health of a client or patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The board or its designee may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony, and issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents and objects only in a formal investigation or an adjudicatory hearing, except that subpoenas for psychological records as provided in paragraph VI may be issued at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board may serve a subpoena on a licensee by certified mail in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules used in superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any subpoena related to appearance at a hearing or investigatory proceeding issued by the board shall be annotated "Fees Guaranteed by the New Hampshire Board of Psychologists'' in order to be valid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A minimum of 48 hours' notice shall be given for compliance with a subpoena issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board may, with just cause, at any time subpoena psychological records from its licensees and from hospitals and other health care providers licensed in this state.  Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal delivery to the address shown on the respondent's current license.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. All licensees shall have the duty to notify the board of their current business and residence addresses, and shall notify the board of any change to either address within 30 days of the change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Except for good cause shown, upon its determination that a formal or informal investigation shall be conducted, the board shall mail a copy of a complaint to any licensee who is the subject of the complaint, and require the licensee to provide a detailed and good faith written response to allegations identified by the board.  The licensee shall provide complete copies of the licensee's office records concerning any client or patient identified in the complaint.  The licensee shall respond to such request within a reasonable time period of not less than 30 days, as the board shall specify in its written request.  The detailed complaint and licensee's response shall be exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A unless the licensee successfully petitions the board to make them available pursuant to RSA 91-A:4.  The patient's record shall be exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The board may dismiss complaints when the undisputed allegations do not warrant disciplinary actions and may settle complaints informally with the consent of the licensee.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board chooses to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If an investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee without the consent of a complainant, provided that the complainant is given an opportunity to comment on the terms of the proposed settlement.
