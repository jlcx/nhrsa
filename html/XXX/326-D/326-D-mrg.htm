&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 326-D:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that the practice of midwifery has been a part of the culture and tradition of New Hampshire since colonial days and that it is in the public interest to remove impediments to the practice of midwifery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For personal and economic reasons some New Hampshire citizens will have home births.  It is the intent of the general court to preserve the rights of women to deliver children at home, to remove obstacles to safe out-of-hospital deliveries, and to assure quality care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The general court further finds that childbirth is a culmination of pregnancy and is a natural process rather than an illness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The general court acknowledges that the services of a certified midwife are a reasonable alternative for healthy pregnant women.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The general court hereby intends that the scope of practice of midwifery shall be modeled on The International Definition of Midwifery as accepted by the World Health Organization and the International Confederation of Midwives.  However, in no event shall the scope of midwifery practice exceed the parameters of the definition of "midwifery'' under RSA 326-D:2, V.
