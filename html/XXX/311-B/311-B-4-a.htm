I. Whenever the board has reasonable cause to believe that any person is engaging in the business of auctioneering without obtaining a license as provided in this chapter or without being an authorized business organization under this chapter, or has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter, or any rule or order under this chapter, the board may, in addition to all actions provided for in this chapter, enter an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such violation.  Delivery of such order shall be by hand or registered mail at the principal office of the licensee or other person.  The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the rights of the person to request a hearing on the order and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order.  A hearing shall be held not later than 10 days after the request for such hearing is received by the board after which and within 20 days of the date of the hearing the board shall issue a further order vacating the cease and desist order or making it permanent as the facts require.  All hearings shall comply with RSA 541-A.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, the person shall be deemed in default, and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt of such order, then such person shall likewise be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the board, for good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any person refuses to obey such order, an action may be brought by the board or by the attorney general on the board's behalf in any superior court in this state to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation.  In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding a temporary or permanent injunction, and awarding the board or the attorney general or both costs in bringing such action.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.
