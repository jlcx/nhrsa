&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 316-A:1 Definition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The science of chiropractic deals with the analysis of any interference with normal nerve transmission and expression, the procedure preparatory to, and complementary to the correction thereof, by an adjustment of the articulations of the vertebral column and its immediate articulations for the restoration and maintenance of health;  it includes the normal regimen and rehabilitation of the patient using the procedures which are currently taught in accredited chiropractic colleges at the time of matriculation without the use of drugs, surgery, or colonic irrigation.  The term analysis is construed to include physical examination, the use of x-ray and other analytical instruments generally used in the practice of chiropractic.  The terms adjustment, manipulation, and subluxation are primary to the practice of chiropractic and shall therefore be specifically defined in rules adopted by the board of chiropractic examiners.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
