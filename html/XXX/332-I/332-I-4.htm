&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A health care provider, or a business associate of the health care provider, shall obtain an authorization for any use or disclosure of protected health information for marketing.  Such authorization shall meet the authorization implementation specifications for marketing under the regulations adopted pursuant to sections 262 and 264 of HIPAA, as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) For use or disclosure of protected health information for fundraising, a health care provider, or a business associate of the health care provider, shall, in a clear and conspicuous manner, provide an opportunity for any intended recipient of one or more fundraising communications to elect not to receive such communications.  A clear and conspicuous opportunity shall include, but not be limited to, simple election language and type of a sufficient size as to be easily readable by the average adult reader.  Such opportunity shall be provided:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Sixty days prior to any fundraising communication;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Upon presentation of the notice of privacy practices required by regulations adopted pursuant to sections 262 and 264 of HIPAA, as amended, if such notice is given to the intended recipient prior to any fundraising communication;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) To an individual who does not elect to not receive fundraising communications in the opportunities in subparagraph (1) or (2), in any subsequent written fundraising communications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When an individual elects not to receive any fundraising communication, such election shall be treated as a revocation of authorization under 45 C.F.R. section 164.508.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Protected health information disclosed for marketing or fundraising shall not be disclosed by voice mail, an unattended facsimile, or through other methods of communication that are not secure.
