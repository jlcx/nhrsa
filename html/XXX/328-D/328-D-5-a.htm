&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any licensee who fails to apply for renewal under RSA 328-D:5 shall pay double the renewal fee, provided the licensee applies and pays the renewal fee no later than 90 days after the expiration date.  Any licensee who fails to apply for renewal of his or her license within the 90-day period after expiration, shall have his or her license lapse.  A lapsed license shall be reinstated only upon payment of a reinstatement fee as established by the board, and upon showing evidence of professional competence as the board may reasonably require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a license expires or lapses as a result of a licensee being ordered to active duty with the armed services, the licensee shall have 90 days from the date of discharge or release from the armed service to apply for renewal and all late fees shall be waived.
