&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 321:7 Cancellation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any state license may be surrendered for cancellation at any time.  Upon the expiration and return or surrender of any state license, the secretary of state shall cancel the same, endorse the date of delivery and cancellation thereon and place it on file.  He shall thereafter hold the special deposit provided for in RSA 321:4 for 60 days.  The secretary of state shall satisfy all claims made against any itinerant vendor from the cash deposited by such vendor, or by demanding payment of such claims from the issuer of any bond filed on behalf of such vendor.  After satisfying the claims made upon the deposit under RSA 321:8, the secretary of state shall return the balance of any cash deposit to the licensee.  No deposit shall be paid to the licensee so long as there are notices of outstanding claims against it.
