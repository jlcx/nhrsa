<codesect>
The board may issue, upon payment of the required fee, appropriate licenses without examination to a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company engaged in the business of plumbing, provided one or more officers of the corporation, one or more members of the partnership, or one or more managing members of the limited liability company, holds a master plumber's license under this chapter.  Within 30 days after the death or withdrawal of the licensed person as a corporate officer or member of the partnership, he, she, or it shall give notice thereof to the board and, if no other officer or partner is a licensed master plumber, the corporation or partnership shall not act as a master plumber until some other officer or member has obtained a license.
