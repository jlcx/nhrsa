I. Any person who has acted as a water treatment trainee for a period of not less than one year shall, upon payment of the fees established by the board, be entitled to examination and, upon achieving the passing score on the examination, be certified as a water treatment technician.  A certificate issued under this section shall be carried on the person and displayed at any time upon request.  Any person failing to achieve the passing score on the examination may be examined as often as he or she may desire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The title "certified water treatment technician'' shall be used only by persons and business entities certified under this chapter.  No person shall continue to represent himself or herself and no business entity shall continue to represent itself as a certified water treatment technician after certification has been revoked or nonrenewed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may issue, upon payment of the required fees, certification without examination to a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other business entity that installs, maintains, or repairs water treatment systems, provided the entity designates one employee certified under this chapter who is responsible for the entity's compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted by the board.  Within 30 days after termination of employment of such employee by such entity, he or she shall give notice thereof to the board and, if no other employee is certified under this chapter, the entity shall not represent itself as employing certified water treatment technicians until some other employee has obtained certification.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the board shall not require an additional fee for an entity that installs, maintains, or repairs water treatment systems where the person certified under this chapter is the sole owner of the entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may issue certification without examination to those water treatment technicians who provide adequate documentation of having operated in the capacity of a water treatment technician for a period of at least one year prior to January 1, 2004 and who pay the required fees.
