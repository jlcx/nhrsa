&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A plaintiff under this chapter, subject to paragraph II, may request an ex parte prejudgment attachment order from the court against all assets of a defendant sufficient to satisfy a potential award.  If attachment is instituted, a defendant is entitled to an immediate hearing.  Attachment may be lifted if the defendant demonstrates that the assets will be available for a potential award or if the defendant posts a bond sufficient to cover a potential award.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any assets sought to satisfy a judgment under this chapter that are named in a forfeiture action or have been seized for forfeiture by any state or federal agency may not be used to satisfy a judgment unless and until the assets have been released following the conclusion of the forfeiture action or released by the agency that seized the assets.
