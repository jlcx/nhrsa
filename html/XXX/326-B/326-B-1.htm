&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 326-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In order to safeguard the life, health, and public welfare of the people of New Hampshire and in order to protect the people of the state from the unauthorized, unqualified, and improper application of services by individuals in the practice of nursing, it is necessary that a regulatory authority be established and adequately funded.  To further this policy, the practice of nursing shall be regulated through the New Hampshire board of nursing, and such board shall have the power to enforce the provisions of this chapter.  Licensees under this chapter are accountable to clients, the nursing profession, and the board for complying with the requirements of this act and the quality of nursing care rendered, and for recognizing limits of knowledge and experience and planning for management of situations beyond the licensee's experience.
