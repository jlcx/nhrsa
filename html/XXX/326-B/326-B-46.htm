<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE III</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
General Provisions and Jurisdiction<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A license to practice registered nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a registered nurse in such party state.  A license to practice licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a licensed practical/vocational nurse in such party state.  In order to obtain or retain a license, an applicant must meet the home state's qualifications for licensure and license renewal as well as all other applicable state laws.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Party states may, in accordance with state due process laws, limit or revoke the multistate licensure privilege of any nurse to practice in their states and may take any other actions under their applicable state laws necessary to protect the health and safety of their citizens.  If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Every nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered.  In addition, the practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of a party state.  The practice of nursing will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the nurse licensing board and the courts, as well as the laws, in that party state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing.  However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as a license to practice registered nursing if one is required by state law as a precondition for qualifying for advanced practice registered nurse authorization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for nurse licensure as provided for under the laws of each party state.  However, the license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state unless explicitly agreed to by that party state.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE IV</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Applications for Licensure in a Party State<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon application for a license, the licensing board in a party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any restrictions on the multistate licensure privilege, and whether any other adverse action by any state has been taken against the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A nurse in a party state shall hold licensure in only one party state at a time, issued by the home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A nurse who intends to change primary state of residence may apply for licensure in the new home state in advance of such change.  However, new licenses will not be issued by a party state until after a nurse provides evidence of change in primary state of residence satisfactory to the new home state's licensing board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When a nurse changes primary state of residence by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Moving between 2 party states, and obtains a license from the new home state, the license from the former home state is no longer valid;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Moving from a nonparty state to a party state, and obtains a license from the new home state, the individual state license issued by the nonparty state is not affected and will remain in full force if so provided by the laws of the nonparty state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the license issued by the prior home state converts to an individual state license, valid only in the former home state, without the multistate licensure privilege to practice in other party states.

<b>ARTICLE V</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Adverse Actions<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In addition to the general provisions described in Article III, the following provisions apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The licensing board of a remote state shall promptly report to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system any remote state actions including the factual and legal basis for such action, if known.  The licensing board of a remote state shall also promptly report any significant current investigative information yet to result in a remote state action.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The licensing board of a party state shall have the authority to complete any pending investigations for a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations.  It shall also have the authority to take appropriate action, and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.  However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action against the license issued by the home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For purposes of imposing adverse action, the licensing board of the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, so long as each state follows its own procedures for imposing such adverse action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of licensure action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the party state's laws.  Party states must require nurses who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in any other party state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from such other party state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.  The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located.

Applications for Licensure in a Party State
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.

Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations.  The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate actions and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence.  Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it.  The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license.  All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.  The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.

</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs).  This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(h) If no one appears at the public hearing, the commission may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Prevent a loss of commission or party state funds;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Meet a deadline for the adoption of an administrative rule that is required by federal law or rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) The commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency or grammatical errors.  Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission.  The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.  The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the commission, prior to the end of the notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.  If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.

<p>
Oversight, Dispute Resolution and Enforcement
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Oversight.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or adopted rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Default, Technical Assistance and Termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the adopted rules, the commission shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the commission;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Dispute Resolution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and nonparty states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Enforcement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provision and rules of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its adopted rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.

ARTICLE XI
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Construction and Severability
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.
