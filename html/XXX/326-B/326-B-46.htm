<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Findings and Declaration of Purpose<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The party states find that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant to both nurses and states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The general purposes of this compact are to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE III</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
General Provisions and Jurisdiction<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A license to practice registered nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a registered nurse in such party state.  A license to practice licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a licensed practical/vocational nurse in such party state.  In order to obtain or retain a license, an applicant must meet the home state's qualifications for licensure and license renewal as well as all other applicable state laws.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Party states may, in accordance with state due process laws, limit or revoke the multistate licensure privilege of any nurse to practice in their states and may take any other actions under their applicable state laws necessary to protect the health and safety of their citizens.  If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Every nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered.  In addition, the practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of a party state.  The practice of nursing will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the nurse licensing board and the courts, as well as the laws, in that party state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing.  However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as a license to practice registered nursing if one is required by state law as a precondition for qualifying for advanced practice registered nurse authorization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for nurse licensure as provided for under the laws of each party state.  However, the license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state unless explicitly agreed to by that party state.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE IV</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Applications for Licensure in a Party State<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon application for a license, the licensing board in a party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any restrictions on the multistate licensure privilege, and whether any other adverse action by any state has been taken against the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A nurse in a party state shall hold licensure in only one party state at a time, issued by the home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A nurse who intends to change primary state of residence may apply for licensure in the new home state in advance of such change.  However, new licenses will not be issued by a party state until after a nurse provides evidence of change in primary state of residence satisfactory to the new home state's licensing board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When a nurse changes primary state of residence by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Moving between 2 party states, and obtains a license from the new home state, the license from the former home state is no longer valid;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Moving from a nonparty state to a party state, and obtains a license from the new home state, the individual state license issued by the nonparty state is not affected and will remain in full force if so provided by the laws of the nonparty state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the license issued by the prior home state converts to an individual state license, valid only in the former home state, without the multistate licensure privilege to practice in other party states.

<p>
<b>ARTICLE V</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Adverse Actions<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In addition to the general provisions described in Article III, the following provisions apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The licensing board of a remote state shall promptly report to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system any remote state actions including the factual and legal basis for such action, if known.  The licensing board of a remote state shall also promptly report any significant current investigative information yet to result in a remote state action.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The licensing board of a party state shall have the authority to complete any pending investigations for a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations.  It shall also have the authority to take appropriate action, and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.  However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action against the license issued by the home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For purposes of imposing adverse action, the licensing board of the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, so long as each state follows its own procedures for imposing such adverse action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of licensure action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the party state's laws.  Party states must require nurses who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in any other party state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from such other party state.

<br>
