&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 326-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In order to safeguard the life, health, and public welfare of the people of New Hampshire and in order to protect the people of the state from the unauthorized, unqualified, and improper application of services by individuals in the practice of nursing, it is necessary that a regulatory authority be established and adequately funded.  To further this policy, the practice of nursing shall be regulated through the New Hampshire board of nursing, and such board shall have the power to enforce the provisions of this chapter.  Licensees under this chapter are accountable to clients, the nursing profession, and the board for complying with the requirements of this act and the quality of nursing care rendered, and for recognizing limits of knowledge and experience and planning for management of situations beyond the licensee's experience.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 326-B:38 Investigations and Hearings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall investigate possible misconduct by licensees and other matters governed by the provisions of this chapter.  Investigations shall be conducted with or without the issuance of a board order setting forth the general scope of the investigation.  Board investigations and any information obtained by the board pursuant to such investigations shall be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, unless such information subsequently becomes part of a public disciplinary hearing.  However, the board may disclose information acquired in an investigation to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this state or any other jurisdiction, or in accordance with specific statutory requirements or court orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may appoint legal counsel, health care advisors, or other investigators to assist with any investigation and with adjudicative hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The form taken by an investigation is a matter within the discretion of the board.  The board may conduct investigations on an ex parte basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The board may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony, and issue subpoenas for witnesses, documents, and things, relative to investigations or adjudicative hearings, except that subpoenas for records issued pursuant to paragraph V may be issued at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board may serve a subpoena on any licensee by certified mail, but shall serve a subpoena on any other person in accordance with the procedures and the fee schedules established by the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person licensed by the board shall not be entitled to a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state related to his or her appearance at a hearing or investigatory proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In order to be valid, any subpoena issued by the board, except one issued to a licensee, shall be annotated "Fees guaranteed by the New Hampshire board of nursing.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A minimum of 48 hours' notice shall be given for compliance with a subpoena issued under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board may at any time subpoena a licensee's health care records, employment records, and nursing education academic records in the possession of its licensees, nursing education programs licensed by the board, or hospitals, and other health care providers and facilities regulated in this state, except that it may not subpoena quality assurance records of health facilities licensed under RSA 151.  Subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or personal delivery to the address currently on file with the board in the case of delivery to a licensee.  No witness or other fee shall be required.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena issued under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Complaints of licensee misconduct shall be in writing and shall be treated as petitions for the commencement of a disciplinary hearing.  The board shall determine whether a complaint alleges misconduct sufficient to support disciplinary proceedings.  If the board determines that it does, the board shall forward a copy of the complaint to the licensee complained against within 5 business days of its determination.  If the board determines that it does not, the board shall send the complainant a written notice of dismissal of the complaint.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If an investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee without the consent of a complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. At any time during an investigation of a complaint, and without issuing a subpoena, the board may mail a copy of a complaint to the licensee named in the complaint, and may require in a written request that the licensee and the licensee's employer provide detailed and good faith written responses to allegations identified by the board and also provide copies of all records concerning any client identified in the complaint.  The licensee and others receiving inquiries from the board shall respond within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days as the board may specify.  This procedure may also be used in connection with matters the board has undertaken to investigate on its own motion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board may hold adjudicative hearings concerning allegations of misconduct or other matters within the scope of this chapter.  Such hearings shall be public proceedings.  Any member of the board other than the public members, or any other qualified person appointed by the board, shall have authority to preside at such a hearing and to issue oaths or affirmations to witnesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The board shall give the respondent and the complainant, if any, at least 15 days' written notice of the date, time, and place of a hearing, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  Such notice shall comply with RSA 541-A and include an itemization of the issues to be heard, and, in the case of a disciplinary hearing, a statement as to whether the action has been initiated by a written complaint or upon the board's own motion, or both.  If a written complaint is involved, the notice shall provide the complainant with a reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.  Such notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the complainant and to the respondent at the address provided by the respondent currently on file at the board offices.  Notice mailed in compliance with this section shall be deemed served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The board may at any time dispose of allegations in a complaint, investigation, or disciplinary hearing by settlement, default, or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for failing to state a proper basis for disciplinary action, or by summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts.  In disciplinary hearings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but any final disciplinary action or decision which occurs without holding a public hearing shall be publicly released at the time it is served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Final disciplinary actions and other adjudicative decisions made by the board shall be in writing and served upon the parties.  Such decisions shall not be released to the public until they are served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation may be represented by legal counsel or other representative, but the board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide such representation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The board shall hear any complaint not resolved at or prior to a preliminary hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. In the case of sanctions for discipline in another jurisdiction, the decision of the other jurisdiction's disciplinary authority may not be collaterally attacked and the board may impose any of the sanctions set forth in this chapter, but shall provide notice and an opportunity to be heard if it intends to impose sanctions above those imposed by the other jurisdiction.

<codesect>
The nurse licensure compact is adopted and entered into with all other jurisdictions that legally join the compact, which is substantially as follows:
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE I</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Findings and Declaration of Purpose<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The party states find that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant to both nurses and states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The general purposes of this compact are to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses.

<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE III</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
General Provisions and Jurisdiction<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A license to practice registered nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a registered nurse in such party state.  A license to practice licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a licensed practical/vocational nurse in such party state.  In order to obtain or retain a license, an applicant must meet the home state's qualifications for licensure and license renewal as well as all other applicable state laws.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Party states may, in accordance with state due process laws, limit or revoke the multistate licensure privilege of any nurse to practice in their states and may take any other actions under their applicable state laws necessary to protect the health and safety of their citizens.  If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Every nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered.  In addition, the practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of a party state.  The practice of nursing will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the nurse licensing board and the courts, as well as the laws, in that party state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing.  However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as a license to practice registered nursing if one is required by state law as a precondition for qualifying for advanced practice registered nurse authorization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for nurse licensure as provided for under the laws of each party state.  However, the license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state unless explicitly agreed to by that party state.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE IV</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Applications for Licensure in a Party State<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon application for a license, the licensing board in a party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any restrictions on the multistate licensure privilege, and whether any other adverse action by any state has been taken against the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A nurse in a party state shall hold licensure in only one party state at a time, issued by the home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A nurse who intends to change primary state of residence may apply for licensure in the new home state in advance of such change.  However, new licenses will not be issued by a party state until after a nurse provides evidence of change in primary state of residence satisfactory to the new home state's licensing board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When a nurse changes primary state of residence by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Moving between 2 party states, and obtains a license from the new home state, the license from the former home state is no longer valid;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Moving from a nonparty state to a party state, and obtains a license from the new home state, the individual state license issued by the nonparty state is not affected and will remain in full force if so provided by the laws of the nonparty state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the license issued by the prior home state converts to an individual state license, valid only in the former home state, without the multistate licensure privilege to practice in other party states.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE V</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Adverse Actions<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In addition to the general provisions described in Article III, the following provisions apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The licensing board of a remote state shall promptly report to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system any remote state actions including the factual and legal basis for such action, if known.  The licensing board of a remote state shall also promptly report any significant current investigative information yet to result in a remote state action.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The licensing board of a party state shall have the authority to complete any pending investigations for a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations.  It shall also have the authority to take appropriate action, and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.  However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action against the license issued by the home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For purposes of imposing adverse action, the licensing board of the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, so long as each state follows its own procedures for imposing such adverse action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of licensure action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the party state's laws.  Party states must require nurses who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in any other party state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from such other party state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states' licensing boards shall promptly report adverse actions, actions against multistate licensure privileges, any current significant investigative information yet to result in adverse action, denials of applications, and the reasons for such denials, to the coordinated licensure information system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Current significant investigative information shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information, shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
