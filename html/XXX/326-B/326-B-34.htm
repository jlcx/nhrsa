I. If, during the course of diagnosis or treatment by a licensee, a client alleges that another mental health counselor or health care practitioner licensed by the board of nursing or another state licensing or certifying agency has engaged with the client in sexual relations, the licensee shall have a duty to inform the client that the act reported by the client may be unprofessional or unethical and may subject the actor to disciplinary action by the actor's licensing or certifying agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No liability for breach of client confidentiality, slander, or defamation, or other civil or criminal liability, shall arise from the disclosure by a licensee of information related to reported sexual relations between a client and any mental health counselor or health care licensee of a state licensing or certifying agency when the disclosure is made in good faith and made to the board or any other state licensing or certifying agency.
