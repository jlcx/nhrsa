&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 310-A:90 Failure to Renew. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Failure to remit the biennial renewal fee when due shall automatically cancel the certification.  If properly renewed, a certification shall remain in effect continuously from the date of issuance, unless suspended or revoked by the board for just cause.  A person whose certification is cancelled for such failure may reinstate such certification by paying, within one year of cancellation, all fees due, plus a late fee as established by the board.
