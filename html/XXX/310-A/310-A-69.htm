II. The secretary of state shall not issue a certificate of incorporation to any applicant for incorporation or for registration as a foreign business organization which includes the words "surveyor'' or "surveying'' or any modification or derivative thereof in its business name, or which includes the practice of land surveying among the objects for which it is established, unless the board shall have issued, with respect to such applicant, a certificate of authorization or eligibility for authorization under this subdivision, a copy of which shall have been presented to the secretary of state.
