I. A board of licensing for foresters is established to administer the provisions of this subdivision.  The board shall consist of 7 persons appointed by the governor and council, 4 of whom shall be foresters as defined in RSA 310-A:99, I, and 3 public members.  Of the forester members, one shall be the director, division of forests and lands, one shall be an industrial forester, one shall be a private forester, and one shall be a forester from the public sector.  A public member of the board shall be a person who is not, and never was, a member of the forestry profession or the spouse of any such person, and who does not have and never has had, a material financial interest in either the provision of forestry services or an activity directly related to forestry.  Two of the public members shall be forest landowners actively engaged in forest management, but not otherwise connected with the forestry profession.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each member of the board shall be a citizen of the United States and shall have been a resident of this state for at least 5 years prior to appointment.  Each forestry member shall have actively practiced forestry for at least 6 years prior to appointment and shall have held a responsible position in charge of such work for at least 2 years prior to appointment, which may include the teaching of forestry at a recognized college or university.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Members shall be appointed for 5-year terms, except that no more than one appointed member's term may expire in any one calendar year.  Appointments for terms of less than 5 years may be made in order to comply with this limitation.  No appointed member shall be eligible to serve more than 2 full consecutive terms, provided that for this purpose only a period actually served which exceeds  1/2 of the 5-year term shall be deemed a full term.  Upon expiration of a member's term, the member shall serve until a successor is qualified and appointed.  The successor's term shall be 5 years from the date of expiration of the predecessor's appointment, regardless of the date of the successor's appointment.  Vacancies occurring prior to the expiration of a specific term shall be filled by appointment for the unexpired term.  A board member may be removed for cause by the governor and council under RSA 4:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Members of the board shall be reimbursed for mileage at the state employee rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall hold at least 3 regular meetings each year and special meetings at such times as it may deem necessary.  Notice of all meetings shall be given in such a manner as rules adopted by the board may provide.  The board shall biennially elect or appoint a chairperson, vice-chairperson, and secretary.  Four members shall constitute a quorum.
