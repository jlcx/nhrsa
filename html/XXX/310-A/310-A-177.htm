&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 310-A:177 Surety Bond Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
There shall be filed with each original application for licensure a bond in the form of a surety, by a reputable company engaged in the bonding business, authorized to do business in the state, for the penal sum of $1,000 with one or more sureties, to be approved by the attorney general and conditioned that the applicant conform to and not violate any of the duties, terms, conditions, provisions, or requirements of this subdivision.  If any person shall be aggrieved by the misconduct of any such licensee, such person may maintain an action in his or her own name upon the bond of said licensee in any court having jurisdiction of the amount claimed.  All such claims shall be assignable, and the assignee shall be entitled to the same upon the bond of such licensee or otherwise, as the person aggrieved would have been entitled to if such claim had not been assigned.  Any claim or claims so assigned may be enforced in the name of such assignee.  Any remedies given by this subdivision shall not be exclusive of any other remedy which would otherwise exist.
