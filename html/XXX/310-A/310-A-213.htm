The board shall issue a license upon payment of the license fee established by the board, to any applicant who, in the opinion of the board, has satisfactorily met all the requirements of this subdivision.  Licenses shall show the full name of the license holder, have a serial number, and be signed by the chairperson or the secretary of the board.  The issuance of a license by the board shall be prima facie evidence that the person named in the license is entitled to all the rights and privileges of a certified septic system evaluator while the license remains valid.  It shall be a class B misdemeanor for the license holder to perform septic system evaluations after the license of the evaluator has expired or has been revoked, unless such license shall have been renewed, reinstated, or reissued.
