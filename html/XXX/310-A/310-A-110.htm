&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 310-A:110 Failure to Renew. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Failure to remit the biennial renewal fee when due or failure to submit proof of required continuing education shall automatically cancel the license.  If properly renewed, a license shall remain in effect continuously from the date of issuance, unless suspended or revoked by the board for just cause.  A person whose license is cancelled for such failure may reinstate such license by paying, within one year of cancellation, all fees due, plus a late fee as established by the board, provided continuing education requirements have been met.
