&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall issue a license upon payment of the required fee to any applicant who, in the opinion of the board, has satisfactorily met all the requirements for such license.  This license shall authorize the practice of land surveying.  The issuance of a license by the board shall be prima facie evidence that the licensee is entitled to all rights and privileges of a licensed land surveyor while the license remains valid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each licensee shall obtain a seal of the design authorized by the board, bearing the licensee's name, the legend "Licensed Land Surveyor'', and a place for the licensee's signature.  Plans, plats, and reports prepared by a licensee shall be stamped with the seal and signed by the licensee during the life of the license, but it shall be a class B misdemeanor for anyone to stamp or seal any document with a seal after expiration, suspension or revocation of a license, unless the license has been renewed or reissued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All plans and documents issued under a temporary certificate shall be stamped or otherwise noted to indicate the land surveyor's temporary certificate number and the beginning and ending date to the temporary certificate.  All such plans and documents shall be signed by the temporary certificate holder.
