<codesect>
The general court finds it in the best interests of the citizens of the state of New Hampshire to establish the board of natural scientists to certify and regulate the professions of soil scientists and wetland scientists.  This certification is to guard the citizens of New Hampshire and the professions from unqualified practitioners of soil science and wetland science and to foster intelligent application of the knowledge of soil properties and wetland characteristics in planning and implementing land use decisions consistent with New Hampshire department of environmental services rules or standards adopted by the board.
