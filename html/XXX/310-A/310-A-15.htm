<codesect>
The satisfactory completion of each year of an approved curriculum in engineering in a school or college approved by the board as of satisfactory standing, without graduation, shall be considered as equivalent to a year of experience under RSA 310-A:12, II and III.  Graduation in a curriculum other than engineering, but in a related field, from a college or university of recognized standing may be considered as equivalent to 2 years of experience under RSA 310-A:12, II and III;  provided, however, that no applicant shall receive credit for more than 4 years of experience because of undergraduate educational qualifications.  In counting years of experience, the board, at its discretion, may give credit not in excess of one year for satisfactory graduate study in engineering.
