&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The practice of or offer to practice professional engineering for others by individual engineers licensed under this subdivision through a business organization as officers, partners, associates, employees, or agents is permitted, subject to the provisions of this subdivision;  provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) One or more of the corporate officers, of a corporation or one or more general partners, or associates is designated as being responsible for the engineering activities and engineering decisions of the business organization, and is a licensed engineer under this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) All personnel of the business organization who act in its behalf as professional engineers are licensed under this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The business organization has been issued a certificate of authorization by the board, as provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The requirements of this subdivision shall not affect a business organization or its employees in performing services for such business organization or its subsidiary or affiliated business organizations.  All final drawings, specifications, plans, reports, or other engineering papers or documents involving the practice of engineering, when issued or filed for public record, shall be dated, and bear the signature and seal of the professional engineer who prepared them or under whose direct supervisory control they were prepared.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A business organization desiring a certificate of authorization shall file with the board an application, using a form provided by the board, listing the names and addresses of all officers and board members, general and limited partners, associates, and any individuals duly licensed to practice engineering in this state who shall be in responsible charge of the practice of engineering in this state through the business organization, and any other information required by the board.  The same form, giving the same information, must accompany the annual renewal fee.  If there is a change in any of these persons during the year, such change shall be designated on the same form and filed with the board within 30 days after the effective date of such change.  If all requirements of this section are met, the board shall issue a certificate of authorization to such business organization, and such business organization shall be authorized to contract for and to collect fees for furnishing engineering services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No business organization shall be relieved of responsibility for the conduct or acts of its agents, employees, officers, or partners, by reason of its compliance with the provisions of this section, nor shall any individual practicing engineering be relieved of responsibility for engineering services performed by reason of such individual's employment by or relationship with such business organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The secretary of state shall not issue a certificate of incorporation to an applicant for incorporation or for registration as a foreign business organization which includes the words "Engineer'' or "Engineering'' or any modification or derivative thereof in its corporate or business name or which includes the practice of engineering among the objects for which it is established unless the board shall have issued, with respect to such applicant, a certificate of authorization or eligibility for authorization, a copy of which shall have been presented to the secretary of state.  Similarly, the secretary of state, after a reasonable transition period, shall decline to register any trade name or service mark which includes such words or modifications or derivatives thereof in its firm or business name except to partnerships, sole proprietorships and associations holding certificates of registration or authorization issued under the provisions of this subdivision, a copy of which shall likewise have been presented to the secretary of state.  However, the requirements of this subdivision shall not apply to any business formed and registered with the secretary of state prior to January 1, 1999, which uses the words "Engineer'' or "Engineering'' or any modification or derivative thereof in its corporate or business name, and which does not perform or require the services of a professional engineer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A professional engineer who renders occasional, part-time or consulting engineering services to or for a business organization may not, for the purposes of this subdivision, be designated as being responsible for the engineering activities and decisions of such business organization.
