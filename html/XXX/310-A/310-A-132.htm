&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 310-A:132 License Expiration and Renewals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All licenses issued by the board shall expire on the last day of the licensee's month of birth the second year following the year of issuance, or upon such other biennial date as the board may adopt.  The board shall cause notification of the impending license expiration to be sent to each licensee at least one month prior to the expiration of the license, along with a request for payment of a renewal fee.  Licensees in good standing may renew their licenses by paying the renewal fee prior to the expiration date of the license, and by presenting evidence satisfactory to the board of completion of the continuing education requirements.  If properly renewed, a license shall remain in effect continuously from the date of issuance, unless suspended or revoked by the board for just cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Failure to remit the renewal fee when due shall automatically suspend the license.  A person whose license is canceled for such failure may reinstate the license by paying, within one year of suspension, all fees due, plus a late fee as established by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the renewal fee is not submitted within one year of the expiration date, an application for reinstatement shall be required and approved by the board to reinstate the license.
