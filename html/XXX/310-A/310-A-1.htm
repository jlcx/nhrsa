&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 310-A:1 Office of Professional Licensure and Certification;  Purpose.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of the office of professional licensure and certification is to promote efficiency and economy in the administration of the business processing, recordkeeping, and other administrative and clerical operations of professional licensing and certification boards, including both professional healthcare licensing and professional technical licensing.  The individual licensing and certification boards that are organized under the office of professional licensure and certification have specialized knowledge and experience and are separate and distinct for the purpose of regulating their various professions.  Notwithstanding the unique regulatory role of each board, the legislature finds that there are opportunities for improving efficiency and customer service by providing for the joint administration of the boards' administrative, clerical, business processing, and recordkeeping functions.  Except as provided in this section, the licensing and certification boards and entities organized under the office of professional licensure and certification shall exercise the powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities granted by statute.
