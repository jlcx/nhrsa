<codesect>
The board shall issue a license upon payment of the registration fee established by the board, to any applicant who, in the opinion of the board, has satisfactorily met all the requirements of this subdivision.  Licenses shall show the full name of the licensee, have a serial number, and be signed by the chairperson and the secretary of the board under seal of the board.  The issuance of a license by the board shall be prima facie evidence that the person named in the license is entitled to all the rights and privileges of a licensed architect while the license remains valid.  Each licensee shall upon licensure obtain a seal of the design authorized by the board, bearing the registrant's name and the legend, "Licensed Architect.''  All papers or documents involving the practice of a profession under this subdivision, when issued or filed for public record, shall be dated and bear the signature and seal of the licensed professional who prepared or had responsibility for and approved them.  It shall be a class B misdemeanor for the licensee to stamp or seal any documents with such seal after the license of the licensee has expired or has been revoked, unless such license shall have been renewed, reinstated, or reissued.
