I. The board shall take no disciplinary action without a hearing.  At least 14 days prior to hearing, both parties to a disciplinary proceeding shall be served, either personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, with a written copy of the complaint filed and notice of the time and place for hearing.  All complaints shall be objectively received and fairly heard by the board, but no complaint shall be acted upon unless in writing.  A hearing shall be held on all written complaints received by the board within one year of the date notice of a complaint was received by the accused, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.  Written notice of all disciplinary decisions made by the board shall be given to both parties to the proceeding upon their issuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, and also may require the production of books, papers and documents in a case involving the revocation of registration.  Any member of the board may administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses appearing before the board.  Any person failing or refusing to obey the subpoena or order of the board may be proceeded against in the same manner as for refusal to obey any other subpoena.
