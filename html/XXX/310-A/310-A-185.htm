I. The code of ethics details the core guidelines of home inspection professionalism and home inspection ethics, covering crucial issues such as conflicts of interest, good faith, and public perception.  Integrity, honesty, and objectivity are fundamental principles embodied by this code, which sets forth obligations of ethical conduct for the home inspection profession.

(a) Inspect properties for compensation in which they have, or expect to have, a financial interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Directly or indirectly compensate realty agents, or other parties having a financial interest in closing or settlement of real estate transactions, for the referral of inspections or for inclusion on a list of recommended inspectors, preferred providers, or similar arrangements.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Receive compensation for an inspection from more than one party unless agreed to by the client.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Repair, replace, or upgrade, for compensation, systems or components covered by the standards of practice, for one year after the inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Inspectors shall act in good faith toward each client and other interested parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Inspectors shall be objective in their reporting and not knowingly understate or overstate the significance of reported conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Inspectors shall not disclose inspection results or client information without client approval.  Inspectors, at their discretion, may disclose observed immediate safety hazards to occupants exposed to such hazards, when feasible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Inspectors shall avoid activities that may harm the public, discredit themselves, or reduce public confidence in the profession.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
