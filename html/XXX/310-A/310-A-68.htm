<codesect>
All licenses issued by the board shall expire on the last day of the month of the licensee's birth in the year 2 years following the year of issuance.  The secretary of the board shall notify every licensee of the date of the expiration of the license and the amount of the fee that shall be required for its renewal for 2 years.  Such notice shall be mailed at least one month in advance of the date of expiration.  Renewal may be effected at any time during the month of expiration by the payment of the fee established by the board and submission of evidence satisfactory to the board showing fulfillment of continuing education requirements.  The failure on the part of any licensee to renew the license in the month of expiration as required above shall not deprive such person of the right of renewal, provided that the board shall charge a 20 percent reinstatement fee for each month or fraction of a month the renewal is late.  If a licensee fails to renew such license within the 12 months after the date of expiration, it shall become null and void and the licensee shall be required to reapply and to be reexamined for licensure as required in this section.
