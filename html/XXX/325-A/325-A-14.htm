I. If the license of a crematory authority has lapsed for nonpayment of fees, such license shall be eligible for reinstatement at any time upon application to the board and payment of the applicable fee as provided in RSA 325-A:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the license of a crematory authority has been placed on probation, such license shall be eligible for reinstatement at the end of the period of probation upon successful completion of an inspection if the board determines an inspection is warranted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the license of a crematory authority has been suspended, such license shall be eligible for reinstatement at the end of the period of suspension upon successful completion of an inspection and payment of the applicable fee as provided in RSA 325-A:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the license of a crematory authority has been suspended, such license may be reinstated by the board prior to the completion of the term of suspension upon petition by the licensee.  After reviewing such petition and any material submitted by the licensee with such petition, the board may order an inspection or investigation of the licensee.  Based on such review and such inspection or investigation, if any, the board shall grant full reinstatement of the license, modify the suspension, or deny the petition for reinstatement.  The board's decision shall become final 30 days after mailing the decision to the licensee unless the licensee requests a hearing within such period.  Any requested hearing shall be held according to rules of the board.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the license of a crematory authority has been revoked, such crematory authority shall not be eligible for relicensure until 5 years after the date of such revocation.  A reapplication for an initial license may be made by the crematory authority at the end of such 5-year period.
