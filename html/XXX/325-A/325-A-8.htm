<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall at least once every 3 years inspect or provide for the inspection of any crematory operated by a crematory authority licensed under this chapter in such manner and at such times as provided in rules adopted by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall issue an inspection report and provide a copy of the report to the crematory authority within 10 working days after the completion of an inspection.  The board shall review any findings of noncompliance contained in such report within 20 working days after such inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the board determines, after such review, that the evidence supports a finding of noncompliance by a crematory authority with any applicable provisions of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, the board may send a letter to the crematory authority requesting a statement of compliance.  The letter shall include a description of each alleged violation, a request that the crematory authority submit a statement of compliance within 10 working days, and a notice that the board may take further action if the statement of compliance is not submitted.  The statement of compliance shall indicate any actions by the crematory authority which have been or will be taken and the period of time estimated to be necessary to correct each alleged violation.  If the crematory authority fails to submit such statement of compliance or fails to make a good faith effort to correct the alleged violations, the board may take further action as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The board may appoint technical advisors or other investigators to assist with any investigation or adjudication, and may, with the approval of the attorney general, appoint legal counsel for such purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To the extent the board lacks budgeted funds to conduct a significant investigation or adjudication, it may, with the approval of the attorney general, petition governor and council to receive funds not otherwise appropriated in order to retain professional advisors in the proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the governor and council approve the use of funds not otherwise appropriated, the governor is authorized to issue a warrant for the approved amount out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.  The board shall then promptly increase its licensing fees to the extent necessary to repay the amount advanced to the general fund during the next fiscal year by means of a fee surcharge.
