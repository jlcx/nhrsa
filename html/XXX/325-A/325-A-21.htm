<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A crematory authority shall not accept human remains for cremation without a proper label placed on the exterior of the alternative container or casket indicating the name of the deceased and the name and location of the funeral establishment, or the name of the next-of-kin or designated agent as provided in RSA 290.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No crematory authority shall make or enforce any rules requiring that human remains be placed in a casket before cremation or that human remains be cremated in a casket.  No crematory authority shall refuse to accept human remains for cremation if the human remains are not in a casket.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III.

Human remains delivered to a crematory in an alternative container shall not be removed from the alternative container, and the alternative container shall be cremated with the human remains.  A crematory authority may refuse a noncombustible casket or any other container that is not an alternative container or a casket or container that is not labeled as required under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
