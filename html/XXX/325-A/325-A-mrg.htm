&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 325-A:24 Potentially Hazardous Conditions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No human remains shall be cremated with the knowledge that the human remains contain a pacemaker or defibrillator or other potentially hazardous implant or condition.  The authorizing agent shall take all necessary steps to ensure that any such hazardous implant or condition is removed or corrected prior to cremation.  If an authorizing agent informs the funeral director and the crematory authority on the cremation authorization form of the presence of such potentially hazardous implant or condition in the human remains, the funeral director shall ensure that all necessary steps have been taken to remove or correct the implant or condition before delivering the human remains to the crematory.  A funeral director who knowingly fails to ensure the removal or correction of the hazardous implant or condition prior to delivery and who knowingly delivers such human remains shall be liable for any damages resulting from such failure.  If human remains with hazardous implants or conditions are in the custody of a crematory authority, such authority shall have the hazardous implants or conditions removed or corrected by a licensed funeral director and embalmer or a licensed embalmer at a funeral establishment within an embalming preparation room, or at a medical facility by appropriate medical personnel, or at the crematory by an assistant deputy medical examiner of the department of justice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No human remains shall be cremated with the knowledge that the human remains contain jewelry or other valuables unless authorized by the authorizing agent.  The authorizing agent shall take all necessary steps to ensure that any jewelry or other valuables are removed prior to cremation.  If the authorizing agent informs the funeral director and the crematory authority on the cremation authorization form of the presence of jewelry or other valuables on the human remains, the funeral director shall ensure that all necessary steps have been taken to remove the jewelry or other valuables before delivering the human remains to the crematory.  A funeral director who knowingly fails to ensure the removal of the jewelry or other valuables prior to delivery and who knowingly delivers such human remains shall be liable for any damages resulting from such failure.  If human remains with jewelry or other valuables are in the custody of a crematory authority, such authority shall provide for the removal of such jewelry or other valuables by a licensed funeral director and embalmer or his or her agent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 325-A:25 Disputes. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a crematory authority or funeral establishment is aware of any dispute concerning the cremation of human remains, or has a reasonable basis to believe that such a dispute exists or to question any of the representations made by the authorizing agent with respect to such remains, until the crematory authority receives a court order that a dispute with respect to such remains has been settled, the crematory authority or funeral establishment may refuse to accept such human remains for cremation or to perform a cremation of such remains.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a crematory authority or funeral establishment is aware of any dispute concerning the release or disposition of cremated remains, the crematory authority or funeral establishment may refuse to release cremated remains until the dispute has been resolved or the crematory authority or funeral establishment has been provided with a court order authorizing the release or disposition of the cremated remains.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 325-A:26 Cremated Remains;  How Treated. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Insofar as is possible, upon completion of the cremation, all of the recoverable residue of the cremation shall be removed from the cremation chamber and any foreign matter or anything other than bone fragments shall be removed from such residue and shall be disposed of by the crematory authority.  The remaining bone fragments shall be processed by pulverization so as to reduce the fragments to unidentifiable particles.  This paragraph shall not apply when the commingling of human remains during cremation is otherwise authorized by law.  The presence of incidental and unavoidable residue in the cremation chamber from a prior cremation is not a violation of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The cremated remains with proper identification shall be placed in a temporary container or permanent container selected or provided by the authorizing agent.  The cremated remains shall not be contaminated with any other object unless specific written authorization to the contrary has been received from the authorizing agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the entirety of the cremated remains will not fit within a temporary container or permanent container, then the remainder of such remains shall be returned to the authorizing agent or his or her representative in a separate container with proper identification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the cremated remains are to be shipped, the temporary container or permanent container shall be packed securely in a suitable shipping container that complies with the requirements of the shipper.  Unless otherwise directed in writing by the authorizing agent, cremated remains shall be shipped only by a method which includes an internal tracking system and which provides a receipt signed by the person accepting delivery of such remains.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 325-A:27 Cremated Remains;  Final Disposition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For purposes of this chapter, the delivery of the cremated remains to the authorizing agent or his or her representative shall constitute final disposition.  If, after a period of 60 days after the date of cremation, the authorizing agent or his or her representative has not directed or otherwise arranged for the final disposition of the cremated remains or claimed the cremated remains for final disposition as provided in this section, the crematory authority or the funeral establishment in possession of the cremated remains may dispose of the cremated remains after making a reasonable attempt to contact the authorizing agent or his or her representative.  This method of disposition may be used by any crematory authority or funeral establishment to dispose of all cremated remains in the possession of a crematory authority or funeral establishment on or after the effective date of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Cremated remains shall be delivered or released by the crematory authority to the representative specified by the authorizing agent on the cremation authorization form.  The owner of the crematory authority or his or her representative and the party receiving the cremated remains shall sign a cremated remains receipt form.  The form shall include the name of the deceased, the date, time, and place of receipt of the cremated remains, and the signatures of the owner of the crematory or his or her representative and the authorizing agent or his or her representative.  If the cremated remains are shipped, a form used by the shipper may be used in lieu of a completed cremated remains receipt form if the shipper's form contains the information required for a cremated remains receipt form.  Both the party delivering such remains and the party receiving such remains shall retain a copy of the cremated remains receipt form or shipper's form.  Upon delivery, the cremated remains may be further transported within this state in any manner without a permit.
