&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 330-A:20 Provisional Clinical Mental Health Counselor License. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall issue a provisional clinical mental health counselor license to any person who has at least 5 years demonstrated clinical mental health experience and has a master's degree with a concentration in the field of counseling or psychology from a regionally accredited institution, but who may not meet all of the requirements of RSA 330-A:19.  This provisional license shall expire on July 1, 2001 unless the provisional licensee successfully completes the remainder of the 60 hours of graduate credit in RSA 330-A:19, I, and passes the clinical mental health counselor's examination of the National Board for Certified Counselors, Inc., if permitted by such board to take the examination.  If the provisional licensee successfully completes the 60 hours of graduate credit and is not allowed by the National Board for Certified Counselors, Inc. to take the examination, then the provisional licensee shall be granted a clinical mental health counselor license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In reviewing the licensure applications of those persons granted a provisional license under paragraph I, the board shall consider appropriate continuing education credits in psychology or closely related fields as a portion of the additional graduate credit hours needed in RSA 330-A:19, I.
