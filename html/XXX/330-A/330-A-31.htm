I. Licenses shall be valid for a period of 2 years and shall become invalid on the expiration date unless renewed.  It shall be the duty of the board to notify every person licensed by the board under this chapter of the date of expiration of the license and the amount of the fee that shall be required for its renewal for 2 years.  Such notice shall be mailed at least 2 months in advance of the date of expiration of such license.  Renewal shall be conditional upon filing a timely and complete renewal application and payment of the fee as set by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a license is not renewed it may be retroactively reinstated not later than 6 months after the date of license expiration upon payment of the fee and compliance with rules adopted by the board.  A license may be placed on inactive status pursuant to rules adopted by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the request of a person licensed by the board who is a member of any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States or the national guard and is called to active duty, the board shall place such person's license on inactive status.  The license may be reactivated, after notification to the board, within one year of the person's release from active status by payment of the renewal fee and with proof of completion of the most current continuing education requirement unless still within the renewal period.
