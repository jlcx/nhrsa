&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 332-J:5 Issuance, Denial, or Renewal of Certificate of Registration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the secretary of state shall issue a certificate of registration to an individual who complies with RSA 332-J:4, I, or whose application has been accepted under RSA 332-J:4, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The secretary of state may refuse to issue a certificate of registration if the secretary of state determines that the applicant has engaged in conduct that has a significant adverse effect on the applicant's fitness to act as an athlete agent.  In making the determination, the secretary of state may consider whether the applicant has:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Been convicted of a crime that, if committed in this state, would be a crime involving moral turpitude or a felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Made a materially false, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent representation in the application or as an athlete agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Engaged in conduct that would disqualify the applicant from serving in a fiduciary capacity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Engaged in conduct prohibited by RSA 332-J:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Had a registration or licensure as an athlete agent suspended, revoked, or denied or been refused renewal of registration or licensure as an athlete agent in any state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Engaged in conduct the consequence of which was that a sanction, suspension, or declaration of ineligibility to participate in an interscholastic or intercollegiate athletic event was imposed on a student-athlete or educational institution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Engaged in conduct that significantly adversely reflects on the applicant's credibility, honesty, or integrity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In making a determination under paragraph II, the secretary of state shall consider:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) How recently the conduct occurred;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The nature of the conduct and the context in which it occurred;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any other relevant conduct of the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An athlete agent may apply to renew a registration by submitting an application for renewal in a form prescribed by the secretary of state.  A renewal application filed under this section shall be a public record for the purposes of RSA 91-A.  The application for renewal shall be signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury and shall contain current information on all matters required in an original registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An individual who has submitted an application for renewal of registration or evidence of licensure in another state in lieu of submitting an application for renewal in the form prescribed pursuant to paragraph IV, may file a copy of the application for renewal and a valid certificate of registration or licensure from the other state.  The secretary of state shall accept the application for renewal from the other state as an application for renewal in this state if the application to the other state:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Was submitted in the other state within 6 months next preceding the filing in this state and the applicant certifies the information contained in the application for renewal is current;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Contains information substantially similar to or more comprehensive than that required in an application for renewal submitted in this state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Was signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A certificate of registration or a renewal of a registration shall be valid for 2 years.
