<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a license is not renewed before the expiration date, then the license is deemed to have expired, and a licensee may renew an expired license up to 6 months after its expiration date by complying with the requirements of RSA 310-B:13 and by submitting the required late fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an expired license is not renewed within 6 months under paragraph I, then the license is deemed to have lapsed and such person may obtain a license only by qualifying anew as an original applicant.  However, the board may renew a lapsed license for good cause shown within a reasonable time not to exceed one year from the date of expiration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a license expires or lapses as a result of a person being ordered to active duty with the armed forces, the 6-month time period for complying with the requirement of RSA 310-B:13 shall begin upon the licensee's date of discharge or release from active duty, and the late fee shall be waived.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The rights of the licensee under such expired or lapsed license shall be terminated.  It shall be unlawful to act or attempt or offer to act in any matter as a real estate appraiser apprentice completing the requirements for licensure or certification, or as a licensed or certified appraiser, under an expired or lapsed license.
