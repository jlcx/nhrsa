&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As a prerequisite to renewal of licensure or certification, a licensed or certified real estate appraiser shall present evidence satisfactory to the board of having met the continuing education requirements for this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The basic continuing education requirement for renewal of licensure or certification shall be the completion by the applicant, during the immediately preceding term of licensure or certification, of those courses and programs required by the board by rules adopted under RSA 541-A.  In adopting such rules, the board shall base its requirements on the criteria established by the Appraisal Qualifications Board of the Appraisal Foundation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In lieu of meeting the requirements of paragraph II, an applicant for relicensing or recertification may satisfy all or part of the requirements by presenting evidence of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Completion of an educational program of study determined by the board to be equivalent, for continuing educations purposes, to courses approved by the board under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Participation other than as a student in educational processes and programs approved by the board which relate to real property appraisal theory, practices or techniques, including, but not necessarily limited to, teaching, program development and preparation of textbooks, monographs, articles, and other instructional materials.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board shall give favorable consideration to courses of instruction, seminars, and other real property appraisal educational courses or programs previously or hereafter developed by or under the auspices of professional appraisal organizations or other approved educational resources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No amendment or repeal of a rule adopted by the board relative to this section shall operate to deprive a licensed or certified real estate appraiser of credit toward renewal of licensure or certification for any course of instruction completed by the applicant prior to the amendment or repeal of the rule which would have qualified for continuing education credit under the rule as it existed prior to the repeal or amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Licensure or certification as a licensed or certified real estate appraiser that has been revoked as a result of disciplinary action by the board shall not be reinstated unless the applicant presents evidence of completion of the continuing education required by this chapter.  This requirement of evidence of continuing education shall not be imposed upon an applicant for reinstatement who has been required to successfully complete the examination for licensed or certified real estate appraiser as a condition to reinstatement of licensure or certification.
