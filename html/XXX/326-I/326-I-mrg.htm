&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 326-I:1 Findings and Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that while there is no census count, as many as 10,000 New Hampshire citizens live with hearing loss;  that of this number perhaps 3,000 men, women, and children are unable to readily understand speech due to the extent of their hearing loss, but instead rely on a visual mode of communication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court finds that a significant number of New Hampshire's deaf and hard of hearing, its broad array of public agencies and institutions, and its medical and legal professions share a unique challenge:  the necessity to hire professional interpreters licensed to provide ready and reliable communications to and for those who use a visual mode of communication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The general court further finds the mandates of federal and state statutes which require funding of interpreter's services, by the same public agencies and institutions, medical and legal professions, and others of those interpreters requested by the deaf and hard of hearing, is a mandate in itself to the legislature to ensure the availability of a skilled cadre of professional, licensed interpreters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The purpose of this legislation is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To provide standards for the licensing and regulation of interpreters for the deaf and hard of hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To ensure interpreters for the deaf and hard of hearing meet rigorous standards, and that by power of revoking their licenses are held accountable for the quality and timeliness of their work.
