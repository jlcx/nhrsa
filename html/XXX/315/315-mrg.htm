<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may investigate possible misconduct by licensees and any other matters governed by the provisions of this chapter.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may appoint legal counsel, podiatric advisors or other investigators to assist with any investigation and with adjudicatory hearings.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A minimum of 48 hours' notice shall be given for compliance with a subpoena issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board may at any time subpoena podiatric records from its licensees and patient records from hospitals, pharmacies and other health care providers or facilities licensed by or certified in this state.

The licensee shall provide complete copies of his office records concerning any patient identified in the complaint.  The licensee shall respond to such request within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days, as the board may specify in its written request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any person may file a written complaint with the board which charges that a person licensed by the board has committed misconduct.  The board may hold preliminary hearings to facilitate the informal disposition of complaints which, during the preliminary hearing, are found to be unwarranted or unjustified.  The board shall follow the provisions of RSA 541-A:31, V in conducting such hearings.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If an investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee without the consent of a complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute and the complainant is given an opportunity to comment upon the terms of the proposed settlement.
