&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall meet quarterly, or more often as its business requires.  A president and such other officers as the board deems necessary shall be elected annually from the membership of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No board action shall be taken without an affirmative vote of the majority of board members eligible to participate in the matter in question.  A board member shall not be eligible to participate in a vote when the board member has recused himself or herself from participation due to a conflict of interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The president of the board may call an emergency meeting when required by an imminent peril to the public health or safety or when the physical presence of a quorum is not reasonably practical for immediate board action.  Emergency meetings may be conducted telephonically, with a quorum of board members eligible to vote with respect to the subject matter of the emergency.  Any vote resulting from such meetings shall have the same effect as votes resulting from other meetings of the board, if such vote is ratified at the next regularly scheduled board meeting.  The minutes and the procedures for emergency meetings shall comply with RSA 91-A:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Elected board officers shall not serve more than 5 years in such elected positions.
