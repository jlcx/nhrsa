&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every person licensed to practice under this chapter shall apply to the board biennially on or before June 30 for renewal of license on forms provided by the board and shall pay a $300 renewal fee.  As a condition of renewal of license, each licensee shall show proof of having completed the continuing education units as required in rules adopted by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a person applies to the board for renewal of license by June 30 of the year in which the licensee's renewal is set to occur, the license shall not expire until the board has taken final action on the application for renewal.  At least 20 days prior to the expiration of any license, the board shall cause a notice to be mailed to the licensee advising him or her of the expiration date and enclosing a blank renewal application form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the request of a person licensed by the board who is a member of any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States or the national guard and is called to active duty, the board shall place such person's license on inactive status.  The license may be reactivated, after notification to the board, within one year of the person's release from active status by payment of the renewal fee and with proof of completion of the most current continuing education requirement unless still within the renewal period.
