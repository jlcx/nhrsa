&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 315:10-a Hearings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any complaint not resolved at or prior to a preliminary hearing shall be heard by the board.  Such hearing shall be an open public hearing.  Any member of the board shall have the authority to preside at such a hearing and to issue oaths or affirmations to witnesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall furnish the respondent and the complainant, if any, at least 15 days' written notice of the date, time and place of a hearing, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  Such notice shall include an itemization of the issues to be heard, and, in the case of a disciplinary hearing, a statement as to whether the action had been initiated by a written complaint or upon the board's own motion, or both.  If a written complaint is involved, the notice shall provide the complainant with a reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may at any time dispose of allegations in a complaint, investigation, or disciplinary hearing by settlement, default, or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for failing to state a proper basis for disciplinary action or by summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts.  In disciplinary hearings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but all final disciplinary actions, including those which occur without holding a public hearing, shall be publicly released at the time they are served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every final disciplinary action and other adjudicatory decisions made final by the board shall be reduced to writing and served upon the parties.  Such decisions shall not be public until they are served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Decisions of the board may be appealed to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541.  The court shall not stay any disciplinary sanction imposed by the board pending appeal, if the board has determined that the sanction is required for the public safety and welfare.
