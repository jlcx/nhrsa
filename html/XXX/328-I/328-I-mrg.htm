&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board may issue a non-disciplinary confidential letter of concern to a registrant advising that, the board believes the medical technician should modify or eliminate certain practices, and that continuation of the activities which led to the information being submitted to the board may result in action against the registrant's registration.  This letter shall not be released to the public or any other licensing authority, except that the letter may be used as evidence in subsequent disciplinary proceedings by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Disciplinary or non-disciplinary remedial action taken by the board under this section may be appealed to the supreme court under RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. No civil action shall be maintained against the board or any member of the board or its agents or employees with regard to any action or activity taken in the performance of any duty or authority established by this chapter.  No civil action shall be maintained against any organization or its members or against any other person for or by reason of any good faith statement, report, communication, or testimony to the board or determination by the board in relation to proceedings under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The board shall send all notices of hearing, and notices of suspension or revocation of registration to the department of health and human services and the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Allegations of professional misconduct or other violations of this chapter enforceable by the board shall be brought within 6 years from the time the board could reasonably have discovered the act, omission, or failure complained of, except that conduct which resulted in a criminal conviction or in a disciplinary action by a relevant licensing authority in another jurisdiction may be considered by the board without time limitation in making registration or disciplinary decisions if the conduct would otherwise be a ground for discipline under this chapter.  The board may also consider registrant conduct without time limitation when the ultimate issue before the board involves a pattern of conduct or the cumulative effect of conduct which becomes apparent as a result of conduct which has occurred within the 6-year limitation period prescribed by this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. When an investigation of a complaint against a registrant is determined to be unfounded, the board shall dismiss the complaint and explain in writing to the complainant and the registrant its reason for dismissing the complaint.  The board shall destroy all information collected during the course of the investigation after 6 years.  The board shall retain a record only noting that an investigation was conducted and that the board determined the complaint to be unfounded.  For the purpose of this paragraph, a complaint shall be deemed to be unfounded if it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the board, does not relate to the actions of the registrant, or is determined by the board to be frivolous.

For any order issued in resolution of a disciplinary proceeding by the board, where the board has found misconduct sufficient to support disciplinary action, including but not limited to a violation of this chapter or an administrative rule adopted under this chapter, the board may require the registrant who is the subject of such finding to pay the board a sum not to exceed the reasonable cost of investigation and prosecution of the proceeding.  This sum shall not exceed $5,000.  This sum may be imposed in addition to any otherwise authorized administrative fines levied by the board as part of the penalty.
