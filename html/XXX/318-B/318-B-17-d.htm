<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Persons claiming an interest in the property may file petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture or file a claim and post bond with the department of justice within 30 days of the first notice by publication or 30 days from the receipt of written notice, whichever is later.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The department of justice shall provide the seizing agency and the petitioner a written decision on each petition for remission or mitigation within 60 days of receipt of such petition unless the circumstances of the case require additional time in which case the department of justice shall notify the petitioner in writing and with specificity within the 60-day period that the circumstances of the case require additional time, and further notify the petitioner of the expected decision date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

A sworn affidavit of indigency may be filed in lieu of a cost bond.  Upon receipt of the claim and bond, or, if department of justice otherwise so elects, the department shall file with the court a petition in rem to order forfeiture of items or property interests subject to forfeiture under the provisions of this section.  All judicial proceedings thereafter shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of RSA 318-B:17-b, IV.  Any bonds received by the department of justice shall be held by him pending final disposition of the case.
