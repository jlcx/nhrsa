&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the request of the attorney general, a county attorney or any law enforcement agency, the laboratory employee performing the chemical analysis shall prepare a certificate.  The employee shall sign the certificate under oath and shall include in the certificate an attestation as to the result of the analysis.  The presentation of this certificate to a court by any party to a proceeding shall be evidence that all of the requirements and provisions of this section have been complied with.  This certificate shall be sworn to before a notary public or other person empowered by law to take oaths and shall contain a statement establishing the following:  the type of analysis performed;  the result achieved;  any conclusions reached based upon that result;  that the subscriber is the person who performed the analysis and made the conclusions;  the subscriber's training or experience to perform the analysis;  and the nature and condition of the equipment used.  When properly executed, the certificate shall, subject to paragraph II of this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law, be admissible evidence of the composition, quality, and quantity of the substance submitted to the laboratory for analysis, and the court shall take judicial notice of the signature of the person performing the analysis and of the fact that he is that person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever a party intends to proffer in a criminal proceeding a certificate executed pursuant to this section, notice of an intent to proffer that certificate and all reports relating to the analysis in question, including a copy of the certificate, shall be conveyed to the opposing party or parties at least 25 days before the proceeding begins.  An opposing party who intends to object to the admission into evidence of a certificate shall give notice of objection and the specific grounds for the objection within 10 days upon receiving the adversary's notice of intent to proffer the certificate.  Whenever a notice of objection is filed, admissibility of the certificate shall be determined not later than 10 days before the beginning of the trial.  A proffered certificate shall be admitted in evidence unless it appears from the notice of objection and specific grounds for that objection that the composition, quality, or quantity of the substance submitted to the laboratory for analysis will be contested at trial.  A failure to comply with the time limitations regarding the notice of objection required by this section shall constitute a waiver of any objection to the admission of the certificate.  The time limitations set forth in this section shall not be relaxed except upon a showing of good cause.
