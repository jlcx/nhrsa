For purposes of this section, the person's act of manufacturing, dispensing, or selling a substance is the cause of a death when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The injection, inhalation or ingestion of the substance is an antecedent but for which the death would not have occurred;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The death was not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Too remote in its occurrence as to have just bearing on the person's liability;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Too dependent upon conduct of another person which was unrelated to the injection, inhalation or ingestion of the substance or its effect, as to have a just bearing on the person's liability.  It shall not be a defense to a prosecution under this section that the decedent contributed to his own death by his purposeful, knowing, reckless or negligent injection, inhalation or ingestion of the substance or by his consenting to the administration of the substance by another.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude or limit any prosecution for homicide.  A conviction arising under this section shall not merge with a conviction of one as a drug enterprise leader or for any other offense defined in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX-a. A qualifying patient or designated caregiver as defined in RSA 126-X:1 who sells cannabis to a person who is not a qualifying patient or a designated caregiver shall be guilty of a class B felony and shall be sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of not more than 7 years, a fine of not more than $300,000, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Any penalty imposed for violation of this chapter shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any civil or administrative penalty or sanction authorized by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Any person who violates any provision of this chapter for which a penalty is not provided by paragraphs I through IX shall be guilty of a class B felony if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The penalty categories set forth in this section based upon the weight of the drug involved are material elements of the offense;  however, the culpability requirement shall not apply to that element of the offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be fined a minimum of $350 for a first offense and $500 for a second or subsequent offense, except that any person who violates the provisions of RSA 318-B:26, II(d) or RSA 318-B:26, II(e) shall be fined $350.
