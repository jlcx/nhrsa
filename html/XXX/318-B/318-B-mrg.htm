<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Actual or relative potential for abuse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) State of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) History and current pattern of abuse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Scope, duration, and significance of abuse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Risk to the public health;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Potential of the substance to produce psychic or physical dependence liability;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After considering the factors in paragraph I, the commissioner shall make findings relative to the substance and adopt a rule controlling the substance if he finds the substance has a potential for abuse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition to the provisions of RSA 541-A, the commissioner shall give due notice of the time, place and purpose of all hearings required under this chapter to podiatrists, osteopaths, hospitals, pharmacists, physicians, dentists, veterinarians, advanced registered nurse practitioners, optometrists, laboratories, registered manufacturers, suppliers and to the general public by such means as he shall deem adequate.  From and after the hearing date, the sale or dispensation (except by prescription) of a drug or chemical containing any quantity of such substance as is the subject matter of the hearing shall be suspended pending a determination as to whether such substance is to be designated as a controlled drug.  Designation as a controlled drug shall result in the continued suspension of the sale or dispensation (except by prescription) of any drug or chemical containing any quantity of such substance until the effective date of the designation.  The substance shall thereafter be a controlled drug subject to this chapter.  If any substance is so designated, the commissioner shall publish the designation in a newspaper of general circulation in the state once each week for 3 successive weeks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Substances which are precursors of the controlled precursor shall not be subject to control solely because they are precursors of the controlled precursor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If any substance is designated, rescheduled, or deleted as a controlled substance under federal law and notice thereof is given to the commissioner, the commissioner shall similarly control the substance under this chapter after the expiration of 30 days from publication in the Federal Register of a final order designating a substance as a controlled substance or rescheduling or deleting a substance, unless, within that 30 day period, the commissioner objects to inclusion, rescheduling, or deletion.  In that case, the commissioner shall publish the reasons for objection and afford all interested persons an opportunity to be heard.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the commissioner shall publish his decision, which shall be final unless altered by law.  Upon publication of objection to inclusion, rescheduling, or deletion under this chapter by the commissioner, control under this chapter shall be stayed until the commissioner publishes his decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Authority to control under this section shall not extend to distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, or tobacco.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Controlled drugs shall be scheduled by whatever official, common, usual, chemical or trade name designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner shall revise and republish the schedules in RSA 318-B:1-b semi-annually for 2 years from the effective date of this section, and thereafter annually.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 318-B:1-c Flunitrazepam. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislature intends that the provisions of paragraph III of this section shall remain in effect until such time as flunitrazepam is scheduled by the commissioner of the department of human services in accordance with and pursuant to RSA 318-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislature finds that flunitrazepam, marketed under the trade name rohypnol, which has a sedative, hypnotic, and amnesiac effect, has no acceptable medical uses in the United States and carries a high potential for abuse.  Therefore, flunitrazepam meets the criteria for placement on schedule I of controlled drugs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 318-B:1-a, relative to scheduling by rulemaking of the commissioner of the department of health and human services, flunitrazepam shall be scheduled as a schedule I controlled drug.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Not Dependence Forming or of Sustaining Character.  The department of health and human services may by rule exempt from the application of this chapter, to such extent as it determines to be consistent with the public welfare, pharmaceutical preparations found by the department of health and human services after due notice and hearing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Either to possess no physiological or psychological dependence forming or sustaining character, or to possess physiological or psychological dependence forming or sustaining character not sufficient to warrant imposition of all the requirements of this chapter, and,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Not to permit recovery of the minute quantity of a controlled drug from the pharmaceutical preparation having such a physiological or psychological dependence forming or sustaining character, with such relative technical chemical separation simplicity and degree of quantitative yield as to create a risk of improper use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Exempt Under Federal Law.  In exercising the authority granted in paragraph I, the commissioner of the department of health and human services by rule and without special findings, may grant exempt status to such pharmaceutical preparations as are or may be determined to be exempt under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and regulations and permit the administering, dispensing, or selling of such preparations under the same conditions as permitted by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and regulations and the federal food and drug laws and regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Revocation.  If the department of health and human services shall find after due notice and a hearing, as required by RSA 318-B:1, VI, that any exempt pharmaceutical preparation does possess a degree of physiological or psychological dependence character that results in material abusive use, it shall by designation publish, once each week for 3 successive weeks, the findings in a newspaper of general circulation in the state.  The findings shall be effective, and the exempt status shall cease to apply to such pharmaceutical preparation, 7 days after the date of the publication of the findings.  The suspension procedure specified in RSA 318-B:1, VI, shall also apply to such exempt preparation after the hearing date.

The court may issue a seizure warrant on an affidavit under oath demonstrating that probable cause exists for its forfeiture or that the property has been the subject of a previous final judgment of forfeiture in the courts of any state or of the United States.  The application for process and the issuance, execution and return of process shall be subject to applicable state law.  The court may order that the property be seized and secured on such terms and conditions as are reasonable in the discretion of the court.  Such order may include an order to a financial institution or to any fiduciary or bailee to require the entity to impound any property in its possession or control and not to release it except upon further order of the court.  The order may be made on or in connection with a search warrant;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Physically, without process on probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture under this chapter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Constructively, without process on probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture under this chapter, by recording a notice of pending forfeiture in the registry of deeds in the county where the real property is located or at the town clerk's office where the personal property is located stating that the state intends to seek forfeiture of the identified property pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A seizure for forfeiture without process under subparagraph (b) or (c) is reasonable if made under circumstances in which a warrantless seizure or arrest would be valid in accordance with state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-c. Upon seizure of any items or property interests the property shall not be subject to alienation, sequestration or attachment but is deemed to be in the custody of the department of justice subject only to the order of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Upon the seizure of any personal property under paragraph I, the person making or directing such seizure shall inventory the items or property interests and issue a copy of the resulting report to any person or persons having a recorded interest, or claiming an equitable interest in the item within 7 days of said seizure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon seizure of any real property under paragraph I, the person making or directing such seizure shall notify any person having a recorded interest or claiming an equitable interest in the property within 7 days of said seizure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The seizing agency shall cause an appraisal to be made of the property as soon as possible and shall promptly send to the department of justice a written request for forfeiture.  This request shall include a statement of all facts and circumstances supporting forfeiture of the property, including the names of all witnesses then known, and the appraised value of the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The department of justice shall examine the facts and applicable law of the cases referred pursuant to subparagraph (c), and if it is probable that the property is subject to forfeiture, shall cause the initiation of administrative or judicial proceedings against the property.  If upon inquiry and examination, the department of justice determines that such proceedings probably cannot be sustained or that the ends of justice do not require the institution of such proceedings, the department shall make a written report of such findings and send a copy to the seizing agency, and, if appropriate, shall also authorize and direct the release of the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The department of justice shall, within 60 days of the seizure, either file a petition in the superior court having jurisdiction under this section or seek administrative forfeiture pursuant to RSA 318-B:17-d.  If no such petition is filed or administrative procedure initiated within 60 days, the items or property interest seized shall be released or returned to the owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Pending forfeiture and final disposition, the law enforcement agency making the seizure shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Place the property under seal;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Remove the property to a storage area for safekeeping;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Remove the property to a place designated by the court;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Request another agency to take custody of the property and remove it to an appropriate location within the state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In the case of moneys, file a motion for transfer of evidence under RSA 595-A:6.  Upon the court's granting of the motion the moneys shall be immediately forwarded to an interest-bearing seized asset escrow account to be administered by the attorney general.  Upon resolution of the forfeiture proceeding the moneys deposited shall be transferred to the drug forfeiture fund or returned to the owners thereof as directed by the court.  Unless otherwise ordered by a court in a specific case, interest on all moneys deposited in the seized asset escrow account shall be deposited annually into the drug forfeiture fund established under RSA 318-B:17-c.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The court may order forfeiture of all items or property interests subject to the provisions of paragraph I, except as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No item or property interest shall be subject to forfeiture unless the owner or owners thereof were consenting parties to a felonious violation of this chapter and had knowledge thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No items or property interests shall be subject to forfeiture unless involved in an offense which may be charged as a felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The department of justice may petition the superior court in the name of the state in the nature of a proceeding in rem to order forfeiture of items or property interests subject to forfeiture under the provisions of this section.  Such petition shall be filed in the court having jurisdiction over any related criminal proceedings which could be brought under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such proceeding shall be deemed a civil suit in equity in which the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by a preponderance of the evidence and in which the owners or other persons claiming an exception pursuant to paragraph III shall have the burden of proving such exception.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The court shall issue summonses to all persons who have a recorded interest or claim an equitable interest in said items or property interests seized under this chapter and shall schedule a hearing on the petition to be held within 90 days of the date specified by the court on the summonses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) At the request of any party to the forfeiture proceeding, the court may grant a continuance until the final resolution of any criminal proceedings which were brought against a party under this chapter and which arose from the transaction which gave rise to the forfeiture proceeding.  No asset forfeiture may be maintained against a person's interest in property if that person has been found not guilty of the underlying felonious charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) At the hearing, the court shall hear evidence and make findings of fact and rulings of law as to whether the property is subject to forfeiture under this chapter.  Except in the case of proceeds, upon a finding that the property is subject to forfeiture the court shall determine whether the forfeiture of the property is not excessive in relation to the underlying criminal offense.  In making this determination the court shall consider whether in addition to any other pertinent considerations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) There is a substantial connection between the property to be forfeited and the underlying drug offense;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Criminal activities conducted by or through the use of the property were extensive;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The value of the property to be forfeited greatly outweighs the value of the drugs that were or would have been likely to be distributed, the costs of the investigation and prosecution, and the harm caused by the criminal conduct.
<br>
The court shall, thereupon, make a final order, from which all parties shall have a right of appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Final orders for forfeiture of property under this section or under RSA 318-B:17-d shall be implemented by the department of justice and shall provide for disposition of the items or property interests by the state in any manner not prohibited by law, including retention for official use by law enforcement or other public agencies or sale at public auction.  The department of justice shall pay the reasonable expenses of the forfeiture proceeding, seizure, storage, maintenance of custody, advertising, court costs and notice of sale from any money forfeited and from the proceeds of any sale or public auction of forfeited items.  All outstanding recorded liens on said items or property interests seized shall be paid in full upon conclusion of the court proceedings from the proceeds of any sale or public auction of forfeited items.  The balance remaining shall be distributed by the department of justice as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Of the first $500,000:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Forty-five percent shall be returned to the fiscal officer or officers of the municipal, county, state, or federal government which provided the law enforcement agency or agencies responsible for the seizure.  Moneys returned to each fiscal officer shall be deposited in a special account and shall be used primarily for meeting expenses incurred by law enforcement agencies in connection with drug-related investigations.  Except as provided in RSA 31:95-b, such funds shall be available for expenditure without further appropriation by the legislative body of the municipal, county, state or federal government, and shall not be transferred or expended for any other purpose.  Moneys returned to a state law enforcement agency shall be deposited in a special nonlapsing account established within the office of the state treasurer and shall be in addition to all other state appropriations to such agency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Ten percent shall be deposited into a special nonlapsing account established within the office of the state treasurer for the department of health and human services;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Forty-five percent shall be deposited in a revolving drug forfeiture fund, administered by the department of justice pursuant to RSA 318-B:17-c;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Of any balance remaining:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Ten percent shall be deposited in the manner prescribed in subparagraph V(a)(2) of this section;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Ninety percent shall be deposited in the manner prescribed in subparagraph V(a)(3) of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The total amount of payments made to the special account for the department of health and human services pursuant to subparagraphs V(a)(2) and V(b)(1) of this section shall not exceed $400,000 in any fiscal year and any excess over $400,000 which would otherwise be paid to such special account under this section shall be deposited in the general fund.  The revolving drug forfeiture fund shall at no time exceed $1,000,000.  All sums in the revolving drug forfeiture fund in excess of $1,000,000 shall be credited to the general fund.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the request of the attorney general, a county attorney or any law enforcement agency, the laboratory employee performing the chemical analysis shall prepare a certificate.  The employee shall sign the certificate under oath and shall include in the certificate an attestation as to the result of the analysis.  The presentation of this certificate to a court by any party to a proceeding shall be evidence that all of the requirements and provisions of this section have been complied with.  This certificate shall be sworn to before a notary public or other person empowered by law to take oaths and shall contain a statement establishing the following:  the type of analysis performed;  the result achieved;  any conclusions reached based upon that result;  that the subscriber is the person who performed the analysis and made the conclusions;  the subscriber's training or experience to perform the analysis;  and the nature and condition of the equipment used.  When properly executed, the certificate shall, subject to paragraph II of this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law, be admissible evidence of the composition, quality, and quantity of the substance submitted to the laboratory for analysis, and the court shall take judicial notice of the signature of the person performing the analysis and of the fact that he is that person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever a party intends to proffer in a criminal proceeding a certificate executed pursuant to this section, notice of an intent to proffer that certificate and all reports relating to the analysis in question, including a copy of the certificate, shall be conveyed to the opposing party or parties at least 25 days before the proceeding begins.  An opposing party who intends to object to the admission into evidence of a certificate shall give notice of objection and the specific grounds for the objection within 10 days upon receiving the adversary's notice of intent to proffer the certificate.  Whenever a notice of objection is filed, admissibility of the certificate shall be determined not later than 10 days before the beginning of the trial.  A proffered certificate shall be admitted in evidence unless it appears from the notice of objection and specific grounds for that objection that the composition, quality, or quantity of the substance submitted to the laboratory for analysis will be contested at trial.  A failure to comply with the time limitations regarding the notice of objection required by this section shall constitute a waiver of any objection to the admission of the certificate.  The time limitations set forth in this section shall not be relaxed except upon a showing of good cause.
