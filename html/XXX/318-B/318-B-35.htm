I. The program may provide information in the prescription health and safety program upon request only to the following persons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) By electronic or written request to prescribers and dispensers within the state who are registered with the program:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) For the purpose of providing medical or pharmaceutical care to a specific patient;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For reviewing information regarding prescriptions issued or dispensed by the requester.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) By written request, to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A patient who requests his or her own prescription monitoring information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The board of dentistry, the board of medicine, the board of nursing, the board of registration in optometry, the board of podiatry, the board of veterinary medicine, and the pharmacy board;  provided, however, that the request is pursuant to the boards' official duties and responsibilities and the disclosures to each board relate only to its licensees and only with respect to those licensees whose prescribing or dispensing activities indicate possible fraudulent conduct.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Authorized law enforcement officials on a case-by-case basis for the purpose of investigation and prosecution of a criminal offense when presented with a court order based on probable cause.  No law enforcement agency or official shall have direct access to the program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A controlled drug prescription health and safety program from another state on a case-by-case basis, if an agreement is in place with the other state to ensure that the information is used and disseminated pursuant to the requirements of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The program shall notify the appropriate regulatory board listed in subparagraph I(b)(2) and the prescriber or dispenser at such regular intervals as may be established by the board if there is reasonable cause to believe a violation of law or breach of professional standards may have occurred.  The program shall provide prescription information required or necessary for an investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The program shall review the information to identify information that appears to indicate whether a person may be obtaining prescriptions in a manner that may represent misuse or abuse of schedule II-IV controlled substances.  When such information is identified, the program shall notify the practitioner who prescribed the prescription.
