&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Licenses and certifications shall be renewed every 24 months after initial licensure or certification upon payment of a fee and presentation of satisfactory proof of completion of continuing education requirements pursuant to RSA 330-C:24.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Licensees and certification holders shall have a grace period of 30 days after expiration in which to renew retroactively if they otherwise are entitled to have their licenses or certifications renewed and pay to the board the renewal fee and any late fee set by the board under rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A suspended license or certification shall be subject to expiration and may be renewed as provided in this chapter, but such renewal shall not entitle the person, while the license or certification remains suspended and until it is reinstated, to engage in the activity, or in any other conduct or activity in violation of the order under which the license or certification was suspended.  If a suspended license or certification is reinstated after its expiration, the person, as a condition of reinstatement, shall pay a reinstatement fee that shall equal the renewal fee in effect on the last regular renewal date immediately preceding the date of reinstatement, plus any late fee set by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A license or certification revoked on disciplinary grounds may not be renewed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Upon the request of a licensee or certificate holder who is a member of the armed forces of the United States, a member of any reserve component of the armed forces, or a member of the national guard, the board is authorized to place the person's license or certification on inactive status whenever such person is called to active military duty.  The board is authorized to return to active status any license or certification placed on inactive status at any time within the 2 years following the release from active military duty of the licensee or certificate holder, upon a written request accompanied by the payment of renewal fee if the license or certificate has expired, and accompanied by proof of completion of the current continuing education requirements.
