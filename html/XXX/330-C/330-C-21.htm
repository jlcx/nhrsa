&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 330-C:21 Applicants From Other States. &#150;</b>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may license or issue a certification to any applicant who is licensed or certified in any other state, provided the other state's requirements are substantially equivalent to or more stringent than those of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may license or issue a certification to any applicant who is licensed or certified in any other state if the other state's requirements are not substantially equivalent to those of this state solely because the applicant has obtained a master's degree in a discipline described in RSA 330-C:16, I(a) which is less than a 60-hour degree.  An individual licensed under this paragraph shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Complete the necessary additional hours of course work in co-occurring disorders pursuant to standards established by the board within 5 years from the effective date of licensure or certification;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Have completed 3,000 hours of clinically supervised work experience in the treatment of substance use and co-occurring disorders.  These hours may be completed after the applicant has been issued the master's degree.  Up to 1,500 hours of clinically supervised work experience accumulated by the applicant during his or her practice as a LADC may be counted toward the required 3,000 hours.  In addition, a current license issued by the board of mental health practice may be substituted for 1,500 hours of the required 3,000 hours of clinically supervised work experience;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Conduct his or her practice as an MLADC in full compliance with RSA 330-C:10;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Notify the board in writing that he or she has completed the requirements in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If an individual licensed under paragraph II does not satisfy the requirements of subparagraph II(a) within 5 years of initial licensure or certification, the board shall not renew the individual's MLADC license but shall, if the individual meets all the requirements for licensure as a LADC, issue a LADC license to the individual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may waive provisions of this chapter requiring supervised work experience and practical training and grant a license as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor or master licensed alcohol and drug counselor to any applicant who presents proof of active licensed practice in another jurisdiction of the United States for a period of 10 years or more.
