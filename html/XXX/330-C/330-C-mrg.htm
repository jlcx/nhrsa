&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The board may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony, and, after consultation with an attorney employed by the state of New Hampshire, issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents and things only in a formal investigation or an adjudicative hearing, except that subpoenas for medical records and pharmacy records, as provided in paragraph V, may be issued at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board may serve a subpoena on any licensee or certificate holder of the board by certified mail, but shall serve a subpoena on any other person in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules required in 42 C.F.R. Part 2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Persons licensed or certified by the board shall not be entitled to a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state, which are necessary to respond to a subpoena issued by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any board-issued subpoena related to a board hearing or investigation shall be valid if annotated "Fees Guaranteed by the New Hampshire Board of Licensing for Alcohol and Other Drug Use Professionals.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A minimum of 48 hours' notice shall be given for compliance with a subpoena issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board may at any time subpoena client records from its licensees or certificate holders, or other health care providers, or health care facilities licensed or certified in this state to the extent that the records sought are relevant to matters within the board's regulatory authority.  Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal delivery to the address shown on the respondent's current license or certificate, and shall require no witness or other fee.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Complaints of misconduct shall be in writing and shall be treated as petitions for the commencement of a disciplinary hearing.  The board shall determine whether a complaint alleges misconduct sufficient to support disciplinary proceedings.  If the board determines that it does, the board shall forward a copy of the complaint to the person complained against within 5 business days of its determination.  If the board determines that it does not, the board shall send the complainant a written notice of dismissal of the complaint.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If an investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee or certificate holder without the consent of a complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. At any time during an investigation of a complaint, and without issuing a subpoena, the board may mail a copy of a complaint to the person named in the complaint, and may require in a written request that the licensee or certificate holder and his or her employer provide detailed and good faith written responses to allegations identified by the board and also provide copies of all records concerning any client identified in the complaint.  The licensee or certificate holder and others receiving inquiries from the board shall respond within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days as the board may specify.  This procedure may also be used in connection with matters the board has undertaken to investigate on its own motion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 330-C:29 Hearings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may hold adjudicative hearings concerning allegations of misconduct or other matters within the scope of this chapter.  Such hearings shall be public proceedings.  Any member of the board other than the public members, or any other qualified person appointed by the board, shall have authority to preside at such a hearing and to issue oaths or affirmations to witnesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall give the respondent and the complainant, if any, at least 15 days' written notice of the date, time, and place of a hearing, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  Such notice shall comply with RSA 541-A and include an itemization of the issues to be heard, and, in the case of a disciplinary hearing, a statement as to whether the action has been initiated by a written complaint or upon the board's own motion, or both.  If a written complaint is involved, the notice shall provide the complainant with a reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.  Such notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the complainant and to the respondent at the address provided by the respondent currently on file at the board offices.  Notice mailed in compliance with this section shall be deemed served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may at any time dispose of allegations in a complaint, investigation, or disciplinary hearing by settlement, default, or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for failing to state a proper basis for disciplinary action, or by summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts.  In disciplinary hearings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but any final disciplinary action or decision which occurs without holding a public hearing shall be publicly released at the time it is served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Final disciplinary actions and other adjudicative decisions made by the board shall be in writing and served upon the parties.  Such decisions shall not be released to the public until they are served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation may be represented by legal counsel or other representative, but the board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide such representation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board shall hear any complaint not resolved at or prior to a prehearing conference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In the case of sanctions for discipline in another jurisdiction, the decision of the other jurisdiction's disciplinary authority may not be collaterally attacked and the board may impose any of the sanctions set forth in this chapter, but shall provide notice and an opportunity to be heard if it intends to impose sanctions above those imposed by the other jurisdiction.
