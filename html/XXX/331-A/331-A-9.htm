&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 331-A:9 Ethics Code. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commission shall adopt by rule under RSA 541-A an ethics code for commissioners and commission employees.  This code shall include, but not be limited to, the following provisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No commission member shall participate in any action related to the issuance of a license or disciplinary matter involving the member or a person with whom the member is personally or professionally associated, or in any such action in which the member has a direct financial interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No commission member or commission employee shall, for compensation of any type, teach or participate in any preparatory or continuing education effort approved by the commission, except that a commission member or commission employee may, in such capacity, participate in a preparatory or continuing education program and receive such compensation as is normally authorized for commission-related business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No more than one commission member shall serve as an officer of a professional association which represents real estate brokers or salespeople.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No commission employee shall be issued an active real estate license throughout the duration of employment with the commission.  A commission employee shall be allowed to apply for an inactive real estate license during employment with the commission, but the license shall remain inactive during such employment.  A commission employee shall not obtain a real estate license in another state based on the inactive license obtained in New Hampshire during such employment with the commission.
