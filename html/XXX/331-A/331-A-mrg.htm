&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any licensee who does not want to perform as a broker or salesperson as defined in RSA 331-A:2, and who wants to preserve the license while not engaged in any brokerage activities, including the receiving of referral fees or any other form of compensation, may surrender that license to the commission for placement on inactive status.  The commission shall place the licensee on inactive status only upon a written request by the licensee.  While on inactive status, the licensee shall renew the license biennially by satisfying the renewal requirements under RSA 331-A:19 and the continuing education requirements adopted by the commission, but is not required to maintain a place of business, or in the case of a licensed principal or managing broker, to maintain a surety bond pursuant to RSA 331-A:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any licensee on inactive license status may have the license reinstated to active status by demonstrating compliance in the previous biennium with the continuing education requirements adopted by the commission and requesting to change status from inactive to active, and, in the case of a licensed principal or managing broker, providing evidence of a surety bond as required by RSA 331-A:14.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 331-A:13 Escrow Accounts of Broker;  Interest;  Audit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The principal broker shall maintain an escrow account or accounts, separate and apart from the individual or office account, in which all deposits on fully executed contracts shall be promptly deposited.  The escrow account or accounts shall be maintained in an insured financial institution within the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The principal broker may place the deposit in an interest-bearing escrow or trust account or instrument.  The interest earned shall accrue to the party making the deposit as a sum to be used toward the purchase price unless otherwise agreed in writing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No checks shall be drawn against uncollected contract deposits in the escrow account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Withdrawal of contract deposits shall be allowed to be forwarded to the closing agent, title company, or attorney, prior to performance of a contract for the purpose of performance.  Otherwise, none of the contract deposits shall be withdrawn until the contract has been terminated by performance, by contemporaneous agreement in writing between all parties, or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, except as provided by paragraph VI of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. On licensure, the principal broker shall sign a permit giving the commission permission to audit the escrow account or accounts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a principal broker retains a contract deposit for a period exceeding 90 days from the contract closing date, without securing performance, a written agreement, or a court order as required in paragraph IV of this section, the principal broker may release the contract deposit to one or more parties to the contract by initiating a release process.  The release process requires the principal broker to notify all parties by certified mail that the deposit will be distributed to the parties specified in the letter if the parties fail to perform, enter into a written mutual release, or initiate litigation within 60 days of the mailing date of the certified letter.  If neither buyer nor seller initiates litigation or enters into a written release within 60 days of the mailing date of the certified letter, the principal broker may release the deposit without penalty under this section.  The principal broker's release of this deposit under this paragraph releases the principal broker solely from liability under this chapter, as opposed to civil liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A principal broker may deposit business or personal funds into an escrow account to cover service charges only, assessed to the account by the bank or depository where the account is located, or to maintain a minimum balance in the account as required by the regulations of the bank or depository.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If a principal broker licensed under this chapter holds funds entrusted to him or her pursuant to a written agreement for the sale or lease of real property and the written agreement expressly authorizes the principal broker, or firm, as escrow agent, to continue to hold the funds in the event of a dispute between the buyer or tenant and seller or landlord concerning entitlement to the funds, no claim shall be maintained against the principal broker, or firm, as escrow agent, whether as trustee, stakeholder, or otherwise, if the escrow agent has complied with the mutual written instructions of the buyer or tenant and seller or landlord, if any, and any order or judgment of a court or final decision of an arbitrator with regard to accounting for or disbursing the funds.  In an action commenced with regard to entitlement to such escrowed funds, a party to the action may file a motion seeking an order to have the funds paid into court by the escrow agent.  Written notice of the motion shall be given by the moving party to all other parties and to the escrow agent.  The escrow agent shall pay the funds into court within 10 days of receipt of the order on the motion or within such other time as provided by the court.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If representing a buyer or tenant, comply with all duties as required in RSA 331-A:25-c.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Appointment of a designated agent shall not be made without the written consent of the party at the commencement of the party's agency relationship with the real estate brokerage firm.  There shall be a conclusive presumption that a seller or landlord or a buyer or tenant has consented to a designated agency relationship, if the party signed a brokerage agreement containing an explanation of designated agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon appointment of a designated agent, the responsibility to satisfy agency duties owed to a buyer or tenant or a seller or landlord shall be the responsibility of the designated agent, and not other licensees affiliated with the same firm.

The appointing agent is neutral as to any conflicting interests of the seller or landlord and buyer or tenant but shall continue to owe the seller or landlord and the buyer or tenant the duties of confidentiality, disclosure of material information, and accounting for funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) When consent to designated agency has been given by the seller or landlord and the buyer or tenant, written notice shall also be provided to the seller or landlord and the buyer or tenant that designated agency has occurred with both the seller or landlord and buyer or tenant in the transaction.  This notice shall be provided prior to the execution of the purchase and sale or lease agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the designated seller's agent and the designated buyer's agent in a transaction are affiliated with the same broker and the seller or landlord and the buyer or tenant each have consented to designated agency, a separate consent to dual agency of the appointing agent shall not be required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the designated seller or landlord agent is also the designated buyer or tenant agent in the same transaction, the designated agent is a dual agent and a separate informed consent to dual agency shall be required in accordance with RSA 331-A:25-d.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Appointment of a designated agent shall not limit the liability or responsibility of the appointing agent and principal broker for breach of duty by the designated agent.

IX. Designated agents who are affiliated with the same managing broker in the same transaction shall not be considered dual agents, unless the same designated agent has agreed to represent both buyer and seller.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Dual agency does not occur between appointing agents who have separately appointed the designated seller agent and the designated buyer agent within the same firm.  Appointing agents receipt of confidential information shall not be imputed to any other appointing or affiliated agents from the same firm.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Dual agency does not occur in firms that represent buyers only and that have appointed designated buyer agents within the firm, or firms that represent sellers only and that have appointed designated seller agents within the firm.
