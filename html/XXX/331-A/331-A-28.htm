If, after a hearing, the commission finds a violation of this chapter, the commission may impose one or more of the following sanctions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Suspend, revoke, or deny an accreditation or the renewal of an accreditation.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The action of the commission in revoking, suspending, or denying a license or accreditation, or levying a fine, shall be subject to appeal to the superior court at the instance of the licensee or an accredited individual, institution, or organization, within 30 days after the filing of the commission's decision.  An appeal shall suspend the commission's decision.  The record of the hearing of the action of the commission shall be presented to the superior court for review and the superior court shall give the review under this chapter priority on the court calendar.  The superior court may confirm, reverse, or modify the commission's decision, or order a trial de novo without a jury as justice may require.
