<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A real estate principal broker who proposes to use a registered trade name in connection with a firm broker license or individual principal broker license shall state that fact on an amendment form, and submit the form along with the appropriate fee, the firm broker license or individual principal broker license to be amended, and a trade name registration form.  The firm broker license or individual principal broker license shall be amended to include the trade name.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is the responsibility of all licensees to notify the commission in writing of any changes to the licensee's resident address, mailing address and work location address.

Such notice shall be accompanied by the salesperson's or associate broker's license.
