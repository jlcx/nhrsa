&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 313-A:19 Shop Licensure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person, as owner, manager, or agent, to open, establish, conduct, or maintain a salon, barbershop, or mobile barbershop without first having obtained a shop license from the board.  Application for such shop license shall be made to the board in writing and shall state the name and address of the owner of such shop, the shop's address or, in the case of a mobile barbershop, the business mailing address of the owner, and such other information as may be required by the board.  Licenses under this section shall be conspicuously posted within the licensed establishment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Any licensed barber, cosmetologist, manicurist, or esthetician who has completed one year of actual experience in a salon or barbershop shall, upon written application accompanied by the required fees, receive a license to operate a salon, barbershop, or mobile barbershop in this state, provided that the salon, barbershop, or mobile barbershop meets all requirements established in the rules of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Booths attached to or within a salon or barbershop that are operated independently of the salon or barbershop shall be subject to licensure in the same manner as an independent establishment, except that each independently operated booth shall not be required to have a separate sink or shampoo bowl.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event of a change of location of any licensed shop and upon notice thereof, the board shall issue a transfer of licensure of such shop to its new location, provided such new location meets the requirements of this section.  The board may revoke any shop license upon a finding that such shop fails to comply with this chapter or the rules adopted by the board;  provided that, before any such certificate shall be revoked, the holder shall have notice thereof and be granted a proper hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition to licenses issued under paragraph II, the board may issue a license to an owner of a salon or barbershop who does not personally engage in cosmetology, barbering, or esthetics, provided the salon or barbershop shall fulfill all requirements set forth in the rules of the board and provided further that the owner has paid the required license fee for such salon or barbershop and employs a licensed cosmetologist, barber, manicurist, or esthetician as manager who has previously completed one year of actual experience in a licensed salon or barbershop.  However, this section shall not authorize such owner to practice cosmetology, barbering, manicuring, or esthetics unless the owner has a cosmetologist, barber, or esthetician license.
