I. No person under the age of 18 shall be allowed to utilize a tanning device at a tanning facility without the written consent of that person's parent or legal guardian and without an operator present.  Proof of age shall be satisfied with a driver's license or other government issued identification containing date of birth and a photograph of the individual.  This consent requirement shall be satisfied only if the parent or legal guardian is physically present at the time of the initial use of the tanning device, and the responsible adult signs a document declaring that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of the minor and attesting to the age of the minor.  The consent of the parent or legal guardian shall be valid for 12 subsequent uses of the tanning device by the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No minors under the age of 14 shall be allowed to utilize a tanning device at a tanning facility without a written order from a physician licensed under RSA 329.  Persons using a tanning facility under the provisions of this paragraph shall be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian for every use of the tanning facility.
