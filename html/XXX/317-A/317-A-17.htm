In any such proceeding, the decision of the foreign licensing authority may not be collaterally attacked, but the licensee or applicant shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate why a lesser sanction should be imposed.  When acting under this paragraph, the board may issue any disciplinary sanction or take any action with regard to a license application, which would otherwise be permitted by this chapter, including sanctions or actions more stringent than those imposed by the foreign jurisdiction.  The board shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to handling summary proceedings brought under this paragraph, but shall furnish the respondent at least 10 days' written notice and an opportunity to be heard.
<br>

V. (a) Every insurer, including self-insurers, providing professional liability insurance to a licensee of the board shall send a complete report to the board as to all reservable claims and suits coincident with the initiation of an action for dental injury within 30 days after the initiation of the action.  For the purpose of this paragraph, dental injury means any adverse, untoward, or undesired consequences arising out of or sustained in the course of professional services rendered by a dental care provider, whether resulting from negligence, error, or omission in the performance of such services;  from rendition of such services without informed consent or in breach of warranty or in violation of contract;  from failure to diagnose;  from premature abandonment of a patient or of a course of treatment;  from failure properly to maintain equipment or appliances necessary to the rendition of such services;  or otherwise arising out of or sustained in the course of such services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board shall conduct an investigation of any person licensed by the board who has been the subject of 3 insurance claims or legal judgments for medical injury as defined in RSA 329:17, III, which pertain to 3 different events within any consecutive 5-year period commencing with January 1, 1988.
