&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 317-A:18 Investigatory Powers of the Board;  Complaints. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may investigate possible misconduct by licensees and any other matters governed by the provisions of this chapter.  Investigations may be conducted with or without the issuance of a board order setting forth the general scope of the investigation, and with or without prior notification to the licensee.  An investigation may include unannounced inspections of the licensee's practice location when deemed necessary to determine day-to-day practices or to prevent evidence from being hidden, altered, or destroyed.  Board investigations and any information obtained by the board pursuant to such investigations shall be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, unless such information subsequently becomes the subject of a public disciplinary hearing.  However, the board may disclose information obtained in an investigation to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this state or any other jurisdiction, or in accordance with specific statutory requirements or court orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may retain legal counsel, dental advisors or other investigators to assist with any investigation and with adjudicatory hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may commence a formal or informal investigation, or an adjudicative hearing, concerning allegations of misconduct and other matters within the scope of this chapter on its own motion whenever it has a reasonable basis for doing so, and the type of procedure chosen shall be a matter reserved to the discretion of the board.  Investigations may be conducted on an ex parte basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The board may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony, and issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents during any formal investigation or adjudicatory hearing.  The board may also subpoena patient records, as provided in paragraph V, during formal investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board shall serve any subpoena not covered by paragraph V in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules established by the superior court, except that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any person licensed by the board shall not be entitled to a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The board shall not be required to tender witness fees and mileage expenses in advance if the subpoena is annotated "fees guaranteed by the New Hampshire board of dental examiners.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The respondent shall be allowed at least 48 hours to comply with a subpoena issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board may at any time subpoena dental records from its licensees and patient records from hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers or facilities licensed by or certified in this state.  Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal delivery to the address shown on the licensee's current license, and no witness or other fee shall be required.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All licensees and any persons applying for licensure or any other privilege granted by the board shall have the duty to keep the board informed of their current business and residence addresses. Notice of any hearing or other action taken under this chapter shall be deemed adequate if notice is mailed to the most recent home or business address furnished to the board by the licensee, pursuant to RSA 317-A:13, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any complaint of licensee misconduct shall be in writing and shall be treated as a petition for the commencement of an adjudicatory hearing.  The board shall fairly investigate all complaints to the extent and in the manner warranted by the allegations.  Any complaint which fails to state a cause of action may be summarily denied in whole or in part.  Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.  If an investigation of a complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, the board may settle the allegations against the licensee without the consent of a complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute and the complainant is given an opportunity to comment upon the terms of the proposed settlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. At the commencement of an adjudicatory proceeding, or at any time during a formal or informal investigation, and without issuing a subpoena, the board may mail a statement of the issues being investigated or heard to any licensee or other person who is a proper subject of inquiry and require the licensee or other person to provide a detailed and good faith written response to the allegations identified by the board.  The licensee or other person shall provide complete copies of office records concerning any patient whose treatment is relevant to the matters at issue.  The licensee shall respond to such request within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days, as the board may specify in its written request.

If a written complaint is involved, the complainant shall also receive a copy of the hearing notice and shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation may be represented by legal counsel, but the board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may at any time dispose of issues or allegations at an adjudicatory hearing, or an investigation, by default, settlement agreement, or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for failing to state a proper basis for disciplinary action.  In adjudicatory or disciplinary hearings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but all final disciplinary actions, including those which occur without holding a public hearing, shall be available to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Adjudicatory decisions and final disciplinary actions of the board shall be made by a majority of the board members participating in the decision.  Such decisions shall not be made public until they have been reduced to writing, signed by a representative of the board, and served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Decisions of the board may be appealed to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541.  The court shall not stay any disciplinary sanction imposed by the board pending appeal, if the board has determined that the sanction is required for the public safety and welfare.
