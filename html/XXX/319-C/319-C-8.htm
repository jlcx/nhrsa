<codesect>
Each applicant for licensure shall present to the board, on forms furnished by the board, a written application for examination and license, containing such information as the board may require, accompanied by the required application fee established by the board.  Proctored examinations shall be written, written and oral, oral, or computerized as approved by the board, and shall be of a thorough and practical character.  They shall include such provisions of the National Electrical Code as the board may deem appropriate.  Any person failing to pass his or her first examination may be reexamined at any subsequent examination meeting of the board or by an examination entity approved by the board, and thereafter may be examined as often as he or she may desire upon submitting the written application for examination and license and payment of the required application fee as set forth in this chapter.
