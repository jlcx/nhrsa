&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329-C:1 Purpose.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the interstate medical licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards and provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients.  The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing medical practice act.  The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located.  State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329-C:15 Rulemaking Functions of the Interstate Commission. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the interstate commission shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Model State Administrative Procedure Act'' of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success.  The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the interstate commission.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 329-C:18 Default Procedures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the compact, or the rules and bylaws of the interstate commission promulgated under the compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission.  The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the compact shall terminate on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The interstate commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state or the withdrawal of a member state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The member state which has been terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
