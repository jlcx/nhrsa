The board shall charge a fee for each application for initial issuance or renewal of a permit under this section in an amount prescribed by the board by rule.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. Applicants for initial issuance or renewal of permits under this section shall in their application list all states in which they have applied for or hold permits as CPA firms and list any past denial, revocation, or suspension of a license or permit by any other state, and each holder of or applicant for a permit under this section shall notify the board in writing, within 30 days after its occurrence, of any change in the identities of partners, officers, shareholders, members, or managers whose principal place of business is in this state, any change in the number or location of offices within the state, any change in the identity of the persons in charge of such offices, and any issuance, denial, revocation, or suspension of license or permit by any other state.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII.

This subparagraph shall not be construed to limit the board's subpoena power under RSA 309-B:11, I;  nor shall it be construed to prevent the board from obtaining from the applicant, its peer review report, the related letter of comment, and the related letter of response.">
