The board shall grant or renew certificates to persons who make application and demonstrate that their qualifications, including where applicable the qualifications prescribed by RSA 309-B:5, are in accordance with the requirements of this section, or that they are eligible for licensure under the substantial equivalency standards set out in RSA 309-B:6.  The holder of a certificate issued under this section may provide attest services as defined in RSA 309-B:3, I(a), and compilation services as defined in RSA 309-B:3, III-a, only in a CPA firm that holds a permit issued under RSA 309-B:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Certificates shall be initially issued, and renewed, for periods of not more than 3 years.  Annual periods shall coincide with the state's fiscal year, beginning on July 1 and ending on the subsequent June 30.  Applications for such certificates shall be made in such form, and in the case of applications for renewal, between such dates, as the board shall by rule specify.  The licensee shall have 60 days to renew the certificate.  If the renewal forms and fees are not submitted within 60 days after the expiration date of the license, the licensee shall file an application for return to active practice which shall be required to return to active status.  A certificate shall remain valid for the period of time that the board requires to act on the application for renewal, provided that the renewal was submitted in accordance with the rules adopted by the board.  The board shall grant or deny any application no later than 90 days after the application is filed in proper form.  In any case where the applicant seeks the opportunity to show that issuance or renewal of a certificate was mistakenly denied, or where the board is not able to determine whether it should be granted or denied, the board may issue to the applicant a provisional certificate, which shall expire 90 days after its issuance or when the board determines whether or not to issue or renew the certificate for which application was made, whichever shall first occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. With regard to applicants that are not eligible for reciprocity under the substantial equivalency standard set out in RSA 309-B:6, I(b), the board shall issue a certificate to a holder of a certificate, license, or permit issued by another state upon a showing that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The applicant passed the examination required for issuance of the applicant's certificate with grades that would have been passing grades at the time in this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The applicant had at least 4 years of experience outside of this state of the type described in RSA 309-B:5 or meets equivalent requirements prescribed by the board by rule, after passing the examination upon which the applicant's certificate was based and within the 10 years immediately preceding the application;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the applicant's certificate, license, or permit was issued more than one year prior to the application for issuance of an initial certificate under this section, that the applicant has fulfilled the requirements of continuing professional education that would have been applicable under paragraph IV of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. (a) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph III, a certificate holder licensed by another state who establishes his or her principal place of business in this state shall request the issuance of a certificate from the board prior to establishing such principal place of business.  The board shall issue a certificate to such person who obtains from the NASBA National Qualification Appraisal Service verification that such individual's CPA qualifications are substantially equivalent to the CPA licensure requirements of the AICPA/NASBA Uniform Accountancy Act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An application under this paragraph may be made through the NASBA Qualification Appraisal Service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may charge a fee to any licensee of another state receiving a reciprocal certificate under this section, in accordance with rules adopted by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Persons requesting issuance of certificates under paragraph IV of this section shall in their request list all states in which they have applied for or hold certificates, or licenses, and list any past denial, revocation, or suspension of a certificate or license and shall notify the board, in writing, within 30 days after its occurrence, of any issuance, denial, revocation, or suspension of a certificate or license by another state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. An application under this section may be made through any qualification service that the board may approve by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. For renewal of a certificate under this section each licensee shall participate in a program of learning designed to insure continuing professional competence.  The requirements established by the board shall specify any reasonable approach to meeting this requirement, including but not limited to, the setting of hours, the setting of fees, and the conducting of random audits of reports submitted to the board.  The approach to meeting this requirement specified by the board shall be comparable to guidelines specified in the Statement on Standards for Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Programs jointly approved by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  The board may by rule create an exception to this requirement for licensees who do not perform or offer to perform for the public one or more kinds of services involving the use of accounting or auditing skills, including issuance of reports on financial statements or of one or more kinds of management advisory, financial advisory or consulting services, or the preparation of tax returns or the furnishing of advice on tax matters.  Licensees granted such an exception by the board shall place the word "inactive'' adjacent to their CPA title or PA title on any business card, letterhead, or any other document or device, with the exception of their CPA certificate or PA registration, on which the CPA or PA title appears.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board shall charge a fee for each application for initial issuance or renewal of a certificate under this section in an amount prescribed by the board by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The board shall issue a certificate to a holder of a substantially equivalent foreign designation, granted in a foreign country, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The foreign authority which granted the designation makes similar provision to allow a person who holds a valid certificate issued by this state to obtain such foreign authority's comparable designation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The foreign designation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Was duly issued by a foreign authority that regulates the practice of public accountancy and the foreign designation has not expired or been revoked or suspended;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Entitles the holder to issue reports upon financial statements;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Was issued upon the basis of educational, examination, and experience requirements established by the foreign authority or by law;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The applicant:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Received the designation, based on educational and examination standards substantially equivalent to those in effect in this state, at the time the foreign designation was granted;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Completed an experience requirement, substantially equivalent to the requirement set out in RSA 309-B:5, IX, in the jurisdiction which granted the foreign designation or has completed at least 4 years of professional experience in this state;  or meets equivalent requirements prescribed by the board by rule, within the 10 years immediately preceding the application;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Passed a uniform qualifying examination in national standards acceptable to the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. An applicant under paragraph X shall in the application list all jurisdictions, foreign and domestic, in which the applicant has applied for or holds a designation to practice public accountancy, and each holder of a certificate issued under this paragraph shall notify the board in writing, within 30 days after its occurrence, of any issuance, denial, revocation, or suspension of a designation or commencement of a disciplinary or enforcement action by any jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The board has the sole authority to interpret the application of the provisions of paragraphs X and XI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The board shall by rule require as a condition for renewal of a certificate under this section, by any certificate holder who issues compilation reports for the public other than through a CPA firm, that such individual undergo, no more frequently than once every 3 years, a peer review conducted in such manner as the board shall by rule specify, and such review shall include verification that such individual has met the competency requirements set out in professional standards for such services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Upon the request of a licensee or certificate holder who is a member of any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States or the national guard and is called to active duty, the board shall place the person's license or certificate on inactive status.  The license or certificate may be reactivated within one year of the person's release from active status by payment of the renewal fee and with proof of completion of the most current continuing education requirement unless still within the renewal period.

Firms may include non-licensee owners but the firm and its ownership shall comply with rules adopted by the board.  For firms of public accountants, at least a simple majority of the ownership of the firm, in terms of financial interests and voting rights, shall belong to holders of registration under RSA 309-B:9.  An individual who has practice privileges under RSA 309-B:6 and who performs services for which a firm permit is required under RSA 309-B:6, IV shall not be required to obtain a certificate from this state pursuant to RSA 309-B:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any CPA or PA firm may include non-licensee owners provided that:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any individual licensee and any individual qualifying for practice privileges under RSA 309-B:6 who signs or authorizes someone to sign the accountant's report on the financial statements on behalf of the firm shall meet the experience requirement of RSA 309-B:8, III(c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An applicant for initial issuance or renewal of a permit to practice under this section shall be required to register each office of the firm within this state with the board and show that all attest services rendered in this state are under the charge of a person holding a valid certificate issued under RSA 309-B:5 or the corresponding provision of prior law or some other state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall charge a fee for each application for initial issuance or renewal of a permit under this section in an amount prescribed by the board by rule.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Firms which fall out of compliance with the provisions of this section due to changes in firm ownership or personnel, after receiving or renewing a license, shall take corrective action to bring the firm back into compliance as quickly as possible.  The board may grant a reasonable period of time for a firm to take such corrective action.  Failure to bring the firm back into compliance within a reasonable period as defined by the board will result in the suspension of the firm permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board shall by rule require, on either a uniform or random basis, as a condition to renewal of permits under this section, that applicants undergo, no more frequently than once every 3 years, peer reviews conducted in such manner as the board shall specify, and such peer review shall include a verification by the reviewer that individuals in the firm who are responsible for attest services and who sign or authorize someone to sign the accountant's report on the financial statements on behalf of the firm meet the experience requirements set out in professional standards for such services, provided that such rule:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Shall be adopted reasonably in advance of the time when it first becomes effective;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Shall include reasonable provision for compliance by an applicant showing that it has, within the preceding 3 years, undergone a peer review that is a satisfactory equivalent to peer review generally required pursuant to this paragraph;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Shall require, with respect to peer reviews contemplated by subparagraph (b), that they be subject to oversight by an oversight body established or sanctioned by board rule, which body shall periodically report to the board on the effectiveness of the review program under its charge, and provide to the board a listing of firms that have participated in a peer review program that is satisfactory to the board;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Shall require, with respect to peer reviews contemplated by subparagraph (b), that the peer review processes be operated and documents maintained in a manner designed to preserve confidentiality, and that neither the board nor any third party, other than the peer review oversight body, shall have access to documents furnished or generated in the course of such peer review.  This subparagraph shall not be construed to limit the board's subpoena power under RSA 309-B:11, I;  nor shall it be construed to prevent the board from obtaining from the applicant, its peer review report, the related letter of comment, and the related letter of response.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 309-B:11 Enforcement Procedures;  Investigations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may, upon receipt of a complaint or other information suggesting violations of this chapter or of the rules of the board, conduct investigations to determine whether there is probable cause to institute proceedings under RSA 309-B:12, 309-B:15, or 309-B:16 against any person or firm for such violation, but an investigation under this section shall not be a prerequisite to such proceedings in the event that a determination of probable cause can be made without investigation.  In aid of such investigations, the board, through its chairperson, shall have the power to compel the testimony of witnesses and the production of documents or other evidence by the issuance of subpoenas.  The board and the defendant may take the depositions of witnesses residing within or without the state pertaining to any matter being investigated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may designate a member, or any other person of appropriate competence, to serve as investigating officer to conduct an investigation.  Upon completion of the investigation, the investigating officer shall file a report with the board.  The board shall find probable cause or lack of probable cause based upon the report or shall return the report to the investigating officer for further investigation.  Unless there has been a determination of probable cause, the report of the investigating officer, the complaint, if any, the testimony and documents submitted in support of the complaint or gathered in the investigation, and the fact of pendency of the investigation shall be treated as confidential information and shall not be disclosed to any person except law enforcement authorities, and, to the extent deemed necessary in order to conduct the investigation, the subject of the investigation, persons whose complaints are being investigated, and witnesses questioned in the course of the investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon a finding of probable cause, if the subject of the investigation is a licensee, the board shall direct that a complaint be issued under RSA 309-B:12, and if the subject of the investigation is not a licensee, the board shall take appropriate action under RSA 309-B:15 or 309-B:16.  Upon a finding of no probable cause, the board shall close the matter and shall thereafter release information relating to the investigation only with the consent of the person or firm under investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may review the publicly available professional work of licensees on a general and random basis, without any requirement of a formal complaint or suspicion of impropriety on the part of any particular licensee.  If, as a result of such review, the board discovers reasonable grounds for a more specific investigation, the board may proceed under paragraphs I through III of this section.

I. In any case where probable cause with respect to a violation by a licensee has been determined by the board, whether following an investigation under RSA 309-B:11, or upon receipt of a written complaint furnishing grounds for a determination of such probable cause, or upon receipt of notice of a decision by the board of accountancy or similar agency of another state, possession of the United States or country furnishing such grounds, the board shall issue a complaint setting forth appropriate charges and set a date for a disciplinary hearing before the board on such charges.  The board shall, not less than 30 days prior to the date of such hearing, serve a copy of the complaint and notice of the time and place of the hearing upon the licensee, together with a copy of the board's rules governing proceedings under this section, either by personal delivery or by mailing a copy by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee at the licensee's address last known to the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A licensee against whom a complaint has been issued under this section shall have the right, reasonably in advance of the hearing, to examine and copy the report of investigation, if any, and any documentary or testimonial evidence and summaries of anticipated evidence in the board's possession relating to the subject matter of the complaint.  The board's rules governing proceedings under this section shall specify the time and manner in which such right may be exercised.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In a hearing under this section the respondent licensee may appear in person or, in the case of a firm, through a duly authorized partner, officer, director, or shareholder member or manager, or by counsel.  The respondent or counsel may examine witnesses and evidence presented in support of the complaint, and may present evidence and witnesses on the licensee's behalf.  The licensee shall have the right, on application to the board, to the issuance of subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The evidence supporting the complaint shall be presented by the investigating officer, by a board member designated for that purpose, or by counsel.  A board member who presents the evidence, or who has conducted the investigation of the matter under RSA 309-B:11, shall not participate in the board's decision of the matter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In a hearing under this section, the board shall be advised by counsel, and such individual shall not be the same counsel who presents or assists in presenting the evidence supporting the complaint under paragraph IV of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In a hearing under this section, the board shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In a hearing under this section, a stenographic or electronic record shall be made and filed with the board.  A transcript need not be prepared unless review is sought under paragraph X of this section or the board determines that there is other good cause for its preparation.  The respondent may request a copy of such record and shall bear the cost of making such copy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In a hearing under this section, a recorded vote of a majority of all members of the board, excluding members disqualified by reason of paragraph IV or other reasons under this section, shall be required to sustain any charge and to impose any penalty with respect to such hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If, after service of a complaint and notice of hearing as provided in paragraph I of this section, the respondent licensee fails to appear at the hearing, the board may proceed to hear evidence against the licensee and may enter such order as it deems warranted by the evidence.  The order shall be final unless the licensee petitions for review under paragraph X of this section, provided, however, that within 30 days from the date of any such order, upon a showing of good cause for the licensee's failure to appear and defend, the board may set aside the order and schedule a new hearing on the complaint to be conducted in accordance with applicable paragraphs of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Any person or firm adversely affected by any order of the board entered after a hearing under this section may appeal such order by filing a written petition with the superior court in the county in which the respondent resides or, if not a resident of this state, in the county in which the respondent has a place of business or resident agent.  An appeal shall not suspend the order of the board unless the court orders otherwise.  The record of the hearing of the board's action shall be presented to the superior court for its review pursuant to the procedures and standards of RSA 541.  The superior court may affirm, reverse, or modify the board's order or may order a trial de novo.  A trial de novo shall be pursuant to the board's rules and the rules of evidence shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. In any case where the board renders a decision imposing discipline against a licensee under RSA 309-B:10 or RSA 309-B:12, the board shall examine its records to determine whether the licensee holds a certificate, license, or a permit in any other state, possession of the United States, or country.  If that is the case, the board shall notify the board of accountancy or other similar regulatory agency of such other state, possession of the United States, or country of its decision, by mail, within 45 days of rendering the decision or within 45 days of a final decision of an appeal by a court reviewing the board's decision, whichever is later.  The board may also furnish information relating to proceedings resulting in disciplinary action to other public authorities and to professional organizations having a disciplinary interest in the licensee.  Where a petition for review has been filed pursuant to RSA 309-B:12, X, the notification and furnishing of information provided for in this paragraph shall await the resolution of such review and, if resolution is in favor of the licensee, no such notification or furnishing of information shall be made.

This restriction shall not prohibit any act of a public official or public employee in the performance of that person's duties as such;  or prohibit the performance by any person from the use of accounting skills, or analyzing and preparing projections of financial data in the performance of management advisory services, financial advisory services, consulting services, the preparation of tax returns, or the furnishing of advice on tax matters.  This restriction also does not apply to non-licensees who may prepare financial statements and issue reports thereon which do not purport to be in compliance with the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Licensees, individuals who have practice privileges under RSA 309-B:6, and firms exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, performing attest services shall provide those services pursuant to statements on standards relating to those services adopted by reference or directly by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No person not holding a valid certificate or a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6 shall use or assume the title or designation "certified public accountant,'' or the abbreviation "CPA'' or any other title, designation, words, letters, abbreviation, sign, card, or device tending to indicate that such person is a certified public accountant.

V. No person shall assume or use the title or designation "public accountant,'' or the abbreviation "PA,'' or any other title, designation, words, letters, abbreviation, sign, card, or device tending to indicate that such person is a public accountant unless such person holds a valid registration issued under RSA 309-B:9.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Persons not licensed under this chapter, unless they qualify for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6 or are exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, shall not use language in any statement relating to the financial affairs of a person or entity which is conventionally used by licensees in reports on financial statements.  In this regard, the board shall issue safe harbor language that persons not licensed under this chapter, or not qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or not exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8 may use in connection with such financial information.  Such disclaimer language shall include the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"I (we) have prepared the accompanying (financial statements) of (name of entity) as of (time period) for the (period) then ended.  This presentation is limited to preparing in the form of financial statements information that is the representation of management (owners).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I (we) have not audited or reviewed the accompanying financial statements and accordingly do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on them.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. No person or firm not holding a valid certificate, permit, or registration issued under RSA 309-B:7, 309-B:8, or 309-B:9, or qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or an exemption from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, shall assume or use any title or designation that includes the words "accountant,'' "auditor,'' or "accounting,'' in connection with any other language, including the language of a report, that implies that such person or firm holds such a certificate, permit, or registration or has special competence as an accountant or auditor.  This paragraph shall not prohibit any officer, partner, or employee of any firm or organization from affixing a signature to any statement in reference to the financial affairs of such firm or organization with any wording designating the position, title, or office that person holds, nor shall it prohibit any act of a public official or employee in the performance of that person's duties.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. No persons holding a certificate or registration, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm holding a permit under this chapter or an exemption from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, shall use a professional or firm name or designation that is misleading about the legal form of the firm, or about the persons or number of persons who are partners, officers, members, managers, or shareholders of the firm, or about any other matter;  provided, however, that names of one or more of the former partners, members, managers or shareholders may be included in the name of a firm or its successor.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. No provision of this section shall have any application to a person holding a certification, designation, degree, license, or permit granted in a foreign country entitling the holder to engage in the practice of public accountancy or its equivalent in such country, whose activities in this state are limited to the provision of professional services to persons or firms who are residents of, governments of, or business entities of the country in which the person holds such entitlement, who performs no attest services as defined, and who issues no reports with respect to the financial statements of any other persons, firms, or governmental units in this state, and who does not use in this state any title or designation other than the one under which that person practices in such country, followed by a translation of such title or designation into English, if it is in a different language, and by the name of such country.

XII. No holder of a certificate issued under RSA 309-B:7 or a registration issued under RSA 309-B:9 shall perform attest services described in RSA 309-B:3, I(a) or compilation services described in RSA 309-B:3, III-a in any firm that does not hold a valid permit issued under RSA 309-B:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. (a) A licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, shall not for a commission recommend or refer to a client any product or service, or for a commission recommend or refer any product or service to be supplied by a client, or receive a commission, when the licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, also performs for that client an attest service as defined in RSA 309-B:3, I or a compilation of a financial statement when the licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, expects, or reasonably might expect, that a third party will use the financial statement and the compilation report does not disclose a lack of independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, who is not prohibited by this section from performing services for or receiving a commission and who is paid or expects to be paid a commission shall disclose that fact to any person or entity to whom the licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, recommends or refers a product or service to which the commission relates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, who accepts a referral fee for recommending or referring any service of a licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, to any person or entity or who pays a referral fee to obtain a client shall disclose such acceptance or payment to the client.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. (a) A licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, shall not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Perform for a contingent fee any professional services for, or receive such a fee from a client for whom the licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, or the licensee's firm or firm of the individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6 performs an attest service as defined in RSA 309-B:3, I or a compilation of a financial statement when the licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, expects, or reasonably might expect, that a third party will use the financial statement and the compilation report does not disclose a lack of independence;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Prepare an original or amended tax return or claim for a tax refund for a contingent fee for any client;  provided however that a licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, may prepare an amended return or claim for refund for a contingent fee if that licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, has a reasonable expectation that the amended return or claim for refund will be the subject of substantive review by the taxing authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prohibition in subparagraph (a) applies during the period in which the licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, is engaged to perform any of the services listed in subparagraph (a) and the period covered by any historical financial statements involved in any such listed services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, a contingent fee is a fee established for the performance of any service pursuant to an arrangement in which no fee will be charged unless a specified finding or result is attained, or in which the amount of the fee is otherwise dependent upon the finding or result of such service.  Solely for purposes of this section, fees are not regarded as being contingent if fixed by courts or other public authorities, or, in tax matters, if determined based on the results of judicial proceedings or the findings of governmental agencies.  The fees of a licensee, individual qualifying for a practice privilege under RSA 309-B:6, or firm exempt from the permit requirement under RSA 309-B:8, may vary depending, for example, on the complexity of services rendered.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
