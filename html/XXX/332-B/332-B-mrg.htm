&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 332-B:15 Investigations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board may investigate possible misconduct by licensees, permittees, certificate holders, and applicants, and other matters included in this chapter.  Investigations may be conducted with or without the issuance of a board order setting forth the general scope of the investigation.  Board investigations and any information obtained by the board pursuant to such investigations shall be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, unless such information is subsequently included in the record in a public disciplinary hearing.  The board may, however, disclose information obtained in its investigations to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this state or any other jurisdiction, or in accordance with specific statutory requirements or court orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may commence a formal or informal investigation, or an adjudicative hearing, concerning allegations of misconduct and other matters within the scope of this chapter on its own motion whenever it has a reasonable basis for doing so, and the type of procedure chosen shall be a matter reserved to the discretion of the board.  Formal or informal investigations may be conducted on an ex parte basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve testimony, and issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents during any formal investigation or adjudicatory hearing, and as provided by paragraph IV of this section.  Subpoenas not covered by paragraph IV shall be served in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules established by the superior court, except that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Board licensees shall not be entitled to a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Witness fees and mileage expenses need not be tendered in advance if the subpoena is annotated:  "Fees Guaranteed by the N.H. Veterinary Board.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The respondent shall be allowed at least 48 hours to comply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may at any time subpoena the professional records of its licensees and relevant veterinary and billing records from pharmacies and drug suppliers, laboratories, veterinary suppliers, and veterinary insurers doing business with veterinary licensees in this state.  Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal delivery to the address provided to the board pursuant to RSA 332-B:15, V, and no witness or other fee shall be necessary for valid service.  A minimum of 15 days' advance notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Persons holding or applying for licenses or permits granted by the board shall keep the board informed of their current business and residence addresses, and shall furnish written notice to the board of any change in such addresses within 30 days from the date the change occurs.  A licensee or applicant shall receive adequate notice of any hearing or other action taken by the board under this chapter if notice is mailed in a timely fashion to the most recent home or business address furnished under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Complaints of licensee misconduct shall be in writing, and shall be treated as requests for the commencement of a disciplinary hearing to which the time limitations of RSA 541-A:29 shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A complaint which fails to state a cause of action may be dismissed or summarily denied in whole or in part.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The board shall fairly investigate all complaints to the extent warranted by the allegations and the resources available to the board.  Following an investigation, the board shall have discretion to decline to prosecute or to defer prosecution on allegations made in any complaint based upon the board's assessment of the seriousness of the alleged misconduct and the resources and priorities of the board.  Board decisions deferring misconduct prosecutions shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to investigate or hear on its own motion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The board may at any time settle misconduct allegations made in a complaint without the consent of the complainant, provided the complainant is given an opportunity to comment in writing upon the terms of the proposed settlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. At the commencement of an adjudicatory proceeding, or at any time during a formal or informal investigation, and without issuing a subpoena, the board, or a person to whom the board has delegated appropriate authority, may mail a statement of the allegations being investigated to a licensee and order that person to provide a detailed and good faith written response thereto.  In such circumstances the board may also require a licensee to furnish complete copies of appropriate professional records concerning matters relevant to allegations at issue and provide access for inspection of clinic or hospital premises.  In both instances, the licensee shall respond within a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days as the board may specify in its written request.

II. (a) Any member of the board, or any other qualified person appointed by the board, may act as the presiding officer in an adjudicatory proceeding and may issue oaths or affirmations to witnesses, rule on evidentiary and other procedural matters, and prepare a proposal for decision as provided by RSA 541-A:34, without regard to any quorum requirements otherwise applicable to board action or activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a non-board member acts as a presiding officer, but does not prepare a proposal for decision, that person may participate in board deliberations only to the extent of providing technical assistance to the board in preparing its final decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If any person acting as a presiding officer prepares a proposal for decision, that person shall not participate in the board's deliberations.

Such hearing notices shall include an itemization of the issues to be heard and shall be public documents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a board investigation includes consideration of a written complaint against a licensee, any hearing notice issued by the board against that licensee shall also be served upon the complainant.  The hearing notice shall constitute a final ruling on the complainant's request for the initiation of disciplinary proceedings, and shall provide the complainant with an opportunity to intervene subject to restrictions which will reasonably advance the public interest objectives of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person appearing as a party or witness in an adjudicatory proceeding, or any person who is the subject of an investigation, or who is questioned in an investigation, is entitled to be represented by legal counsel, but the board shall have no obligation or authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any such person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In adjudicatory proceedings, the board may hold prehearing conferences which are closed to the public and exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A until such time as a public evidentiary hearing is convened in the proceeding.  In any event, settlement discussions engaged in by the parties at prehearing conferences may be conducted off the record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board may dispose of issues or allegations at any time during an investigation or adjudicatory proceeding by issuing a settlement agreement or consent order;  an order of dismissal for default or failure to state a proper basis for disciplinary action;  or a summary judgment order based upon undisputed material facts, provided, however, that disciplinary action taken by the board at any stage of a proceeding, and dispositive action of any kind taken after the issuance of a public hearing notice, shall be reduced to writing and made available to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Final decisions in adjudicatory proceedings shall be made by a majority of the board members eligible to participate in the decision.  Such decisions shall not be made public until they have been reduced to writing, signed by a representative of the board, and served upon the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Final disciplinary actions taken by the board may be appealed to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541, and shall not be subject to stay pending appeal.
