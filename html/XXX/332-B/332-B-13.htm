&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 332-B:13 License Expiration and Renewal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All licenses shall expire biennially on December 31 of each even-numbered year for even-numbered licenses and on December 31 of each odd-numbered year for odd-numbered licenses but may automatically be renewed by filing a renewal application and paying a renewal fee established in rules adopted by the board, subject to paragraph II;  except that for licenses which expire December 31, 2011, odd numbered licenses shall be issued for 2 years and even numbered licenses shall be issued for one year, and the board shall charge fees accordingly.  Not later than one month prior to the expiration date, the board shall mail a notice to licensed veterinarians that their license will expire on December 31 and provide them with a license renewal application.  Persons previously licensed who allow their license to lapse shall be required to file a reinstatement application containing such information as required by the board.  Persons who have allowed their license to lapse more than 5 years shall apply for reinstatement of licensure in accordance with RSA 332-B:17.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may by rule waive the payment of the renewal fee of a licensed veterinarian during the period when the person is on active duty with any branch of the armed services of the United States, not to exceed 3 years or the duration of a national emergency, whichever is longer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As a condition of renewal of license, each licensed veterinarian shall be required to show proof that he or she has attended an approved educational program or programs totaling at least 24 hours in the 2-year period preceding each renewal date.  Approved educational programs shall be at the discretion of the board, in accordance with rules adopted by the board.  The board may excuse a licensee from all or a portion of the educational requirement upon the filing of a petition establishing good cause for the waiver as set forth in rules adopted by the board.
