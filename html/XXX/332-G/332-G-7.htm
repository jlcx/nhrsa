I. Each of the boards or commissions established in this title shall, upon presentation of satisfactory evidence with an application for licensure, certification, or registration, accept education, training, or service completed by an individual as a member of the armed forces, as defined in RSA 21:50, II, toward the qualifications required to receive the license, certificate, or registration in question.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, upon the request of a licensee or registration or certificate holder who is a member of any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States or the national guard and is called to active duty, the corresponding board or commission shall place the person's license registration, or certificate on inactive status.  The license registration, or certificate may be reactivated within one year of the person's release from active status by payment of the renewal fee and with proof of completion of the most current continuing education requirement, if any, unless still within the renewal period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, each of the boards or commissions under this title authorized to conduct licensure, certification, or registration, and examinations therefor, shall upon the presentation of satisfactory evidence by an applicant before the board or commission, facilitate the issuance of a license or certification for a person:  (i) who is certified or licensed in a state other than New Hampshire;  (ii) whose spouse is a member of the armed forces in the United States;  (iii) whose spouse is the subject of a military transfer to New Hampshire;  and (iv) who left employment to accompany a spouse to New Hampshire.  The procedure shall include, but not be limited to, facilitating the issuance of a license, certificate, or registration if, in the opinion of the board or commission, the requirements for licensure, certification, or registration of such other state are substantially equivalent to the requirements for licensure, certification, or registration in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every board or commission under this title shall adopt rules, when applicable, under RSA 541-A for:
<br>

(b) The procedures and notice required for the inactive status of licenses, certificates, or registrations under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Procedures for facilitating issuance of licenses, certificates, or registrations for a spouse of a member of the armed forces as required in paragraph III.
