&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 332-G:10 Criminal Conviction.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No board or commission shall disqualify a person from practicing, pursuing, or engaging in any occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which a license, permit, certificate, or registration is required under this title, nor suspend or revoke such license, certificate, or registration because of a prior conviction of a crime in and of itself.  However, a board or commission may deny a license or certificate, or the renewal of a license or certificate, or may suspend or revoke such license or certificate, because of a prior conviction after considering the nature of the crime and whether there is a substantial and direct relationship to the occupation, trade, vocation, or profession for which the person has applied, and may consider information about the rehabilitation of the convicted person, and the amount of time that has passed since the conviction or release.
