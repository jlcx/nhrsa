No board or commission shall disqualify a person from practicing, pursuing, or engaging in any occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which a license, permit, certificate, or registration is required under this title, nor suspend or revoke such license, certificate, or registration because of a prior conviction of a crime in and of itself.
