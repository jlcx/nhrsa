&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 332-G:11 Investigative Costs.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For any order issued in resolution of a disciplinary proceeding by any board or commission, where such board or commission has found misconduct sufficient to support disciplinary action, the board or commission may require the licensee, registrant, or certificate holder who is the subject of such finding to pay the board or commission a sum not to exceed the reasonable cost of investigation and prosecution of the proceeding.  Except where otherwise limited, this sum shall not exceed $10,000.  This sum may be imposed in addition to any otherwise authorized administrative fines levied by the board or commission as part of the penalty.  The investigative and prosecution costs shall be assessed by the board or commission and any sums recovered shall be credited as restricted revenue for the use of the board or commission and shall not lapse.  Such sums shall be disbursed by the board or commission for any future investigations of complaints.  Orders of the board or commission shall be subject to rehearing and appeal in the manner prescribed by RSA 541.
