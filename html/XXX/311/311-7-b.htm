<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The attorney general may investigate any complaint of unauthorized practice of the law and the attorney general, or a deputy attorney general or an assistant attorney general designated by the attorney general, may subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, examine them under oath, and require the production of any relevant documentary evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The laws relating to the attendance of witnesses in civil actions and the payment of their fees and expenses to those witnesses shall apply to investigations made by the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena or to testify as to any material matter regarding which the person may be interrogated, the superior court, upon application by the attorney general, may issue to the person an order requiring the person to appear before the attorney general, or a deputy attorney general or an assistant attorney general designated by the attorney general, to produce documentary evidence or testify.  Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When requested, public officers, their assistants, clerks or employees shall furnish to the attorney general, the deputy or an assistant attorney general designated by the attorney general all information and assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Investigations under this section shall be confidential.  Any person participating in the investigation who, except as required in the discharge of the person's official duties, discloses to any person, other than to a person under investigation, the name of any person under investigation or any witness examined, or any other information obtained in the investigation is guilty of a misdemeanor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every person whose conduct is investigated under this section shall be furnished with a written specification of the issues which are to be considered, and shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and be heard upon the specified issues.
