I. In order to help protect the interests of New Hampshire sources and the state's economy under a future federal regulatory scheme relating to greenhouse gas emissions, and to help encourage the voluntary reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by New Hampshire sources, the department shall encourage sources to register their inventory of greenhouse gas emissions with the Eastern Climate Registry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall work with other states to expand upon the Eastern Climate Registry and develop a broader multi-state registry for greenhouse gas emissions records to support emissions reporting and reduction policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department shall prepare an annual report for the general court summarizing New Hampshire's participation in the Eastern Climate Registry.
