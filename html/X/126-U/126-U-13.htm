&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 126-U:13 Restriction of the Use of Mechanical Restraint in Courtrooms. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
At any hearing under RSA 169-B, RSA 169-C, or RSA 169-D, the judge may subject a child to mechanical restraint in the courtroom only when the judge finds the restraint to be reasonably necessary to maintain order, prevent the child's escape, or provide for the safety of the courtroom.  Whenever practical, the judge shall provide the child and the child's attorney an opportunity to be heard to contest the use of mechanical restraint before the judge orders its use.  If mechanical restraint is ordered, the judge shall make written findings of fact in support of the order.
