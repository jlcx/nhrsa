&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 126-U:5 Limitation of the Use of Restraint to Emergencies Only. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Restraint shall only be used in a school or facility to ensure the immediate physical safety of persons when there is a substantial and imminent risk of serious bodily harm to the child or others.  The determination of whether the use of restraint is justified under this section may be made with consideration of all relevant circumstances, including whether continued acts of violence by a child to inflict damage to property will create a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to the child or others.  Restraint shall be used only by trained personnel using extreme caution when all other interventions have failed or have been deemed inappropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Restraint shall never be used explicitly or implicitly as punishment for the behavior of a child.
