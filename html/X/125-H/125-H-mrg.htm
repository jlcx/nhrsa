<center><h3>Section 125-H:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-H:1 Findings, Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that protection of the public health and welfare demands a state-wide capacity to assess the nature of and risks to both humans and ecosystems associated with exposure to a variety of environmental contaminants.  Recognizing that health risk assessment entails responding to situations where scientific data and exposure standards are often incomplete at best, the general court finds that the success of such a program requires flexible access to medical, scientific, and engineering expertise in all agencies of state government.  The general court enacts this chapter in order to provide a mechanism for health risk assessment.  The general court intends that the department of health and human services, which has primary state responsibility for protecting the public health, shall be the lead agency for health risk assessment.  It further intends that other state agencies shall cooperate fully in making personnel with training experience in the disciplines necessary to accomplish such assessments available to the department of health and human services on a reasonable basis.  In establishing this function, the general court intends to provide regulatory decision-makers who shall analyze, assess, and manage public and environmental health risks with the most timely and accurate information and analysis available.

<codesect>
In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Acute health effect'' means an adverse health outcome or disease which manifests itself upon or shortly after exposure to an environmental hazard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Adverse health outcome'' means any condition which results in human morbidity, mortality, impaired reproductive function, toxicity, teratogenic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic effects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Chronic health effect'' means an adverse health outcome or disease which manifests itself over a long incubation or latency period.  Chronic health effects can result from either a limited high-level or long-term, low-level exposure to an environmental hazard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Commissioner'' means the commissioner of the department of health and human services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Department'' means the department of health and human services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Dose-response assessment'' means the determination of the relation between the magnitude of exposure to environmental hazards and the probability of occurrence of adverse health effects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Environmental hazard'' means any biological, chemical, or physical agent present in the environment which has the potential of causing disease or adverse health outcome.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Environmental health risk assessment'' means the use of scientific and medical data to define potential health effects of exposure of individuals or populations to environmental hazards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. "Exposure assessment'' means the determination of the extent of human exposure to an environmental hazard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. "Hazard identification'' means the scientific process of collecting and validating data to determine if biological, chemical or physical agents, man-made or naturally occurring, can be causally linked to particular chronic or acute health effects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. "Imminent health hazard'' means the immediate threat to the population of an adverse health outcome posed by an environmental hazard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Risk characterization'' means the description of the nature and, when possible, the magnitude of human risk from an environmental hazard, including its attendant uncertainty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. "Risk management'' means the use of the results of environmental health risk assessments or other information in order to develop and evaluate regulatory options, within a statutory framework, to reduce the risk of harm to human health and ecosystems to the greatest possible degree.
