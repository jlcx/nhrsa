Unless its labeling bears (1) adequate directions for use;  and (2) such adequate warnings against use in those pathological conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health, or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form as are necessary for the protection of users:  provided, that where any requirement of clause (1) of this paragraph, as applied to any drug or device, is not necessary for the protection of the public health, the commissioner shall promulgate regulations exempting such drug or device from such requirements.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII.

<br>

III. If any word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If it is for use by man and contains any quantity of the narcotic or hypnotic substance alpha-eucaine, barbituric acid, beta-eucaine, bromal, cannabis, carbromal, chloral, coca, cocaine, codeine, heroin, marihuana, morphine, opium, paraldehyde, peyote, or sulphonmethane, or any chemical derivative of such substance, which derivative has been by the commissioner after investigation found to be, and by regulation designated as, habit-forming, unless its label bears the name and quantity or proportion of such substance or derivative and in juxtaposition therewith the statement "Warning - May Be Habit Forming.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Unless its labeling bears (1) adequate directions for use;  and (2) such adequate warnings against use in those pathological conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health, or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form as are necessary for the protection of users:  provided, that where any requirement of clause (1) of this paragraph, as applied to any drug or device, is not necessary for the protection of the public health, the commissioner shall promulgate regulations exempting such drug or device from such requirements.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If it is a drug and its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading;  or if it is an imitation of another drug;  or if it is offered for sale under the name of another drug.

The act of dispensing a drug contrary to the provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act which results in a drug being misbranded while held for sale.  (2) Any drug dispensed by filling or refilling a written or oral prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs I, IX, XIII, and XIV of this section and the packaging requirements of paragraphs VII and VIII, if the drug bears a label containing the name and address of the dispenser, the serial number and date of the prescription or of its filling, the name of the prescriber and, if stated in the prescription, the name of the patient, and the directions for use and the cautionary statements, if any, contained in such prescription.
