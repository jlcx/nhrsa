&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146:3 Adulterations, Foods. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For the purposes of this chapter an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (1) If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health;  but in case the substance is not an added substance such food shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health;  or (2) if it bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance other than one which is a pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity;  a food additive;  or a color additive, which is unsafe within the meaning of RSA 146:21;  or if it is a raw agricultural commodity and it bears or contains a pesticide chemical which is unsafe within the meaning of RSA 146:21 or if it is or it bears or contains any food additive which is unsafe within the meaning of RSA 146:21;  provided that where a pesticide chemical has been used in or on a raw agricultural commodity in conformity with an exemption granted or tolerance prescribed under RSA 146:21, and such raw agricultural commodity has been subjected to processing such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydrating, or milling, the residue of such pesticide chemical remaining in or on such processed food shall, notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 146:21, not be deemed unsafe if such residue in or on the raw agricultural commodity has been removed to the extent possible in good manufacturing practice, and the concentration of such residue in the processed food when ready-to-eat is not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity;  or (3) if it consists in whole or in part of a diseased, contaminated, filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise unfit for food;  or (4) if it has been produced, prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered diseased, unwholesome, or injurious to health;  or (5) if it is the product of a diseased animal or an animal which has died otherwise than by slaughter or that has been fed upon the uncooked offal from a slaughterhouse;  or (6) if its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health;  or (7) if it is or bears or contains any color additive which is unsafe within the meaning of RSA 146:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (1) If any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom;  or (2) if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part therefor;  or (3) if damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner;  or (4) if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength or make it appear better or of greater value than it is.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If it falls below the standard of purity, quality, or strength which it purports or is represented to possess.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If it is confectionery and it bears or contains any alcohol or non-nutritive article or substance except harmless coloring, harmless flavoring, harmless resinous glaze not in excess of  4/10 of one percent, harmless natural wax not in excess of  4/10 of one percent, harmless natural gum, and pectin;  provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any confectionery by reason of its containing less than  1/2 of one percent by volume of alcohol derived solely from use of flavoring extracts, or to any chewing gum by reason of its containing harmless non-nutritive masticatory substances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any poisonous or deleterious substance added to any food except where such substance is required in the production thereof or cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice, shall be deemed to be unsafe for purposes of the application of RSA 146:3, I(2);  but when such substance is so required or cannot be so avoided, the commissioner shall promulgate regulations limiting the quantity therein or thereon to such extent as the commissioner finds necessary for the protection of public health, and any quantity exceeding the limits so fixed shall also be deemed to be unsafe for purposes of application of RSA 146:3, I(2).  While such a regulation is in effect limiting the quantity of any such substance in the case of any food, such food shall not, by reason of bearing or containing any added amount of such substance, be considered to be adulterated within the meaning of RSA 146:3, I(1).  In determining the quantity of such added substance to be tolerated in or on different articles of food, the commissioner shall take into account the extent to which the use of such substance is required or cannot be avoided in the production of each such article and the other ways in which the consumer may be affected by the same or other poisonous or deleterious substances.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If it is not subject to the provisions of paragraph II of this section and its strength differs from, or its purity or quality falls below, that which it purports or is represented to possess.

The act of dispensing a drug contrary to the provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act which results in a drug being misbranded while held for sale.  (2) Any drug dispensed by filling or refilling a written or oral prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs I, IX, XIII, and XIV of this section and the packaging requirements of paragraphs VII and VIII, if the drug bears a label containing the name and address of the dispenser, the serial number and date of the prescription or of its filling, the name of the prescriber and, if stated in the prescription, the name of the patient, and the directions for use and the cautionary statements, if any, contained in such prescription.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. (1) A drug which is subject to paragraph XI(1) of this section shall be deemed to be misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing, its label fails to bear the statement "Caution:  Federal Law Prohibits Dispensing Without Prescription'', or "Caution:  State Law Prohibits Dispensing Without Prescription''.  A drug to which paragraph XI(1) of this section does not apply shall be deemed to be misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing its label bears the caution statement quoted in the preceding sentence.  (2) The commissioner may, by regulation, remove drugs subject to paragraph IV from the requirements of paragraph XI(1) of this section when such requirements are not necessary for the protection of the public health.  Drugs removed from the prescription requirements of the federal act by regulations issued thereunder may also, by regulations issued by the commissioner, be removed from the requirements of paragraph XI(1).  (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirements prescribed by or under authority of RSA 318-A.

XIII. If it is a color additive, the intended use of which in or on drugs is for the purpose of coloring only, unless its packaging and labeling are in conformity with such packaging and labeling requirements applicable to such color additives prescribed under the provisions of the federal act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. If it is, or purports to be, or is represented as a drug composed wholly or partly of insulin, unless it is a batch with respect to which a certificate or release has been issued pursuant to section 506 of the federal act, and such certificate or release is in effect with respect to such drug.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. If it is, or purports to be, or is represented as a drug composed wholly or partly of any kind of penicillin, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, chloramphenicol, or bacitracin, or any other antibiotic drug, or any derivative thereof, unless it is from a batch with respect to which a certificate or release has been issued pursuant to section 507 of the federal act, and such certificate or release is in effect with the respect to such drug:  provided, that this paragraph shall not apply to any drug or class of drugs exempted by regulations promulgated under section 507(c) or (d) of the federal act.  For the purpose of this paragraph the term "antibiotic drug'' means any drug intended for use by man containing any quantity of any chemical substance which is produced by a microorganism and which has the capacity to inhibit or destroy microorganism in dilute solution (including the chemically synthesized equivalent of any such substance).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146:20 Authority to Embargo and Condemn. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever a duly authorized agent of the department of health and human services finds or has probable cause to believe that any food, drug, device or cosmetic is adulterated, or so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent, within the meaning of this chapter, he shall affix to such article a tag or other appropriate marking, giving notice that such article is, or is suspected of being, adulterated or misbranded and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not to remove or dispose of such article by sale or otherwise until permission for removal or disposal is given by such agent or the court.  It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or dispose of such detained or embargoed article by sale or otherwise without such permission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When an article detained or embargoed under paragraph I has been found by such agent to be adulterated, or misbranded, he shall petition the courts in whose jurisdiction the article is detained or embargoed for a libel for condemnation of such article.  When such agent has found that an article so detained or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded, he shall remove the tag or other marking.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the court finds that a detained or embargoed article is adulterated or misbranded, such article shall, after entry of the decree, be destroyed at the expense of the claimant thereof, under the supervision of such agent, and all court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be taxed against the claimant of such article or his agent:  provided, that when the adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling, or processing of the article, the court, after entry of the decree and after such costs, fees, and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond, conditioned that such article shall be so labeled or processed, has been executed, may by order direct that such article be delivered to the claimant thereof for such labeling or processing under the supervision of an agent of the department of health and human services.  The expense of such supervision shall be paid by the claimant.  Such bond shall be returned to the claimant of the article on representation to the court by the commissioner that the article is no longer in violation of this chapter, and that the expenses of such supervision have been paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Whenever the department of health and human services or any of its authorized agents shall find in any vehicle, room, building, or other structure, any meat, seafood, poultry, vegetable, fruit or other perishable articles which are unsound, or contain any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or that may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe, the same being hereby declared to be a nuisance, the commissioner, or his authorized agent, shall forthwith condemn and destroy the same.
