<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For proceedings under RSA 135-C:27-33, jurisdiction is vested in the district court of the city or town where the person is detained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For proceedings under RSA 135-C:34-54, jurisdiction is vested in the probate court in the county where the person sought to be admitted resides or is detained.  For a client who is subject to an order for involuntary admission under this chapter, jurisdiction for a hearing held pursuant to this chapter is vested in the probate court for the county where the receiving facility that has been treating the client most recently is located, unless the court making the initial involuntary admission order has specifically retained jurisdiction over such person.
