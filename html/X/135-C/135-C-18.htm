<codesect>
Any program or facility in the mental health services system may at any time terminate or suspend services to the client when the termination or suspension is in the best interests of the client or when the client cannot benefit from the service.  Services may also be terminated or suspended if the client endangers or threatens to endanger other clients or staff.  A reasonable notice shall be given to the client or guardian, stating the effective date of the termination or suspension, the reasons for the termination or suspension, and the right to appeal the termination or suspension decision.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to termination or suspension criteria and procedures for administrative appeals.
