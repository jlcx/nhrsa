&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-C:17 Restriction on Withdrawal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If a client admitted to a receiving facility on a voluntary basis informs the facility of his desire to withdraw completely from the facility, the administrator of the facility or his designee may order a mental and physical examination of the client to determine whether the criteria for involuntary emergency admission in RSA 135-C:27-33 are met.  In such instances, the withdrawal of the client from the facility may be restricted for a period not to exceed 24 hours.  If the physician conducting the examination determines that the criteria for involuntary emergency admission are not met or if no examination has occurred within the 24-hour period, the client shall be released immediately.  Otherwise, the client shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of RSA 135-C:27-33.
