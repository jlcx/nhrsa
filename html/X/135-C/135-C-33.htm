&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any time during the period of involuntary emergency admission the administrator of the receiving facility or designee in such facility shall discharge the person admitted if the administrator decides that the person no longer meets the criteria established by RSA 135-C:27.  If a discharge occurs, under this section or pursuant to a finding of no probable cause by the court, the receiving facility shall, with the consent of the person admitted, return such person to the place where the person resided at the time the petition and physician's certificate were completed and signed.  Unless the discharge is pursuant to a finding of no probable cause by the court, the receiving facility shall give notice of the discharge to the community mental health program in the region from which the person was admitted and to the community mental health program in the region to which the person is being discharged.  The person discharged or the person's guardian shall be given written notice of such action taken by the receiving facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The petition, police record, transport request, and medical record established as a result of the involuntary emergency admission shall remain with the accepting agency and shall only be released upon informed written consent of the individual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The receiving facility shall either arrange the transportation within 24 hours of such notice or shall be liable for the cost of such transportation.
