The person sought to be admitted may, in writing, waive the probable cause hearing required under this section.  Such waiver shall state that the person sought to be admitted has made an informed decision to waive the probable cause hearing and that he or she understands that such a waiver shall result in his or her admission on an emergency basis for a period not to exceed 10 days, not including Saturdays and Sundays, except as specified in RSA 135-C:32.  The waiver shall be executed before a justice of any district or municipal court.

If medication is given to the person sought to be admitted prior to the probable cause hearing, it shall be the affirmative obligation of the physician prescribing the medication to advise the district court of the nature of the medication, the reason for it, and its probable effect upon the person.  Such notice may be transmitted to the court in writing prior to the hearing or may be presented by the physician at the hearing.  The jurisdiction for the probable cause hearing shall be in the district court in the city or town where the person is detained.

A receiving facility may transfer a person admitted under RSA 135-C:27-33 to another receiving facility if that receiving facility can better provide the degree of security and treatment required for the person.  All transfers shall receive prior approval of the chief administrator of the state mental health services system.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to transfer criteria and procedures for the challenge of transfer decisions by the persons to be transferred.">
