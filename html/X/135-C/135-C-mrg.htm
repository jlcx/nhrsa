<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Prevent mentally ill persons from harming themselves or others.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is the policy of this state to provide to persons who are severely mentally disabled adequate and humane care which, to the extent possible while meeting the purposes of habilitation and treatment, is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Within each person's own community.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Least restrictive of the person's freedom of movement and ability to function normally in society while being appropriate to the person's individual capacity.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Directed toward eliminating the need for services and promoting the person's independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h3>Section 135-C:27</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-C:27 Involuntary Emergency Admission;  Criteria. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A person shall be eligible for involuntary emergency admission if he is in such mental condition as a result of mental illness to pose a likelihood of danger to himself or others.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As used in this section "danger to himself'' is established by demonstrating that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Within 40 days of the completion of the petition, the person has inflicted serious bodily injury on himself or has attempted suicide or serious self-injury and there is a likelihood the act or attempted act will recur if admission is not ordered;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 40 days of the completion of the petition, the person has threatened to inflict serious bodily injury on himself and there is likelihood that an act or attempt of serious self-injury will occur if admission is not ordered;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person's behavior demonstrates that he so lacks the capacity to care for his own welfare that there is a likelihood of death, serious bodily injury, or serious debilitation if admission is not ordered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The person meets all of the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The person has been determined to be severely mentally disabled in accordance with rules authorized by RSA 135-C:61 for a period of at least one year;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The person has had at least one involuntary admission, within the last 2 years, pursuant to RSA 135-C:34-54;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The person has no guardian of the person appointed pursuant to RSA 464-A;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The person is not subject to a conditional discharge granted pursuant to RSA 135-C:49, II;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The person has refused the treatment determined necessary by a mental health program approved by the department;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A psychiatrist at a mental health program approved by the department has determined, based upon the person's clinical history, that there is a substantial probability that the person's refusal to accept necessary treatment will lead to death, serious bodily injury, or serious debilitation if admission is not ordered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. As used in this section "danger to others'' is established by demonstrating that within 40 days of the completion of the petition, the person has inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-C:28 Involuntary Emergency Admission Examination. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The involuntary emergency admission of a person shall be to the state mental health services system under the supervision of the commissioner.  The admission may be ordered upon the certificate of a physician or APRN, as defined in RSA 135-C:2, II-a, who is approved by either a designated receiving facility or a community mental health program approved by the commissioner, provided that within 3 days of the completion of the petition the physician or APRN has conducted, or has caused to be conducted, a physical examination if indicated and circumstances permit, and a mental examination.  The physician or APRN must find that the person to be admitted meets the criteria of RSA 135-C:27.  The certificate shall state the time and, in detail, the nature of the examinations conducted.  The certificate shall also state a specific act or actions the physician or APRN has actually observed or which have been reported to him or her by the petitioner or a reliable witness who shall be identified in the certificate, and which in the physician's or APRN's opinion satisfy the criteria set forth in RSA 135-C:27.  The physician or APRN shall identify in the certificate the facility in the state mental health services system to which the person shall be admitted.  The admission shall be made to the facility which can best provide the degree of security and treatment required by the person and shall be consistent with the placement principles set forth in RSA 135-C:15.  As used in RSA 135-C:27-33, "petitioner'' means any individual, including a physician or APRN completing a certificate, who has requested that a physician or APRN conduct or who has conducted an examination for purposes of involuntary emergency admission.  Every certificate shall be accompanied by a written petition signed by a petitioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon request for involuntary emergency admission by a petitioner, if the person sought to be admitted refuses to consent to a mental examination, a petitioner or a law enforcement officer may sign a complaint which shall be sworn to before a justice of the peace.  The complaint shall be submitted to the justice of the peace with the petition.  The petition shall state in detail the acts or actions of the person sought to be admitted which the petitioner has personally observed or which have been personally reported to the petitioner and in his or her opinion require a compulsory mental examination.  If the justice of the peace finds that a compulsory mental examination is necessary, the justice may order the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a peace officer observes a person engaging in behavior which gives the peace officer reasonable suspicion to believe that the person may be suffering from a mental illness and probable cause to believe that unless the person is placed in protective custody the person poses an immediate danger of bodily injury to himself or others, the police officer may place the person in protective custody.  Any person taken into protective custody under this paragraph shall be transported directly to an emergency room of a licensed general hospital or to another site designated by the community mental health program serving the area, for the purpose of determining if an involuntary emergency admission shall be ordered in accordance with RSA 135-C:28, I. The period of protective custody shall end when a physician or APRN makes a determination as to whether involuntary emergency admission shall be ordered or at the end of 6 hours, whichever event occurs first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-C:31 Involuntary Emergency Admission Hearing;  Rules. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Within 3 days after an involuntary emergency admission, not including Sundays and holidays, and subject to the notice requirements of RSA 135-C:24, there shall be a probable cause hearing in the district court having jurisdiction to determine if there was probable cause for involuntary emergency admission.  The burden shall be on the petitioner to show that probable cause existed.  The court shall render its written decision as soon as possible after the close of the hearing, but not later than the end of the court's next regular business day.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The person sought to be admitted or the petitioner may request a continuance of the probable cause hearing.  Such requests shall be granted only for good cause but in no case shall continuance be granted for more than 2 days.  Any continuance granted for good cause shall not extend the period of involuntary emergency admission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The person sought to be admitted may, in writing, waive the probable cause hearing required under this section.  Such waiver shall state that the person sought to be admitted has made an informed decision to waive the probable cause hearing and that he or she understands that such a waiver shall result in his or her admission on an emergency basis for a period not to exceed 10 days, not including Saturdays and Sundays, except as specified in RSA 135-C:32.  The waiver shall be executed before a justice of any district or municipal court.  If the person sought to be admitted is found by the court to be incapable of making an informed decision to waive probable cause, then the waiver may be executed by that person's attorney subject to the review of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For 48 hours prior to the hearing the person sought to be admitted shall not be given medication or treatment that would adversely affect his judgment or limit his ability to prepare for the hearing unless the person sought to be admitted makes an informed decision to consent to treatment or unless a medical or psychiatric emergency exists.  If medication is given to the person sought to be admitted prior to the probable cause hearing, it shall be the affirmative obligation of the physician prescribing the medication to advise the district court of the nature of the medication, the reason for it, and its probable effect upon the person.  Such notice may be transmitted to the court in writing prior to the hearing or may be presented by the physician at the hearing.  The jurisdiction for the probable cause hearing shall be in the district court in the city or town where the person is detained.  Upon the request of the person sought to be admitted or that person's attorney, a change of venue or transfer may be granted for good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a receiving facility has not been designated to receive or maintain custody following a probable cause hearing of a person admitted under RSA 135-C:27-33, the facility shall, within 24 hours, transfer the person to a receiving facility which has the proper designation.  A receiving facility may transfer a person admitted under RSA 135-C:27-33 to another receiving facility if that receiving facility can better provide the degree of security and treatment required for the person.  All transfers shall receive prior approval of the chief administrator of the state mental health services system.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to transfer criteria and procedures for the challenge of transfer decisions by the persons to be transferred.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-C:43 Conduct of Hearing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For hearings held under this chapter, the person sought to be admitted shall have the right to legal counsel, to present evidence on his or her own behalf, to have a closed hearing and a closed file unless he or she requests otherwise, and to cross-examine witnesses.  He or she shall also have the right to summon as a witness the psychiatrist who filed the report pursuant to RSA 135-C:40 and to cross-examine him or her.  A transcript, which may consist only of any audio recording of the proceedings, and at the court's discretion, shall be made of the entire proceeding.  The transcript may serve as the basis for an appeal and the costs of the transcript shall be apportioned, within the judge's discretion, between the state and the person sought to be admitted.  The transcript or recording shall be retained by the court for 2 years or until official notice is received of discharge, if the person is admitted on an involuntary basis and subsequently discharged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the court determines that involuntary admission to a receiving facility is necessary, the court, at the nonemergency involuntary admission hearing, shall determine if the psychiatric evaluation performed by the psychiatrist designated by the court shall be available to the designated receiving facility, as defined in RSA 135-C:26, or the secure psychiatric unit.  Before the court determines whether to provide the psychiatric evaluation to the designated receiving facility or to the secure psychiatric unit, the court shall provide the person sought to be admitted with an opportunity to object.  The court shall consider the person's privacy interest in the content of the psychiatric evaluation and the receiving facility's or the secure psychiatric unit's need to review the psychiatric evaluation for purposes of treatment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-C:45 Order of Court. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In hearings held under this chapter, after hearing all the evidence, the court may order the respondent to be released, notwithstanding expert testimony, or it may order the person to submit to some form of treatment other than inpatient treatment on an involuntary basis, which may include treatment at a community mental health program approved by the commissioner.  If the examining psychiatrist recommends involuntary admission to a receiving facility as the most desirable form of treatment, the court may so order.  The court may furnish a copy of the psychiatric evaluation, pursuant to RSA 135-C:43, II, performed by the psychiatrist designated by the court to the designated receiving facility, as defined in RSA 135-C:26, or the secure psychiatric unit.  If the court determines that involuntary admission to a receiving facility is necessary, but the examining psychiatrist finds otherwise in his report under RSA 135-C:40, the court may overrule the recommendation of the psychiatrist only after the court finds that treatment other than involuntary admission to a receiving facility would not be in the best interests of the person and the community.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In any order of admission to a receiving facility, the court shall include in the duration of said order an appropriate period of time, if any, to allow for conditional discharge.  Admission for purposes of conditional discharge shall be appropriate when the person has recovered from his mental illness to such an extent that he no longer requires inpatient treatment but a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment is necessary to prevent the recurrence of the circumstances which led to the person's dangerous condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the respondent is on a conditional discharge at the time of the hearing, the court may order involuntary admission to a receiving facility, or renew such an order, for the purpose of permitting the respondent to remain on conditional discharge if such treatment is necessary to prevent the recurrence of the circumstances which led to the person's dangerous condition.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-C:45-a Appointment of Limited Guardian. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In any case in which the petition includes a request for appointment of a guardian, the court shall also determine whether to appoint a guardian over the person for the purpose of providing health care.  There shall be a legal presumption of capacity, and the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent is incapacitated and in need of a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At the hearing, the court shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Inquire into the nature and extent of the functional limitations of the respondent;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Ascertain his or her capacity to care for himself or herself with respect to his or her health care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If it is determined that the respondent possesses the capacity to care for himself or herself regarding health care, then the court shall deny the request for appointment of a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Alternatively, the court may appoint a guardian of the person with respect to health care as requested in the petition and confer specific powers of guardianship on the proposed guardian after finding in the record based on evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person for whom a guardian is to be appointed is incapacitated;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The guardianship is necessary as a means of providing appropriate health care for the incapacitated person;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) There are no available alternative resources which are suitable with respect to the incapacitated person's welfare, safety, and rehabilitation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The guardianship is appropriate as the least restrictive form of intervention consistent with the preservation of the civil rights and liberties of the respondent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a guardian is appointed, letters of guardianship shall be issued, as provided in RSA 464-A:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Except as modified by order of the court, a guardian appointed under this chapter shall have the powers and duties set forth in RSA 464-A:25, I(d).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The provisions of RSA 464-A:10 shall govern who may be a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Upon appointment, the guardian shall give bond to the court as provided in RSA 464-A:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Compensation to the guardian shall be allowed as provided in RSA 464-A:23.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The provisions of RSA 464-A:24 shall govern the appointment of agents by guardians.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The guardian shall file biennial reports as provided in RSA 464-A:35, give annual notice to the ward as provided in RSA 464-A:38, file a final accounting report as provided in RSA 464-A:40, and be subject to the provisions and sanctions of RSA 464-A:37 for failure to make or file any report within the time provided by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The provisions of RSA 464-A:39 shall govern the removal or resignation of the guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The guardian may at any time file a petition pursuant to RSA 464-A:4 for a finding of incapacity and expansion of his or her authority over the person or estate of the ward.  Such a proceeding shall be governed by the provisions of RSA 464-A.

II. The court issuing an order for inpatient treatment at a receiving facility may retain jurisdiction of the case for the duration of the order.  The court may include in its order a provision requiring the petitioner or the receiving facility to show cause upon a date set by the court as to why the person has not been granted a conditional discharge under RSA 135-C:50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At such a proceeding, the burden shall be upon the petitioner or the receiving facility to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that either:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a psychiatrist or APRN, as defined in RSA 135-C:2, II-a, at a community mental health program providing continuing treatment on an outpatient basis to a person conditionally discharged pursuant to RSA 135-C:50, reasonably believes that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person has violated a condition of the discharge;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A condition or circumstance exists which may create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to the person or to others, the psychiatrist or APRN may conduct or cause to be conducted by a treatment team member or an emergency service staff member, an examination of the person to determine if the conditional discharge should be revoked.  Before an examination may be conducted, a written notice identifying the belief, and the reasons therefor, that a violation of the conditional discharge has occurred or other circumstances or condition exists which may create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to the person or to others shall be offered to and explained to the person if it can be done safely without significant possibility of bodily harm.  If this cannot be done safely, a description of the circumstances indicating such risk shall be placed in the file.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A reasonable effort shall be made to find the person, in order to offer and explain the notice required under paragraph I if it can be done safely without significant possibility of bodily harm.  If this cannot be done safely, a description of the circumstances indicating such risk shall be placed in the file.  If the person cannot be located or consent to an examination cannot be obtained, the psychiatrist or other representative of the community mental health program may sign a complaint.  Upon issuance of such a complaint, any law enforcement officer shall take custody of the person and immediately deliver him or her to the place specified in the complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the psychiatrist or APRN, following the examination the psychiatrist or APRN conducted or caused to be conducted of the person, finds that the person either has violated a condition of the discharge or is in such a mental condition as a result of mental illness as to create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to himself or herself or to others, he or she may temporarily revoke the conditional discharge.  If the conditional discharge is temporarily revoked, the psychiatrist, or APRN, or designee, shall prepare, offer to and explain to the person a written notice, if it can be done safely without significant possibility of bodily harm, giving the reasons for the revocation and to identify the receiving facility to which the person is to be delivered.  If this cannot be done safely, a description of the circumstances indicating such risk shall be placed in the file.

A law enforcement officer shall take custody of the person whose conditional discharge was temporarily revoked under paragraph III and deliver him or her, together with a copy of the notice and the reasons for the temporary revocation, to the receiving facility identified by the psychiatrist or APRN, where he or she shall be personally examined by the administrator of the facility or designee and the reasons for temporary revocation of the discharge shall be reviewed.  Following such examination and review, if the administrator of the facility or designee finds that the person conditionally discharged has violated a condition of the discharge or is in such a mental condition as a result of mental illness as to create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to himself or herself or to others, he or she may revoke absolutely the conditional discharge.  The administrator of the facility, or designee, shall prepare, offer to and explain to the person, if it can be done safely without significant possibility of bodily harm, a written notice of the reasons for the absolute revocation.  If this cannot be done safely, a description of the circumstances indicating such risk shall be placed in the file.  The person whose conditional discharge has been absolutely revoked shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the order of involuntary admission made pursuant to RSA 135-C:34-54 from which conditional discharge was granted as if the conditional discharge had not been granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. All explanations provided pursuant to this section shall be sufficiently detailed and complete to inform the person of the reasons for the revocation and that he or she has a right to a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the psychiatrist who conducted or caused to be conducted an examination under paragraph III, or the administrator of the facility, or a qualified designee, performing an examination and review pursuant to paragraph IV finds that the person conditionally discharged either has not violated a condition of the discharge or is not in such a condition as a result of mental illness as to create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to himself or others, the person shall be returned by the program or facility which has custody of the person to the location where he was initially taken into custody.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A person conditionally discharged pursuant to RSA 135-C:50 may be admitted to a receiving facility by an involuntary emergency admission under RSA 135-C:27-33.  In such cases, the finding of probable cause for involuntary emergency admission by the district court pursuant to RSA 135-C:31, I, shall authorize the person's admission for no longer than a 10-day period, as provided in RSA 135-C:32, unless during the period of involuntary emergency admission the person's conditional discharge is absolutely revoked.  No absolute revocation of conditional discharge shall be made pursuant to this section unless the administrator of the facility or his or her qualified designee personally examines the individual and finds that the person conditionally discharged has violated a condition of the discharge or is in such a mental condition as a result of mental illness so as to create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to himself or to others.  If a person's conditional discharge is absolutely revoked pursuant to this section, the person shall receive notice of the reasons for the absolute revocation and shall have a right to appeal as provided in RSA 135-C:52.
