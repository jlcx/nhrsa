I. Upon completion of an involuntary emergency admission certificate under RSA 135-C:28, any law enforcement officer shall, except as provided in paragraph II, take custody of the person to be admitted and immediately deliver him to the receiving facility identified in the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The physician shall consult with the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a child subject to involuntary emergency admission regarding available transportation alternatives.  If the physician determines that the child does not require the degree of security provided by a law enforcement vehicle, the physician may, with the consent of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, authorize an ambulance service or other medical vehicle to deliver the child to the receiving facility.
