Whenever it appears to the commissioner that a client in the mental health services system by reason of mental illness is substantially deprived of his capacity to manage his own affairs and is at risk of substantial harm to person or estate as a result, and the client does not have a legal guardian, the commissioner shall take such steps as are appropriate to safeguard the client as may be consistent with RSA 464-A and RSA 547-B, including the nomination of a guardian when no less restrictive alternative is available.
