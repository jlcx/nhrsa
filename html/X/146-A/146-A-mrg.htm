<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Containment of the discharged oil;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Cleanup and restoration of the site and surrounding environment, and corrective measures as defined under RSA 146-A:11-a, III(a) and (b);  and

I-a. (a) Any operator or person who has legal ownership of real property upon which underground storage facilities or other petroleum storage facilities which are not in compliance with the requirements of RSA 146-A or RSA 146-C are located shall be strictly liable for the costs of removal.  The department shall have a lien upon the real property for all costs incurred by the department in removing underground storage facilities or other petroleum storage facilities pursuant to RSA 146-A:11-a, III(f) from the real property, including interest calculated pursuant to RSA 336:1, II where such costs are not paid as prescribed by the department.  Such lien shall arise at the time such costs are incurred by the department and shall continue until the liability for such costs, including interest is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.  The lien shall become valid and effective against the real property upon the department's recordation of a notice of lien in the registry of deeds for the county in which the real property is located.  The notice of lien shall identify the legal owner of record by name and address, the location of the real estate from which the facility was removed by the department, and the amount of the lien.  The department shall send a copy of the notice of lien to the person identified in the notice at the address set forth in the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.  There shall be no charge for filing the department's notice of lien.  The fee for discharging the notice of lien shall be borne by the person identified in the notice of lien.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
