<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The general court finds that gasoline and diesel fuel, due to their extreme fluidity and suspected carcinogenic qualities, comprise a sufficiently distinct class of property which represents a potential serious health and safety problem to the citizens of New Hampshire.  In particular, gasoline and diesel fuel present a potential threat to the quality of New Hampshire's groundwater and environment because of the speed with which these products are able to flow into, and contaminate, valuable groundwater supplies.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish financial responsibility for the cleanup of oil discharge and disposal, and to establish a fund to be used in addressing the costs incurred by the owners of underground storage facilities and bulk storage facilities for the cleanup of oil discharge and disposal, to protect groundwater, and for reimbursement for third party damages.  An additional purpose is to provide a funding source for cleanup and reimbursement for discharges of gasoline ethers pursuant to RSA 146-G.  The fund established under this chapter shall be in addition to the oil pollution control fund established pursuant to RSA 146-A:11-a, and the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund established under RSA 146-G.
