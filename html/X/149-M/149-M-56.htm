The department is hereby authorized to participate in the establishment and implementation of a regional, multi-state clearinghouse to assist in carrying out the requirements of this subdivision and to help coordinate reviews of the manufacturers' notifications regarding mercury-added products, applications for phase-out exemptions, reviews of the collection plans, the disclosures of mercury content, applications for alternative labeling, and education and outreach.  The clearinghouse may also maintain a list of all products containing mercury, including mercury-added products;  a file on all exemptions granted by the states;  and a file of all the manufacturers' reports on the effectiveness of their collection systems.
