I. (a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b), no person shall sell or offer for sale in New Hampshire an alkaline manganese battery manufactured on or after January 1, 1993, which battery contains more than 0.025 percent mercury by weight of the battery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No person shall sell or offer for sale in New Hampshire alkaline manganese batteries having sizes and shapes resembling buttons or coins which have a mercury content of more than 25 milligrams of mercury per battery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A manufacturer shall not sell, distribute, or offer for sale in this state an alkaline manganese battery, except an alkaline manganese button cell, that contains added mercury, unless the commissioner grants an exemption pursuant to paragraph II of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) On application by a manufacturer, the commissioner may exempt a manufacturer from the requirements of subparagraph I(c) if the manufacturer demonstrates that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Since July 11, 1992, the manufacturer has worked in good faith to develop mercury-free alkaline manganese batteries which, with respect to safety, leakage, capacity, rate capability and shelf life, are as good as alkaline manganese batteries containing no more than 0.025 percent mercury produced by that manufacturer on January 1, 1993;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If granted that exemption, the manufacturer shall continue to work in good faith to achieve the goals described in subparagraph (a)(1).

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No person shall sell or offer for sale in this state any consumer product manufactured after July 1, 1993, which is powered by a small, sealed, nickel-cadmium or small, sealed, lead acid battery unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The battery can be easily removed by the consumer or is contained in a battery pack that is separate from the product and can be easily removed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such product, the package containing such product, or the battery itself is clearly labeled in a manner which is visible and understandable to the consumer prior to purchase indicating that the battery must be recycled or disposed of properly.
