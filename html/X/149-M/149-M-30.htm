Considerations for determining priority for eligibility to incur debt in the form of bonds guaranteed by the state of New Hampshire for solid waste landfill closure and cleanup of hazardous waste sites shall be as follows, in order of highest to lowest priority:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Facility poses immediate risk to human health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Facility poses potential risk to human health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Facility with high level source of contamination identified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Facility with surface water impact identified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Facilities with approved closure plans ready for construction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Facilities with closure plans that have been deemed complete.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Facilities for which hydrogeological investigations have been completed in accordance with an approved workscope and which have obtained a groundwater management permit and are actively engaged in the final design of the closure system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) Facility shows groundwater impact with no alternate water supply in area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) Facility shows high concentration of groundwater contamination with alternate water supply in area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) Facility shows low concentration of groundwater contamination with alternate water supply available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Project priority may be adjusted by the commissioner when such adjustments are determined to be required to further protect public health and the environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the amount of bonds authorized in a given year exceeds the annual bond limit, the commissioner shall recommend allocation of the bond guarantees based on the priority ranking system under paragraph I.
