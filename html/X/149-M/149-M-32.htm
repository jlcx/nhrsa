<codesect>
The general court finds that the presence of heavy metals in packaging is to be considered a matter of concern in connection with the overall solid waste stream because such metals are likely to be present in leachate when packaging is landfilled or in emissions when packaging is incinerated.  The general court further finds that lead, cadmium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium, on the basis of available scientific and medical evidence, are of particular concern and that elimination of the addition of these heavy metals to packaging is a desirable first step in reducing the toxicity of packaging waste.  Further, the general court finds that such a reduction in the toxicity of packaging waste should be accomplished without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of recycled materials in the production of packaging and its components.
