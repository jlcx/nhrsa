<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Estimate the types, weights, and volumes of solid waste generated, including wet-cell batteries, used motor oil, tires, demolition debris, and waste particular to the district or municipality, current and available methods of disposal and treatment, and the types, weights, and volume of recyclable materials that can be recovered and recycled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Develop future projections of the types, weights, and volumes of waste generated, and the types and amounts of solid waste materials that can be recovered and recycled based on current and future population growth trends.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Identify numbers, types, and capacities of operating facilities in the district or town in compliance with this chapter, and the location, type, and capacity of any proposed facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Establish a process by which those facilities with known or suspected groundwater contamination or emission problems can develop a remedial action plan, including funding requirements and funding mechanisms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Demonstrate a capacity or implementation plan for disposal for 10 years and an ongoing planning process as required in RSA 149-M:23 for 15 years from the date of filing of the plan.  Each such plan shall be reviewed by the department at least once every 5 years from the date of submission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Identify the means by which district members shall develop, construct, operate, or otherwise implement the solid waste management methods described in the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each plan shall be reviewed and commented upon by the department.  The department or a district or town may request a hearing on the plan as submitted.  The department may approve, require modification of, or disapprove of any plan with cause stated and shall finally act upon each plan within 120 days of submission.  Within 60 days after receipt of written notice of approval of the plan by the department, the town or district and each town in the district shall begin implementing the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
