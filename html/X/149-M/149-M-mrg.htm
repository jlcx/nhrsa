&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 149-M:2 Waste Reduction Goal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court declares its concern that there are environmental and economic issues pertaining to the disposal of solid waste in landfills and incinerators.  It is important to reserve landfill and incinerator capacity for solid wastes which cannot be reduced, reused, recycled or composted.  The general court declares that the goal of the state, by the year 2000, is to achieve a 40 percent minimum weight diversion of solid waste landfilled or incinerated on a per capita basis.  Diversion shall be measured with respect to changes in waste generated and subsequently landfilled or incinerated in New Hampshire.  The goal of weight diversion may be achieved through source reduction, recycling, reuse, and composting, or any combination of such methods.  The general court discourages the disposal of recyclable materials in landfills or processing of recyclable materials in incinerators.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In exercising any and all powers conferred upon the department under this chapter, the department shall use and consider criteria relevant to the waste reduction goal and disposal hierarchy established in RSA 149-M:2 and 149-M:3.  The department shall not take any action relative to the 40 percent weight reduction goal which causes the municipalities organized under RSA 53-A and 1986, 139 or RSA 53-B to violate or incur penalties under legal obligations existing on June 26, 1990.

<center><h3>Section 149-M:11</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 149-M:11 Public Benefit Requirement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds and declares as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It is responsible to provide for the solid waste management need of the state and its citizens.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In order to provide for these needs, it must ensure that adequate capacity exists within the state to accommodate the solid waste generated within the borders of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Facilities necessary to meet state solid waste capacity needs must be designed and operated in a manner which will protect the public health and the state's natural environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An integrated system of solid waste management requires a variety of types of facilities designed to accommodate the entire solid waste stream, including materials which can be recycled, recovered or reused, materials which can be composted, and residual materials which must be disposed of permanently.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The enactment of statutes to address the needs identified in this section is an exercise of the police power granted to the general court under part II, article 5 of the New Hampshire Constitution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court declares that it is the purpose of this chapter to ensure benefit to the citizens of New Hampshire by providing for solid waste management options which will meet the capacity needs of the state while minimizing adverse environmental, public health and long-term economic impacts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department shall determine whether a proposed solid waste facility provides a substantial public benefit based upon the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The short- and long-term need for a solid waste facility of the proposed type, size, and location to provide capacity to accommodate solid waste generated within the borders of New Hampshire, which capacity need shall be identified as provided in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The ability of the proposed facility to assist the state in achieving the implementation of the hierarchy and goals under RSA 149-M:2 and RSA 149-M:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The ability of the proposed facility to assist in achieving the goals of the state solid waste management plan, and one or more solid waste management plans submitted to and approved by the department under RSA 149-M:24 and RSA 149-M:25.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall also consider as part of its public benefit determination:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The concerns of the citizens and governing bodies of the host municipality, county, and district and other affected persons.  For any proposed solid waste facility, including transfer stations, designed to accommodate in excess of 30 tons of solid waste per day, the department shall hold at least one public hearing in the host municipality, or in the case of an unincorporated town or unorganized place in the host county, in order to take testimony to identify those concerns.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The economic viability of the proposed facility, including but not limited to, its ability to secure financing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In order to determine the state's solid waste capacity need, the department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Project, as necessary, the amount of solid waste which will be generated within the borders of New Hampshire for a 20-year planning period.  In making these projections the department shall assume that all unlined landfill capacity within the state is no longer available to receive solid waste.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Identify the types of solid waste which can be managed according to each of the methods listed under RSA 149-M:3 and determine which such types will be received by the proposed facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Identify, according to type of solid waste received, all permitted facilities operating in the state on the date a determination is made under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Identify any shortfall in the capacity of existing facilities to accommodate the type of solid waste to be received at the proposed facility for 20 years from the date a determination is made under this section.  If such a shortfall is identified, a capacity need for the proposed type of facility shall be deemed to exist to the extent that the proposed facility satisfies that need.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All applicants under this chapter shall provide any information requested by the department.  If an applicant declares that any information requested under this section should be considered exempt under RSA 91-A:5, IV, the attorney general shall determine the reasonableness of such declaration and, if the attorney general agrees, shall direct the department to treat it as confidential information which shall be considered exempt under RSA 91-A:5, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any proposed solid waste facility to be owned and controlled by a solid waste district, or a member municipality on behalf of its solid waste district, shall be deemed to fulfill the requirements of subparagraph III(a), provided that it is built within the district and shall serve only the capacity needs of that district.  Any permit issued for a facility which fulfills the public benefit requirement by relying on this paragraph shall state that the facility is limited to receiving solid waste generated within that district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Each applicant for a solid waste permit under this chapter shall have the burden of demonstrating that a proposed solid waste facility provides a public benefit by showing how the proposed facility satisfies the criteria listed under paragraph III.  Such demonstration shall be included as part of each application for a solid waste permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the department determines that an applicant has failed to demonstrate that it satisfies the criteria listed under paragraph III, it shall notify the applicant in writing that its application has been denied, and provide a written explanation of the reasons for that determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If the department determines that an applicant has demonstrated that it satisfies the criteria listed under paragraph III, it shall state that determination in any permit issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Facilities permitted under this chapter shall be operated so as to provide a substantial public benefit consistent with the information submitted as part of the application concerning how the facility accommodates New Hampshire capacity needs.  If a permittee cannot demonstrate consistency with information submitted in its permit application, and where it no longer meets needs identified in the state solid waste management plan and one or more solid waste management plans submitted to and approved by the department under RSA 149-M:25 due to circumstances beyond its control, as determined by the commissioner and the attorney general, the department shall not enforce this paragraph based solely upon such inconsistency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 149-M:14 Forfeiture of Property. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any property, including, but not limited to, equipment, vehicles, and real property used or intended for use in violation of this chapter, and any property constituting the proceeds of a violation of this chapter, including, but not limited to, money, may be seized by the state and forfeited to the state as provided in this section.  Property seized under this section may be held by the state either as evidence of a violation of this chapter or in order to secure it prior to forfeiture proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state may seize any interest in real property by filing in the registry of deeds in the county where the property is located a notice of attachment stating that the state has attached the identified property pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state shall have a lien on any property subject to forfeiture under this section upon seizure of such property.  Upon forfeiture the state's title to the property relates back to the date of seizure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 30 days of the seizure of any property under paragraph I, the attorney general shall file a petition in the superior court of the county in which the property was seized, requesting forfeiture of the property.  The court shall issue an order of notice requiring the state to send by certified mail a copy of the petition to the owner of the property and to other persons appearing to have an interest in the property.  If no such petition is filed within 30 days of the seizure of the property, that property shall be returned to its owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Within 30 days of receipt of the attorney general's petition for forfeiture, the court shall schedule a hearing.  This hearing shall be conducted as a civil action.  The court may order forfeiture of the property seized under paragraph I if the state establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that (a) the property was used or intended for use in violation of the chapter or that the property constitutes the proceeds of a violation of the chapter and (b) that the owner of the property knew or should have known that the property was used or intended for use in violation of the chapter or that the property constituted the proceeds of a violation of the chapter.  At the request of any party to the forfeiture proceedings, the court may grant a continuance until the final resolution of any proceedings which were brought against a party under this chapter and which arose from the transaction which gave rise to the forfeiture proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If forfeiture is granted, the attorney general shall provide for the disposition of the property forfeited in any manner not prohibited by law, including retention of the property for official use by law enforcement or other public agencies or by sale at public auction.  The attorney general shall pay the reasonable expenses of the seizure, forfeiture proceeding, and sale of property from the proceeds of any public auction of forfeited items or from any penalty obtained under this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 149-M:17 Town Responsibility and Authority. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each town shall either provide a facility or assure access to another approved solid waste facility for its residents.  A town may choose whether to include any associated costs in its tax base.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A town may make bylaws governing its facility and fixing reasonable rates for its use, and governing the separation and collection of refuse within the municipality and the registration of haulers collecting or disposing of refuse within the municipality, all in a manner not inconsistent with this chapter.  Furthermore, a town may make bylaws requiring residents to deposit their refuse in specifically designated bags or containers, or in bags or containers that have attached to them a disposal sticker.  Such bags, containers, or disposal stickers shall be sold or made available by the town at a reasonable price.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding RSA 31:39, III, towns are authorized to levy civil penalties up to $3,000 for each act which violates the bylaws enacted pursuant to this paragraph.  For violations for which any penalty provided in the bylaws is $500 or less, the official designated in the bylaws as the enforcement authority may issue a summons and notice of fine as provided in RSA 502-A:19-b, except that a copy of the fines for violations of the local bylaws shall be substituted for the uniform fine schedule.  Defendants who are issued such summons and notice of fine may plead guilty or nolo contendere by mail by entering a plea as provided in RSA 502-A:19-b.  If the plea is accepted by the court, the defendant shall not be required to appear unless directed by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each town which participates in a solid waste management system developed by a district plan shall present the full amount of its individual cost of participation to its legislative body for funding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A town may contract, upon a majority vote of its legislative body, with the owners or operators of solid waste disposal facilities for the disposal of solid waste.  Such contracts shall be for a term of years not to exceed 40 years.  The contracts may contain guarantees of the amount of solid waste to be delivered for disposal, provided that the contract is in keeping with the policy set forth in RSA 149-M:2 and 149-M:3.  In the event that a town's delivered tonnage falls below the level stipulated in contract, the town may procure tonnage from sources outside the town, in compliance with the public benefit requirements of RSA 149-M:11 and as provided in the contract.  Contracts may contain provisions for payments based on such guarantees whether or not any subject facility is actually constructed or is operated to dispose of solid waste, and may be absolute, without right of reduction or set-off because of non-appropriation by the town or default by the owner or operator.  Contracts may contain such other terms and conditions as the town may determine to be in its best interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A town may transfer, upon a majority vote of its legislative body, any land interest to the owner or operator of solid waste disposal facilities by deed or by lease of not more than 40 years.  Transfer and use of land interests for solid waste disposal facilities shall constitute a public purpose for which towns may acquire land interests in any manner permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A town which charges fees for the use of a solid waste facility, or for any other type of solid waste disposal services, including collection, hauling, separation, recycling, or composting, may bill such fees to the owner of the property where the solid waste originates, or which is otherwise benefited by such services, irrespective of whether the facility or other services are provided by the town, another town, a combination of towns, a district, or by a private operator with which the town, towns, or district have contracted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The establishment of such fees shall be governed by RSA 41:9-a, or other applicable statute or charter provision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such charges shall create a lien upon the benefited real estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A town may collect such charges by the use of any of the collection procedures authorized by RSA 38:22.  Interest on overdue charges shall be assessed in accordance with RSA 76:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a town from collecting charges for solid waste disposal services in some other manner, including but not limited to collection at the facility at the time of disposal.

<center><h2>Toxics Reduction</h2></center>

<center><h3>Section 149-M:32</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 149-M:32 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that the presence of heavy metals in packaging is to be considered a matter of concern in connection with the overall solid waste stream because such metals are likely to be present in leachate when packaging is landfilled or in emissions when packaging is incinerated.  The general court further finds that lead, cadmium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium, on the basis of available scientific and medical evidence, are of particular concern and that elimination of the addition of these heavy metals to packaging is a desirable first step in reducing the toxicity of packaging waste.  Further, the general court finds that such a reduction in the toxicity of packaging waste should be accomplished without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of recycled materials in the production of packaging and its components.
