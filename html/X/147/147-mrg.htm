<center><h3>Section 147:7-b</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 147:7-b Collection of Nuisance Abatement Costs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A municipality which has incurred costs for the removal or destruction of a public health nuisance pursuant to RSA 147:4-6, 147:11, 147:13, 147:17, or 147:17-a, may, as an alternative to a civil action to recover such costs, institute collection of such costs using the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After obtaining the consent of the municipal governing body, the health officer shall issue an order for costs, bearing the title "Order for Abatement Costs Pursuant to RSA 147:7-b'' containing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A copy of any notice or order sent pursuant to RSA 147:7-a and a statement that such notice or order was not complied with within the time specified;  or, in the case of removal without notice pursuant to RSA 147:6, a statement of what the nuisance or other danger to the public health was, and a statement of the circumstances justifying the removal without notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement of what corrective action was taken by the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An expense account of the municipality's costs in taking the corrective action, including the cost of issuing and serving orders under RSA 147:7-a and this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A statement that such costs constitute a lien against the real estate, enforceable in the same manner as real estate taxes, including possible loss of the property for nonpayment, and, if no written objection is filed with the health officer within 30 days, the account will be committed to the tax collector.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The address of the office of the health officer, where any objection must be filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A copy of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The order shall be served upon the record owner of the property or such owner's agent, and upon the person to whom taxes are assessed for the property, if other than the owner, in the same manner provided for service of a summons in a civil action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 30 days after such service, any person served may file a written objection with the health officer, stating with specificity the basis for the objection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If no such objection is filed, the health officer shall forward a copy of the order, together with proof of service and a certification that no objection was received, to the selectmen or other officers responsible in that municipality for issuing tax warrants under RSA 76:10.  The selectmen or other officers shall commit the expense account to the municipal tax collector, together with a warrant requiring the collector to collect the same from the person to whom real estate taxes are assessed for the premises upon which such corrective action was taken, and to pay the amount so collected to the municipal treasurer.  Within 30 days after the receipt of such warrant, the collector shall send a bill as provided in RSA 76:11.  Interest as provided in RSA 76:13 shall be charged on any amount not paid within 30 days after the bill is mailed.  The collector shall have the same rights and remedies as in the collection of taxes, as provided in RSA 80.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If an objection is filed, the health officer may file a motion to affirm the order in the district court of the district in which the property is located if the amount does not exceed the limits of the district court's civil damages concurrent jurisdiction as set forth in RSA 502-A:14, or otherwise in the superior court.  The filing shall include copies of the order and the objection.  The clerk shall schedule a hearing on the motion, and shall give notice of the hearing by registered mail upon the person filing the objection, at least 20 days prior to the hearing.  At the hearing, the technical rules of evidence shall not apply, but the court may admit any evidence deemed material and proper.  Following the hearing, or upon default, the court shall enter judgment affirming, correcting if necessary, or denying the order for abatement costs.  If the order is affirmed, the expense account shall be amended to reflect the municipality's expenses in connection with the motion, including filing fees, service fees, witness fees, attorneys' fees and traveling expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Orders of the health officer under this section shall be deemed prima facie lawful and reasonable.  The owner's lack of responsibility for creating the nuisance or danger to health shall not constitute a defense.  The court shall not deny the order except upon the following grounds, the burden of proof for which shall lie with the owner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the actions taken were clearly outside the authority of the health officer, or constituted a gross abuse of discretion;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That the owner did not receive any order pursuant to RSA 147:7-a, and that the nuisance or other danger to health was not one for which an owner may be held strictly liable under either state or federal law, and further, that neither the owner nor any agent of the owner knew, had any reason to know, or in the exercise of due care in the ownership and maintenance of property or any other legal duty could have had any reason to know, of the circumstances constituting the nuisance or other danger to health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the order is affirmed in whole or in part, the health officer shall forward it for collection in the manner provided by paragraph IV of this section.

For the purposes of this section, "officer'' shall mean any municipal official who orders such vacation, including the health officer acting under the authority of this section, RSA 147:4, or RSA 147:11, the building inspector acting under RSA 674:52-a, or the fire chief acting under RSA 154:21-a.  The following procedure shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The officer shall inform the owner and all occupants of the premises of the order, orally or otherwise, as soon, and by such means, as are practicable.  The order, if not effective immediately, shall include a reasonable time, in light of the seriousness and immediacy of the danger, within which vacation must occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A prominent notice shall be posted at each entrance to the building or other premises providing a brief description of the dangerous condition, and informing all persons that the premises has been ordered vacated, and of the officer making the order and the effective date and time of the order.  Such notice shall not be removed during the period such order is in effect, and anyone removing such notice shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  The following wording, though not exclusive, shall be deemed sufficient:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"DANGER.  THIS BUILDING (or other premises) IS UNSAFE BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING DANGEROUS CONDITION:  (brief description) __________ EFFECTIVE (date and time).  OCCUPANCY IS PROHIBITED BY ORDER OF THE (officer's title) OF THE TOWN (City) OF __________, UNDER AUTHORITY OF RSA 147:16-a.  DETAILS OF THIS VIOLATION ARE ON FILE AT __________.  ANYONE ENTERING THIS BUILDING (premises) WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE (officer's title), OR ANYONE REMOVING THIS NOTICE SHALL BE GUILTY OF A MISDEMEANOR.  PERSONS AGGRIEVED BY THIS ORDER MAY REQUEST A HEARING IN THE __________ DISTRICT COURT, AND MAY ASK THE COURT TO DIRECT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY TO REMOVE OR ABATE THE DANGEROUS CONDITION.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The officer shall cause written notice of the order to vacate to be sent, registered mail, to the owner of the property, if known, and to known lessees or others known to exercise control over the premises.  Such written notice shall be mailed within 24 hours of the order to vacate, or upon the next business day thereafter, provided, however that no such mailing shall be necessary in cases where, due to immediate removal or abatement of the source of danger, the order has been countermanded before that time.  In the alternative, the officer may cause the written notice to be served personally by a peace officer.  The written notice shall contain the address and description of the premises, a statement of the particulars of the danger to life, health, or safety, a statement of the date and time that the order becomes or became effective, and a statement of the right to a hearing in district court to contest the order or to have the court consider whether to direct the responsible party to remove or abate the source of danger.  The officer shall also forward a copy of the order to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction to enforce the order, and shall file a copy of the order, and a service list of the names and addresses of the people to whom the officer sent notice of the order, in the district court for the district in which the property is located.  Any court filing fee shall be paid by the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person specially aggrieved by the order to vacate may file a written request with the clerk of the district court for the district in which the property is located for a hearing to contest the order or to have the court consider whether to direct the responsible party to remove or abate the source of danger.  The hearing shall be held no later than 7 days after the request is received by the clerk who shall send a hearing notice to the aggrieved person, the municipality, and any other person whose name appears on the service list filed in court by the municipality.  The hearing shall concern whether the order to vacate is justified and/or whether the court shall order the responsible party to prospectively remove or abate the source of danger.  Other issues, including any challenge to outstanding ordinance or code violations, cease and desist orders, or removal or repair orders, shall be contested only under the statutes appertaining to them.  The court, upon presentation of such evidence as it may require, shall affirm, modify, or set aside the order to vacate, issue any such other appropriate order as is consistent with this paragraph, and enter judgment accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any person who fails to comply with an order under this section, after having received due notice of it, either orally, in writing, or by posted notice, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor unless the district court has set aside the order.  A deficiency in the municipal officer's adherence to this section shall not constitute a defense to the misdemeanor charge unless it amounts to failure of notice to the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A municipality may combine any order to vacate under this section with other lawful orders, including but not limited to orders under RSA 147:7-a, RSA 154:20, RSA 155-B:2, or RSA 676:17-a, as long as the minimum procedures of this section are met.  When and if the source of danger is removed or abated following the issuance of any order to vacate under this section or any order under paragraph IV or if the order to vacate is set aside by the district court, the displaced occupants shall have the right to return to occupancy in the building, structure, or other premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a residence which is occupied only by the owner and his or her immediate family, unless the condition of such premises constitutes a clear and imminent danger to the life or health of persons other than the occupant or occupants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect a municipality's duty to provide general assistance under RSA 165.  No proceeding under this section shall be deemed to affect any legal rights between landlord and tenant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the district court finds that a municipality's order to vacate under this section was frivolous, or was commenced in bad faith, or was not based upon reasonable information and belief, then the court may order the municipality to pay the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees of any aggrieved person requesting a hearing on the order to vacate under paragraph IV.
