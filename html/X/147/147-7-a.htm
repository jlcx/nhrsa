<codesect>
As a prerequisite to the use of the alternative abatement cost collection procedure under RSA 147:7-b, any notice or order given pursuant to RSA 147:4, 147:11, 147:17, or 147:17-a, shall be in writing and subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The notice shall contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A description of the nuisance or other danger to the public health, including the date of any inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement of what corrective action is required, and a reasonable time, in light of the seriousness of the nuisance or other danger to health, within which that action must be taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement that failure to take the corrective action within that time may result in corrective action being taken by the municipality, and that if this occurs, the municipality's costs shall constitute a lien against the real estate, enforceable in the same manner as real estate taxes, including possible loss of the property, if not paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The notice shall be sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the last known post-office address of the current owner, if known, or of the person against whom taxes are assessed for the property, and to any tenant, occupant, owner's agent, or other person known by the health officer to exercise control over the premises.
