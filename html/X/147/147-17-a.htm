I. Faulty Private Sewage System.  Whenever any private sewage system is in such disrepair as to constitute a source of danger to the health of the public, the health officer may order the owner to put the same in a proper sanitary condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Failure to Repair.  If the person so ordered fails to rectify the problem, the municipal health officer may request the selectmen or mayor and council, if sufficient funds have been appropriated for this purpose, to put the system in a proper sanitary condition.
