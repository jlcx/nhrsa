<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any emergency response/public safety worker who, while in the line of duty, sustains an unprotected exposure to himself or herself or another individual protected under RSA 508:12, or who suspects such an exposure, shall, as soon as possible, provide a copy of the emergency response/public safety worker incident report form to the worker's medical referral consultant.  If the source individual is transported to a health care facility licensed under RSA 151, the exposed worker shall also provide a copy of the incident report form to the infection control officer of the facility as soon as possible after arrival of the source individual at the facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall prepare and distribute the emergency response/public safety worker incident report form.  The form shall include, at a minimum, the names of persons who believe they have sustained an unprotected exposure, the manner in which the exposure occurred, the name of the employer's medical referral consultant and such other relevant information that the department may require by rule adopted under RSA 141-G:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section shall be construed as negating whatever responsibility the fire department, police department, correctional facility, or emergency medical services unit might have for the protection and care of its employees, or the responsibility of any emergency care worker to safeguard such emergency care worker's health by using all appropriate protective equipment provided by the employer, by following appropriate procedures, and by seeking medical advice and attention when prudent.
