<codesect>
The department shall have a direct and tangible interest in vital records data including personal identifiers.  The secretary of state shall provide continuous electronic access to the department of the entire contents of the data files on a 24-hour, 7-day per week basis.

Such access shall be provided in standard database format that establishes a remote electronic link from the secretary of state's office to the department that would not restrict the ability of the department to transfer data.  However, under no circumstance shall any information relative to any adoption or any restricted record as determined by a court of law be provided to the department.

I. There is hereby established an independent board administratively attached, pursuant to RSA 21-G:10, to the department to review requests for vital records information for the purposes of conducting health-related research.

The commissioner shall appoint 3 of the members and the secretary of state shall appoint 3 members.  The board shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members, and the diversity of the members to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of vital records information that is used for the purposes of health-related research.  In addition to possessing the professional competence necessary to review specific health-related research activities, the board shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of applicable law, regulations, and standards of professional conduct and practice.  The board shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas.
<br>

V. No member of the board shall participate in initial or continuing review of any health-related research project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues which require expertise beyond or in addition to that possessed by the members of the board.  These individuals may only offer advice and guidance and shall not participate in the decision as to whether or not to approve the release of vital records information for the purposes of health-related research.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The board shall have 2 part-time staff persons to conduct the duties associated with the work of the board.  The board shall reimburse members for travel expenses associated with board activities.
