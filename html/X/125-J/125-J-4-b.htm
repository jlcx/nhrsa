The department may also establish and administer a process for the allocation of NOx budget allowances, emissions reduction credits, discrete emission reductions, and other emissions reduction mechanisms which it is assigned by the federal government or interstate agreements or which it acquires in any other manner, except for shutdown of devices and sources.
