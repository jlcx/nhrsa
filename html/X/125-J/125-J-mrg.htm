<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall establish and administer a process for the application, certification, revocation and enforcement of emissions reduction credits for the following regulated pollutants:  volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person may be credited with emissions reductions occurring after December 31, 1990.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department shall issue emissions reduction credits to any person upon certification by the department that the emissions reductions are real, surplus, quantifiable, enforceable, and permanent, and that a device or source is not in violation of any emissions limitation of a permit issued by the department or EPA, any consent agreement, or court order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall issue an emissions reduction credit certificate to any person having certified emissions reduction credits.  The certificate shall be in the name of the permit holder for a device or source, and in the name of the person certifying the emissions reduction for the device, area source, mobile source, and sources exempt from permitting requirements under RSA 125-C.  The total amount of ERCs certified to a device, area source, mobile source, and source, together with any conditions required to ensure that such ERCs remain real, surplus, permanent, enforceable and quantifiable for the life of the ERC, shall be recorded on the certificate and, for every permitted device and source, as an amendment to any permit issued for the device or source by the department or by the EPA.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All emissions reductions obtained from devices, area sources, mobile sources, and sources shall be eligible for certification, regardless of whether the reductions were generated from emissions previously regulated under permits issued by the department or EPA, provided that the department determines that the reductions are real, surplus, quantifiable, enforceable and permanent, and that such reductions are certified in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Emissions reductions shall be certified for use on a calendar year basis.  The minimum amount of emissions reductions eligible under this chapter for certification shall be 1 ton per calendar year, per pollutant.  ERCs shall be certified in a ratio of 1 ton per calendar year of credit for 1 ton per calendar year of reduction for each pollutant.  Emissions reductions of less than 1 ton may be aggregated in order to achieve the minimum 1 ton requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner may suspend, modify, or revoke any emissions reduction credits certificate issued under this chapter, or any portion thereof, upon a finding, following a hearing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the certificate holder has committed a violation of this chapter, or any rule, order, permit, or certificate condition in force and applicable to it;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That the certificate contains a material mistake or that the certificate, or its terms or conditions, were established and issued on the basis of inaccurate information;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That the certificate issued must be revised to assure that the reductions represented thereon are and remain quantifiable, real, permanent, enforceable and surplus, and in compliance with all terms and conditions issued thereto.

IV. ERCs to be used in satisfying any offset requirement under the Clean Air Act or RSA 125-C, and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder, respectively, shall be transferred on a permanent basis.  ERCs to be used in satisfying any RACT requirement under the Clean Air Act or RSA 125-C and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder, respectively, may be transferred on a temporary or permanent basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. ERCs held for future use in any calendar year shall not be aggregated for any purpose with ERCs certified for use in any other calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. ERCs to be used for the purpose of satisfying any RACT requirement shall have been obtained by the same source or device or another source or device in the same nonattainment area.  ERCs to be used for the purpose of satisfying any offset requirement shall have been obtained in accordance with the Clear Air Act and RSA 125-C and the rules promulgated thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Emissions reduction credits which have been certified to, or emissions reductions which are eligible for certification to, a device or source which shuts down its production operations shall be shutdown emissions credits and shall revert to the state for use consistent with this chapter, except where such ERCs are to be used at other devices and sources within the state by the person or persons who owned, operated or controlled the device or source that was shutdown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Shutdown emissions credits obtained by the state pursuant to this chapter shall be used or held for use by the governor and council for meeting any requirement of the state implementation plan, any attainment demonstration under the Clean Air Act, or for the transfer to new or existing devices and sources in the state which require offsets under the Clean Air Act.  No less than 75 percent of shutdown emissions credits generated in serious nonattainment areas shall be applied to requirements applicable in serious nonattainment areas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Transfers of shutdown emissions credits to new or existing sources and devices to meet offset requirements shall be temporary in nature and at no cost, except as otherwise provided in this section.  An owner of a source or device who desires to receive a transfer of credits shall file an application with the department setting forth the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whether and to what extent the acquisition of the credits will result in job retention;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) How use of the credits will result in economic development in New Hampshire;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the applicant's company offers prospects for long-term growth and job creation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Whether the applicant's company is a New Hampshire business or is relocating to New Hampshire;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The market value of the credits and the information used to make such determination;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The date that the applicant submitted or will submit to the department an application for an air permit under RSA 125-C:11, which shall be a prerequisite for the transfer of credits;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The air quality classification of the area where the source or device will be located;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The date that the source or device is estimated to commence operation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The number of offsets required to comply with requirements of the Clean Air Act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The department shall review the application and provide the governor and council with a written recommendation that addresses the information submitted by the applicant.  Priority shall be given to applications that result in job retention and that assist existing New Hampshire businesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. An applicant that receives a transfer of shutdown emissions credits from the governor and council shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Return the credits to the state, upon notice of the department, if the applicant's permit application under RSA 125-C:13 is denied or the source or device is not constructed or fails to commence operation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 18 months of commencing operation of the source or device:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Return the shutdown emissions credits to the state and acquire the necessary ERCs from elsewhere to continue operation, as approved by the department;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If some or all of the necessary ERCs to continue operation are not readily available to the applicant, as determined by the department, retain such quantity of shutdown emissions credits and purchase them from the state at a value, as can best be determined by the department, that will enable the state to later acquire a number of ERCs equal to the number of shutdown emissions credits retained and purchased by the applicant.  If the department does not anticipate that ERCs will be readily available in the foreseeable future for the state to purchase, the governor and council shall determine the purchase value of the retained shutdown emissions credits after receipt of a written recommendation from the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Funds from the sale of shutdown emissions credits shall be deposited in a special account within the air resources permit fund to be used by the governor and council for the acquisition and generation of ERCs that shall be used for the same purposes and administered in the same manner as shutdown emission credits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The use of emissions reduction credits by a utility, as defined in RSA 362:2, shall be subject to such additional conditions as ordered pursuant to applicable law by the public utilities commission.
