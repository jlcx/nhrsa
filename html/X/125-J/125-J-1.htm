&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-J:1 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Actual emissions'' means the rate, in tons per year, at which the device or source actually emitted a pollutant during calendar year 1990, or the average rate, in tons per year, at which the device or source actually emitted a pollutant during any 2-year period which precedes the date of application by no more than 5 years and which is representative of normal production rates, and which the department determines does not jeopardize any attainment demonstration under the Clean Air Act.  Actual emissions shall be calculated using factors such as the source's actual operating hours, production rates, stack emissions rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the applicable period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Allowable emissions'' means the emission rate of a device or source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the device or source, or, if applicable, federally enforceable limits which restrict the emission rate, operating rate, hours of operation, or any combination thereof, and the most stringent of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any applicable standard set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 60 or 40 C.F.R. part 61;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any applicable New Hampshire state implementation plan emissions limitation, including a limitation with a future compliance date;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any emissions rate specified as a condition of a federally enforceable permit issued by the department or EPA, including those with a future compliance date, or a federally enforceable emissions reductions credit certificate issued pursuant to an EPA-approved economic incentive program ("EIP'').
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

"Emission budget'' or "budget'' means the numerical result in tons per season of NOx emissions which results from the application of the emission reduction requirement of the ozone transport commission memorandum of understanding dated September 27, 1994, and which is the maximum amount of NOx emissions which may be released from the budget sources collectively during a given control period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

One ERC shall represent 2,000 pounds (1 ton) of emissions reduction per calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. "Enforceable'' means those limitations and conditions on the operating rate, hours of operation, or types of materials processed, stored, or combusted of a source or device which are incorporated into a federally enforceable permit issued by the department or EPA, a federally enforceable emissions reduction credit certificate issued by the department pursuant to this chapter, or a revision to the SIP.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. "Mobile source'' means on-road vehicles such as automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles and non-road vehicles such as trains, airplanes, agricultural equipment, construction vehicles, off-road recreational vehicles and motorcycles, and boating vessels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIX. "Netting'' means the process of determining whether a net emissions increase of a state or federally regulated pollutant at an existing major source will result from a proposed physical change or change in the method of operation.  Netting is used to determine whether prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) or nonattainment area new source review applies to modifications at existing sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIX-a. "NOx budget allowance'' means the limited authorization to emit one ton of NOx during a specified control period.  All NOx budget allowances shall be allocated, transferred, or used as whole NOx budget allowances.  To determine the number of whole allowances, the number of NOx budget allowances shall be rounded down for decimals less than 0.50 and rounded up for decimals of 0.50 or greater.
<br>

"NOx budget source'' means a fossil fuel fired boiler or indirect heat exchanger with a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 MMBtu/Hour, or more;  and all electric generating facilities with a rated output of 15 MW, or more.  Any person who applies to opt into the NOx budget program shall be considered a NOx budget source upon acceptance of the application for opt-in.
