<codesect>
The legislative facilities committee shall equip and maintain a health service room in such location in the state house as may be assigned for such purpose.  Said room shall be staffed by a licensed registered nurse employed by the legislative facilities committee, and the room shall be kept open at all times when the state house is open for business.  The expense of the health service room, including a contract nurse, shall be a charge upon the joint expenses appropriation to the general court.  The department of health and human services may, in the event of the absence of the employed nurse, provide from its staff a licensed registered nurse on a temporary basis.  The department of health and human services is further authorized, in the event the department cannot provide a licensed registered nurse, to negotiate a contract for the legislative facilities committee with a nursing service for the purpose of staffing the health service room in the event of an absence of the employed nurse.  The daily coordination of the contract nurse shall be accomplished jointly with the house chief of staff and the department of health and human services.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall provide medical supervision for the employed nurse, for any temporarily assigned nurse and, if necessary, for any contracted nursing service.
