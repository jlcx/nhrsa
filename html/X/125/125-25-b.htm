I. Any health care practitioner who has an ownership interest in an entity which provides diagnostic or therapeutic services, or receives compensation or remuneration for referral of such patient to an entity which provides diagnostic or therapeutic services, shall disclose such interest to any patient prior to referring the patient to such entity for diagnostic or therapeutic services.
<br>

This office will provide an alternative referral upon your request.''
