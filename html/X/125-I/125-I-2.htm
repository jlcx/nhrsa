<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Air contaminant'' means soot, cinders, ashes, any dust, fume, gas, mist (other than water), odor, toxic or radioactive material, particulate matter, or any combination thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Air toxic'' means air contaminants designated by the commissioner of the department of environmental services from the organic compounds and metals listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 261, Subparts C and D and Table 4 of 450/5-86-011a and subsequent updates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Ambient air'' means the unconfined atmosphere that envelops the earth.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Ambient air limit'' means the standard designated pursuant to RSA 125-I:4 that establishes the maximum allowable concentration of emissions of a specific regulated toxic air pollutant at or beyond the compliance boundary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Commissioner'' means the commissioner of the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Compliance boundary'' means the boundary of the property on which the stationary source is located or an alternate compliance boundary determined by the department in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Council'' means the air resources council established pursuant to RSA 21-O:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Department'' means the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. "Device'' means any burner, furnace, machine, equipment, or article which emits a regulated toxic air pollutant or air contaminant into the ambient air.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. "Modification'' means any physical or operational change in a stationary source or device which increases the amount of a specific regulated toxic air pollutant emitted by such source or device, or which results in the emission of any additional regulated toxic air pollutant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. "Pollution control equipment'' means any device that treats, removes, restricts, or otherwise controls the release or discharge of regulated toxic air pollutants that is not vital to normal productions operations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Process'' means any operation which combines devices, equipment, raw materials, utilities, and manpower for the production of goods, services, energy, pollution control, or other purposes which emits a regulated toxic air pollutant into the ambient air.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. "Reference concentration limit'' means an estimate established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency of a daily exposure to the human population, including sensitive subgroups, that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious noncancer effects during a lifetime.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. "Regulated toxic air pollutant'' means any substance or compound emitted into the ambient air by a stationary source and designated a regulated toxic air pollutant pursuant to RSA 125-I:4.  Regulated toxic air pollutants are classified as:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Class I, meaning any regulated toxic air pollutant recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a Group A-Human Carcinogen or Group B-Probable Human Carcinogen, as referenced in 51 Federal Register 34,000 (1986), or otherwise designated a regulated toxic air pollutant--Class I by the commissioner pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 125-I:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class II, meaning any regulated toxic air pollutant other than a regulated toxic air pollutant Class I, which is recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a Group C-Possible Human Carcinogen, as referenced in 51 Federal Register 34,000 (1986), or otherwise designated a regulated toxic air pollutant--Class II by the commissioner pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 125-I:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class III, meaning any regulated toxic air pollutant other than a regulated toxic air pollutant--Class I or Class II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. "Stationary source'' means any building, structure, facility, or installation that emits or may emit a regulated toxic air pollutant or air contaminant into the ambient air.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. "Threshold limit value'' means the threshold limit value-time weighted average (TLV-TWA) as set forth in the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) 1995 list and as amended thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. "Uncontrolled emission'' means any emission of a regulated toxic air pollutant from a device or process at a stationary source that is not subject to treatment or removal by pollution control equipment prior to being emitted to the ambient air, or is emitted to the ambient air in amounts which have not been limited by conditions in an enforceable permit or document.
