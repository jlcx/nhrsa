In establishing ambient air limits under this chapter, the department shall rely on threshold limit values, reference concentration limits, and such other generally accepted scientific data as may be available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall publish the list of all regulated toxic air pollutants, their classification as a regulated toxic air pollutant--Class I,--Class II or--Class III, and their respective short-term and long-term ambient air limits immediately upon adoption of the rules establishing such classifications and ambient air limits for each regulated toxic air pollutant.  Publication of notice of such list shall be made by the department in the New Hampshire Rulemaking Register.  Thereafter, the department shall publish annually a complete list of all regulated toxic air pollutants, classifications, and ambient air limits.  Any revision to the list of regulated toxic air pollutants or their respective classifications or ambient air limits made prior to the annual publication of such list shall be noticed by publication of notice of the revision by the commissioner in the New Hampshire Rulemaking Register and shall not take effect until such publication of notice has occurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. At any time, or pursuant to petition of any stationary source or affected person, the commissioner may modify the list of regulated toxic air pollutants by adding or deleting any substance or compound from the list, or by establishing or modifying any classification or ambient air limit for such substances or compounds, by adopting rules in accordance with the provisions of RSA 541-A, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A substance or compound may be added to the list only if there is at least one study that has been conducted in accordance with generally accepted scientific principles that demonstrates that the substance or compound is known to cause or may reasonably be anticipated to cause acute, chronic, mutagenic, reproductive, or developmental health effects in humans as a result of exposure to such substances or compounds.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Existing devices or processes emitting regulated toxic air pollutants at a stationary source in operation as of the effective date of the rules adopted by the commissioner under RSA 125-I:6, II shall comply with either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The rules adopted by the commissioner relative to air toxics, including but not limited to rules establishing ambient air limits, in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this section for a period of 3 years following the effective date of this section at which time such stationary sources shall comply with the rules adopted under this chapter relative to regulated toxic air pollutants;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Rules adopted under this chapter relative to regulated toxic air pollutants at any time, but no later than 3 years following the effective date of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All new and modified devices or processes emitting regulated toxic air pollutants at a stationary source shall comply with the rules adopted under this chapter relative to regulated toxic air pollutants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the department revises the list of regulated toxic air pollutants or their respective ambient air limits or classifications under RSA 125-I:4, II and III, and as a result of such revision any source of regulated toxic air pollutants is required to obtain or modify a permit under the provisions of RSA 125-I or RSA 125-C, the stationary source shall have 90 days following publication of notice of such final revision in the New Hampshire Rulemaking Register to file a complete application for such permit or permit modification.  The department shall include as conditions in any permit issued as a result of a revision to the list of regulated toxic air pollutants a compliance plan and a schedule for achieving compliance based on public health, economic and technical considerations, not to exceed 3 years.  Failure to comply with any such compliance plan or schedule of compliance shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of RSA 125-I:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A person or persons having ownership or control of a stationary source may demonstrate compliance with this chapter and any rules adopted under this chapter by air dispersion analysis or such other techniques as the department designates pursuant to rules adopted by the commissioner in accordance with RSA 541-A.  In addition, the department shall establish in rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A one or more methodologies by which any stationary source can determine, through testing, calculation, or other methods without air dispersion modeling, whether the existing or proposed emission of any regulated toxic air pollutant will result in an exceedance of an ambient air limit at the source's compliance boundary.
