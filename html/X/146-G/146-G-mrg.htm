&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146-G:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that ethers contained in gasoline, due to their extreme fluidity, recalcitrance to natural degradation, low taste and odor thresholds, and probable carcinogenic qualities, comprise a sufficiently distinct class of property which represent a particular, present, and rapidly escalating threat to the quality of all the water of the state and, thereby, to our citizens.  The general court also finds that potentially serious health, safety, and environmental problems are evidenced due to the speed with which ethers are able to flow into, contaminate, and accumulate in invaluable groundwater supplies.  In addition, the cost of cleanup of gasoline ethers in groundwater and surface water is a significant economic burden for which economic assistance may otherwise not be available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of this chapter is to provide procedures that will expedite the cleanup of gasoline ether spillage, mitigate the adverse affects of gasoline ether discharges, encourage preventive measures, impose a fee upon importers of neat gasoline ethers into the state and establish a fund for the remediation of groundwater and surface water contaminated by gasoline ethers.  The fund may also be used to provide financial reimbursement to owners of public and private water supplies for the treatment and removal of gasoline ethers and associated contaminants when present with those ethers from those supplies.  The fund established under this chapter shall be in addition to the oil pollution control fund established pursuant to RSA 146-A:11-a and is separate from the oil discharge and disposal cleanup fund established pursuant to RSA 146-D:3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146-G:4 Fund Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund which shall be administered by the board.  This nonlapsing, revolving fund shall be used to pay the costs to implement the provisions of this chapter which include, but are not limited to, the salaries and expenses of personnel, as approved by the fiscal committee, to the extent that such salaries and expenses are incurred in implementing the provisions of this chapter, testing and monitoring activities, and other costs of treatment or removal or corrective measures deemed necessary by the board as a result of an actual or potential discharge of gasoline ethers into or onto the surface water or groundwater of the state.  Moneys from the fund shall be used to mitigate the adverse affects of gasoline ether discharges including, but not limited to, provision of emergency water supplies to persons affected by such pollution, and, where necessary as determined by the board, the establishment of an acceptable source of potable water to injured parties.  Not more than $150,000 shall be allocated annually for research programs dedicated to the development and improvement of preventive and cleanup measures concerning such gasoline ether discharges.  Income derived from the fund shall only be used for those administrative costs needed to implement this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Moneys in the fund not currently needed to meet the obligations of the board under this chapter shall be deposited with the state treasurer to the credit of the fund and shall be invested as provided by law.  Interest received on such investment shall also be credited to the fund.  If the fund's balance becomes greater than $2,500,000, the transfer of moneys into the fund as established in RSA 146-D:3, VI(b) shall be discontinued and only re-established when the fund's balance is below $1,000,000.  Those fees normally transferred to the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund shall accumulate instead in the oil discharge and disposal cleanup fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All moneys paid to the state to reimburse costs paid out of the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund by any person strictly liable to the state under RSA 146-A:3-a shall be placed in the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Corrective measures authorized by this chapter shall include but not be limited to:

I. Provision of interim water supplies to residents whose water supplies have been contaminated due to the presence of gasoline ethers above standards set by the board or a condition related to gasoline ethers determined to be hazardous by the office of community and public health and the state forensic toxicologist.  This may include the supply of bottled water and the installation and operation of water supply treatment systems, approved or provided by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The establishment of an acceptable source of potable water to injured parties, where necessary, as determined by the board.  This may include but not be limited to a proportioned share of the costs of construction of the extension of public water mains and appurtenances, the installation of replacement water supply wells and appurtenances, or the installation of water treatment processes for new or existing water supplies.  The extent of reimbursement shall be determined based upon criteria established by rules adopted by the board.  Such rules shall consider the overall need for the capital investment to address contamination or threatened contamination of water supplies by gasoline ethers.  Operation and maintenance costs or annual user fees for new or upgraded public water supply main extensions or treatment processes shall not be eligible expenses under this paragraph.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146-G:7 License Required;  Fee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any distributor who imports or causes to be imported neat gasoline ethers into the state shall be licensed by the department of safety under this chapter.  The annual fee for the license shall be $0.10 per gallon of neat gasoline ethers imported into this state for the purpose of being mixed or blended with gasoline prior to sale to the public.  The fee shall be paid monthly by such person to the department of safety and deposited by the department of safety into the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund.  Imposition of the fee shall be based on the records of the person and certified as accurate to the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every distributor who imports or causes to be imported neat gasoline ethers into the state shall file a monthly report for the preceding month and shall include all fees due for that reporting period with the department of safety on or before the twentieth day of the following calendar month.  Failure to file by the required date or to enclose fees due shall result in the assessment of a 10 percent penalty to be added to the amount of fees due for that month.  If no fees are due, a penalty of $10 per day shall be assessed.  Such penalty shall immediately accrue and thereafter the overdue fees and the penalty shall bear interest at the rate established by the Internal Revenue Service effective on the first business day of the calendar year.  To this rate shall be added 2 percent.  In determining the monthly rate, that figure shall be rounded off to the nearest quarter percent.  The board may waive all or any portion of penalties or interest for good cause.  Such cause and incident shall be recorded in the records of the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No distributor licensed under this section shall import neat gasoline ethers into this state without paying the fee required by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless otherwise provided, any distributor who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if a natural person or guilty of a felony if any other person.
