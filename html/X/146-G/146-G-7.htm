I. Any distributor who imports or causes to be imported neat gasoline ethers into the state shall be licensed by the department of safety under this chapter.  The annual fee for the license shall be $0.10 per gallon of neat gasoline ethers imported into this state for the purpose of being mixed or blended with gasoline prior to sale to the public.  The fee shall be paid monthly by such person to the department of safety and deposited by the department of safety into the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund.  Imposition of the fee shall be based on the records of the person and certified as accurate to the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every distributor who imports or causes to be imported neat gasoline ethers into the state shall file a monthly report for the preceding month and shall include all fees due for that reporting period with the department of safety on or before the twentieth day of the following calendar month.  Failure to file by the required date or to enclose fees due shall result in the assessment of a 10 percent penalty to be added to the amount of fees due for that month.  If no fees are due, a penalty of $10 per day shall be assessed.  Such penalty shall immediately accrue and thereafter the overdue fees and the penalty shall bear interest at the rate established by the Internal Revenue Service effective on the first business day of the calendar year.  To this rate shall be added 2 percent.  In determining the monthly rate, that figure shall be rounded off to the nearest quarter percent.  The board may waive all or any portion of penalties or interest for good cause.  Such cause and incident shall be recorded in the records of the gasoline remediation and elimination of ethers fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No distributor licensed under this section shall import neat gasoline ethers into this state without paying the fee required by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless otherwise provided, any distributor who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if a natural person or guilty of a felony if any other person.
