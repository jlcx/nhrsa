It is the policy of the state to safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare;  to protect the public from being misled by incompetent, unscrupulous, and unprofessional conduct by hearing care providers;  and to assure the availability of the highest possible quality hearing care services to the people of this state.  It is therefore necessary to regulate hearing aid dealers and audiologists who provide hearing care services to the public.
