<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Mosquitoes can harbor organisms and infect people with diseases that pose a serious risk to the public health.  When an increased threat of disease is discovered through surveillance, a state agency may select targeted control of mosquitoes as a measure to reduce human health risk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The mosquito control policy is based on the public health principle of primary prevention, meaning that disease prevention through public awareness, continuing education, and personal responsibility shall take precedence over the use of pesticide-based mosquito control measures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Because authority for monitoring and treatment of mosquito populations exists at the local level, maximum benefit to the public is achieved when local, state, and federal mosquito control policies are applied in a clear, consistent, and coordinated manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The control of mosquitoes on state lands requires a careful balance between the state's obligation to protect the health and wellbeing of the public and the state's interest in protecting those lands as expressed by the missions of the various state agencies that have been assigned responsibilities for land management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Mosquito control should always be based on the best available science.  Recognizing that there are uncertainties in scientific information, mosquito control shall be based on best medical and public health practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The mosquito control policy for state agencies established in this chapter is also intended to serve as a voluntary guideline for mosquito control on lands held by other property owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. State agencies managing land shall allow mosquito control and abatement activities to occur in accordance with local mosquito control plans developed pursuant to RSA 141-C when the department has notified the appropriate agency managing state land that a public health threat declaration under RSA 141-C:25 is in effect, or has previously been in effect within the last 3 years, for the affected municipality or mosquito control district in accordance with RSA 142-A:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Notwithstanding RSA 142-A:3, VI, nothing in this chapter shall prohibit state agencies managing land from considering, in accordance with applicable law and rules, pesticides or other control measures not specifically identified in RSA 142-A:3.
