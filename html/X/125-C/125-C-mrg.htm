<center><h3>Section 125-C:6-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-C:6-a Enhanced Environmental Performance Agreements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the purpose of this section to create a voluntary pilot program by which the commissioner of environmental services may enter into enhanced environmental performance agreements (EEPAs) with persons regulated under this chapter to implement innovative environmental measures not otherwise recognized or allowed under existing laws and rules of this state, if those measures achieve emissions reductions or reductions in discharges or wastes which equal or exceed those required under applicable statutes and rules, and to test innovative strategies for achieving enhanced environmental results.  Approaches embodied in EEPAs should typically represent, favor, or promote pollution prevention, source reduction, environmental innovation, and transferability to other applicable entities, without increasing the overall level of pollution emitted directly or indirectly to the air, water, and land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After notice and opportunity for public comment and hearing, the commissioner may enter into enhanced environmental performance agreements with any person regulated under any or all of RSA 125-C, RSA 125-D, RSA 125-I, or RSA 125-J to implement innovative environmental measures that relate to provisions of these chapters, even if one or more of the terms of such an agreement would be inconsistent with an otherwise applicable statute or rule of this state.  Participation in this program is limited to those persons who have submitted an enhanced environmental performance agreement that is acceptable to the commissioner.  A decision by the commissioner to not enter into an agreement with any person is not appealable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An enhanced environmental performance agreement shall operate in lieu of existing permits identified in the agreement.  Any environmental statute, regulation, or condition in an existing permit that differs from a term or condition in an agreement shall cease to apply from the effective date of an initial or renewed agreement until the agreement is terminated or expires.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Persons applying to the commissioner for enhanced environmental performance agreements shall, at a minimum:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Submit a description of how the proposal is consistent with the purpose of this section and federal guidelines, and a comprehensive description of the proposed EEPA which includes the nature of the facility, the operations which will be affected, how such operations will be altered to achieve superior emissions reductions, and the extent of emissions reduction anticipated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Include in EEPA proposals the following, without limitation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Identification of all state and federal statutes, rules and regulations applicable to the source.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Identification of all statutes, rules and regulations that are inconsistent with one or more terms of the proposed agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A statement describing how the proposed agreement will achieve the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A statement describing the implementation of the proposed agreement, including a list of steps and schedule.  Implementation of the proposed agreement shall not increase overall worker safety risks or create undue risk burdens on others.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Identification of those members of the general public, representatives of local communities, environmental groups, and other appropriate parties who have participated in the development of the proposed agreement or who have an interest in the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Identification of how the applicant will demonstrate ongoing satisfaction of the requirements of the agreement, including but not limited to, mechanisms for performance assurance and the type of performance guarantees to be provided, which guarantees shall be directly related to the complexity of, and risk associated with, the proposal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) A description of and plan for public participation in the EEPA.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A schedule for review by the commissioner of the performance of the proposed EEPA.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) Provisions for voluntary and involuntary termination of the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Without limiting the commissioner's authority under this section to specify additional criteria, the commissioner may adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, specifying criteria for acceptance of proposed enhanced environmental performance agreements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In the event of deficient performance of any term or condition in the agreement, the commissioner may, with written notice, terminate any agreement, and the participant shall then be subject to enforcement under the applicable chapter.  The commissioner's decision to terminate an agreement is not appealable.  If an agreement is terminated, the participant shall have 30 days to apply for any necessary permits concerning operations that were in effect during the course of the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority or the ability of the attorney general to initiate enforcement action against a person for violation of any laws of this state or rules adopted under such laws, except that an enhanced environmental performance agreement shall be deemed to be a permit to engage in activities authorized under the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Nothing in this section shall reduce, eliminate, or in any way affect any fees that a participant in this program may be required to pay under any federal or state law.  Applicants for participation in the enhanced environmental performance agreements program shall pay all costs associated with public notice and hearings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-C:10-b Best Available Control Technology Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purposes of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Best available control technology'' means an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction for each air contaminant that would be emitted from any device that the department, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, public health, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such device through application of production processes or available equipment, methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such air contaminant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Exempt fuel'' means coal, natural gas, landfill gas, digester or bio gas, untreated wood, virgin petroleum products, or any mixture thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in paragraph VII, the construction, installation, operation, or modification of any device located at an affected source that will combust any material shall be prohibited without first applying for and obtaining a permit from the department that establishes emission limitations for such device based on best available control technology for controlling any particulate matter, mercury, or dioxin emissions from such device.  Any material to be combusted in such device that is not an exempt fuel shall be certified as complying with standards established by the department.  As part of the application for a permit, the affected source shall demonstrate that such standards and certification shall be complied with during facility operation.  The permit shall contain inspection, testing, and reporting requirements to ensure such standards are met.  The permit shall establish procedures for sampling and testing appropriate to the material to be combusted using US EPA SW-846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, and applicable American Society for Testing and Materials sampling methods or alternate sampling and testing methods approved by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If stack testing results show that emissions from a device are less than but within 10 percent of the emission limitation for a specific air contaminant established under paragraph II for the device, the affected source shall install a department approved continuous emission monitor (CEM) for that air contaminant.  If a department approved CEM is not available for that air contaminant, the affected source shall submit a plan, including monitoring and stack testing requirements, for ensuring that the emissions limitation for that air contaminant is not exceeded until such time as a department approved CEM for that air contaminant becomes available.  Once a department approved CEM is available, the affected source shall install that CEM within 24 months of department approval of the CEM.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Once the department has established an emission limitation for one or more air contaminants under paragraph II for a device based on best available control technology, no further best available control technology determination for the emission of such air contaminant or air contaminants from such device shall be required for such period of time as specified in rules of the department, unless there is a modification of the device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any determination by the department pursuant to paragraph II, shall be subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In no event shall application of best available control technology result in:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Emission of any air contaminant that would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under RSA 125-C or RSA 125-I or rules adopted pursuant to either chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Emission of any air contaminant specified in paragraph II in an amount disproportionate to the emissions of such air contaminant from other similar air pollution control devices for that air contaminant at facilities using similar combustion technology and similar fuels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the department determines that a device emits more than one of the air contaminants specified in paragraph II, or that the affected source has more than one device that emits such air contaminants, the department shall determine best available control technology emission limitations for all such devices and all such air contaminants emitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If, prior to the effective date of this section, the department made under other authority a best available control technology determination for any air contaminant specified in paragraph II for any existing device and established in a permit issued pursuant to this chapter an emission limitation for such air contaminant, then no determination of best available control technology pursuant to paragraph II for such air contaminant from such device shall be required for such period of time as specified in rules of the department, unless there is a modification of the device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. This section shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A municipal waste combustor that is subject to RSA 125-M;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Chemical recovery combustion sources at pulp and paper mills subject to 40 CFR 63, Subpart MM;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A device at an affected source that combusts material of which at least 90 percent by weight is exempt fuel;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An affected source that is within a listed source category and subject to a performance standard or emission guidelines established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to either section 111 or section 112 or section 129 of the Clean Air Act, provided that these standards and guidelines are at least as stringent as those achieved by applying best available control technology as specified under paragraph II;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A device at an affected source that, on the effective date of this section, routinely combusts any material other than a material specified in subparagraph (c) under a permit issued by the department, unless there is later a modification of such device;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A device at an affected source with emissions of particulate matter, mercury, or dioxin below threshold levels established by rules of the department.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-C:16 Variances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon application, and after a hearing, the commissioner may suspend the enforcement of the whole or any part of this chapter or of any rule adopted hereunder in the case of any person who shall show that the enforcement thereof would produce serious economic hardship on such person without equal or greater benefits to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining under what conditions and to what extent the variance may be granted, the commissioner shall give due recognition to the progress which the person requesting such variance shall have made in eliminating or preventing air pollution;  the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, the health and physical property of the people;  and the social and economic value of the source of air pollution.  In such cases, the commissioner shall consider the reasonableness of granting a variance conditioned on the person's effecting a partial abatement of pollution or a progressive abatement thereof or such other circumstances as the commissioner may deem reasonable.  No variance shall be granted to any person applying therefor who is causing air pollution which creates a danger to public health, welfare or safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any variance granted hereunder shall be granted for such period of time, not exceeding one year, as the commissioner shall specify.  No variance shall be construed to relieve the person receiving it from any liability imposed by law for the commission or maintenance of a nuisance.
