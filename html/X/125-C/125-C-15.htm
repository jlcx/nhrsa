I. Whenever the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative finds that any device, non-Title V source, affected source of air pollution, or any other source of air pollution has resulted in a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or any rules in force hereunder, or any condition in a permit issued under this chapter, the commissioner shall issue a notice of violation and, where appropriate, an order of abatement establishing a compliance schedule with which the device, non-Title V source, affected source, or any other source shall comply.  Any order of abatement shall become final and enforceable by the commissioner within 30 days of its issuance unless an appeal is filed with the air resources council before the expiration of said 30-day period.  The council shall hold a hearing on any such appeal promptly, and shall thereafter issue a decision upholding, modifying or abrogating the commissioner's order of abatement or any part thereof.  The council's decision shall become final 10 days after it is issued.  Upon a finding by the commissioner that there is an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment, the commissioner shall issue an order of abatement requiring immediate compliance and said order shall be final and enforceable upon issuance, but may be appealed to the council within 30 days of its issuance, and the council may, after hearing, uphold, modify, or abrogate said order.

Whenever the commissioner or his authorized representative finds that a gasoline dispensing facility subject to Stage II vapor recovery system requirements has resulted in a violation of any provisions of this chapter or the rules in force hereunder, the commissioner or authorized representative shall issue a stop use order and compliance schedule with which the gasoline dispensing facility shall comply.  Any stop use order shall become final and enforceable upon issuance, but may be appealed to the council within 10 days of its issuance and the council, after hearing, may uphold, modify, or abrogate such order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Rehearings and appeals from a decision of the commissioner under this paragraph shall be in accordance with RSA 541.
