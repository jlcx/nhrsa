&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 126-D:1 Legislative Findings and Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following is hereby found and declared:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Locating adoptive families for hard to place children for whom adoption assistance is provided under RSA 170-F, and assuring the continued protection of the interests of the children affected during the entire assistance period, require special measures when the adoptive parents move to other states or are residents of another state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The provision of medical and other necessary services for such children creates special difficulties when the provision of these services takes place in other states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Children living in this state whose resident adoptive parents receive on their behalf adoption assistance from another state should be afforded comparable protection and medical and other services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. It is, therefore, the policy of the state, by entering into compacts with other party states and by working cooperatively with other states, to ensure that medical and other necessary services continue to be available and provided to these children so long as adoption assistance payments are made to their adoptive parents.
