<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no individual or member of the individual's family shall be required to undergo genetic testing as a condition of doing business with another person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as required to establish paternity under RSA 522, or as required to test newborns for metabolic disorders under RSA 132:10-a, or as required for purposes of criminal investigations and prosecutions, or as is necessary to the functions of the office of chief medical examiner, no genetic testing shall be done in this state on any individual or anywhere on any resident of this state based on bodily materials obtained within this state, without the prior written and informed consent of the individual to be tested, the parent, guardian, or custodian if the individual is a minor under the age of 18, or the legal guardian or conservator if the individual is an incompetent person.  The results of any such test shall be provided only to those persons approved in writing by the individual, the parent, guardian, or custodian if the individual is a minor under the age of 18, or the legal guardian or conservator if the individual is an incompetent person.  No person shall refuse to perform genetic testing, or to arrange for genetic testing to be performed, or to do business with an individual, solely because the individual to be tested refuses to consent to providing the test results to some or all persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in paragraph II, or authorized by RSA 141-J, no person shall disclose to any other person that an individual has undergone genetic testing, and no person shall disclose the results of such testing to any other person, without the prior written and informed consent of the individual, the parent, guardian, or custodian if the individual is a minor under the age of 18, or the legal guardian or conservator if the individual is an incompetent person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall be construed to regulate or apply to genetic testing or genetic analysis used for diagnosis and treatment of a patient by a clinical laboratory that has received a specimen referral from the individual patient's treating physician, genetic counselor, or another clinical laboratory.  Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to waive the requirement that the treating physician obtain specific informed consent in accordance with the provisions of this section.
