<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Actual provider costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Information and testimony gathered from a public hearing, held as part of the biennial rate setting process, at which time providers, beneficiaries and their representatives, and other concerned residents shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the rates, rate setting methodologies, and justifications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Applicable state and federal law and regulations relative to specific Medicaid services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

On or before October 1 prior to each biennial legislative session and prior to submitting the department's budget request under RSA 9:4, the department of health and human services shall submit a report relative to the reimbursement rates, the methodologies underlying the establishment of such rates, and justifications for such rates to the speaker of the house of representatives, the senate president, the house clerk, the senate clerk, the state library, and the health and human services oversight committee established in RSA 126-A:13.  The report also shall be used to formulate the department's budget request under RSA 9:4.
<br>
