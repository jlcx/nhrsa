<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as specified in subparagraph III(c), the term "usual and customary'' means the lowest charge, fee, or rate charged by a provider for any product or service at the time such product or service was provided.  For the purpose of determining the lowest charge, fee, or rate:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the provider offers discounts or rebates, then the amount after applying discounts or rebates shall be utilized;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the provider offers a sale for a limited period of time on any good or service, then the sale price shall be utilized during the sale period;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the provider regularly accepts less than its full charge from any customer, then the amount accepted shall be utilized;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If any good or service is offered free of charge by the provider, then no charge shall be made to the department for the provision of the product or service to the department or a client of the department who satisfies the terms of the offer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) If any good or service is covered under any warranty or guarantee offered by the provider, then the amount charged to the department shall not exceed the amount which would otherwise be payable solely by the customer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) If a provider structures or packages its goods or services in a manner which is exclusively or primarily used for medicaid, medicare, or other third-party payors, then the charge for the most similar good or service offered to any other consumer shall be utilized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The following items shall not be utilized in determining the "usual and customary'' or lowest charge, fee, or rate:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Charges for educational-related services governed by 42 U.S.C. 1396b(c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commissioner may waive the application of RSA 126-A:3, III if the commissioner determines such action is necessary to ensure a continuum of care and service to persons served by community mental health centers, to avert serious economic hardships to mental health centers, or to ensure that hospitals may contract for wholesale hospital-to-hospital laboratory and testing services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When a person is being assisted by a city, town, or county in the purchase of a drug product, pursuant to RSA 165 or RSA 166, no provider of pharmaceutical services shall bill or charge the person, city, town, or county for the drug product at a rate in excess of the rate that would be billed or charged the department of health and human services for that product.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner determines that the department has been charged more than the usual or customary fee, charge or rate as set forth in this section, the commissioner may levy a penalty against the provider of the good or service in the amount of 10 percent of the overcharge or $100, whichever is greater.  Moneys received under this paragraph shall be deposited into the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Pharmacists shall substitute generically equivalent drug products for all legend and non-legend prescriptions paid for by the department of health and human services, including the Medicaid program, unless the prescribing practitioner specifies that the brand name drug product is medically necessary.  Such notification shall be in the practitioner's own handwriting and shall be retained in the pharmacist's file.  The provisions of paragraph III shall not apply to the dispensing by a pharmacy for medical assistance reimbursement for legend and non-legend drugs.  The commissioner, in consultation with pharmacy providers, shall establish medical assistance reimbursement for legend and non-legend drugs.  For Medicaid fee for service clients, no prior authorization for generically equivalent drugs shall be required.
