<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The parent of a child described in paragraph II may be authorized by the department to provide home health aide services to his or her child if the parent:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is employed by a licensed home health agency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Is reimbursed through the Medicaid program for the care of his or her child only;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Meets the undue hardship standard in paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A child is eligible for home health aide services if the child is medically fragile or has a chronic illness and such child:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is aged birth to 19;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Has a medical diagnosis of an acute onset medical condition or a chronic medical condition;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Requires a nursing facility or hospital level of care, as defined in RSA 167:3-g;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Resides at home;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Is determined eligible for the home health aide service through the use of a standardized rating tool developed by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department may authorize reimbursement to a parent providing home health aide services in the case of undue hardship.  Subject to approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this section shall apply only to families whose income is no greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty limit.  Such reimbursement shall occur only when the department determines that the needs of the child, the unavailability of appropriate providers or suitable alternative care services, and cost efficiencies make utilization of a parent for the provision of such services necessary and appropriate.  Reimbursement shall be limited to care that is medically necessary due to specific health needs and shall not be made for care generally expected and provided by parents to a child of similar age and developmental stage.  The department shall not authorize reimbursement to a parent until a plan and rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A, are reviewed and approved by the oversight committee on health and human services, established in RSA 126-A:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall establish a Medicaid reimbursement rate for home health aide services.  Such reimbursement rate shall be based on the current average wage of personal care workers reimbursed through the Medicaid program and the cost of nursing supervision required by federal law for unskilled care.  The annual expenditure for such service shall not exceed $25,000 per child and the home health agency shall not retain more than 10 percent of the Medicaid reimbursement rate received for the home health aide service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No more than 10 Medicaid-eligible children may receive home health aide services under the program at any given time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The department shall operate the program established in this section as a 3-year pilot program, beginning July 1, 2011, at the end of which time the department shall evaluate its success and recommend its continuation, expansion, or conclusion.  The department of health and human services shall provide an annual report on the pilot program to the fiscal committee of the general court.  The report shall be filed with the chairperson of the committee by July 1 of each year beginning July 1, 2012.
