<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When a person is being assisted by a city, town, or county in the purchase of a drug product, pursuant to RSA 165 or RSA 166, no provider of pharmaceutical services shall bill or charge the person, city, town, or county for the drug product at a rate in excess of the rate that would be billed or charged the department of health and human services for that product.

(b) If such person dies while a resident of the institution, subject to provisions of RSA 126-A:43, II, recovery is limited to the expense incurred within the 5 years immediately preceding death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If such person is discharged from the institution, subject to the provisions of RSA 126-A:43, II, recovery is limited to the expense incurred within the 5 years immediately preceding discharge.

The commissioner shall establish for any patient, resident, or client of an institution, facility, or program named in RSA 126-A:34, a uniform rate to cover the expenses of the several categories of service provided to patients, residents, or clients such as but not necessarily limited to the following:  intensive medical care, treatment, and maintenance;  intensive psychiatric care, treatment, and maintenance;  and custodial care, treatment, and maintenance.  The commissioner is not required to establish such rate by rules adopted under RSA 541-A.  The categories or classifications of service provided may be modified by the commissioner.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After any person has been a resident or patient in any of the institutions named in RSA 126-A:34 for 10 years or has reached the age of majority, the liability of persons other than the patient or resident or such patient's or resident's spouse to provide payments to cover the expenses of care, treatment, and maintenance shall cease, except for recoveries from the estates of such persons which shall be limited as provided in RSA 126-A:42, II.  The liability of a spouse under RSA 126-A:36 shall cease after the person has been a patient or resident of any of the institutions named in RSA 126-A:34 for 10 years.  The liability of the patient or resident under this paragraph shall continue unless it is determined by the office of reimbursements, in consultation with the commissioner, that the patient or resident lacks sufficient income from any source including, but not limited to, social security, retirement, civil service or veterans administration income, trust fund, or other income to pay a full rate or a higher partial rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may compromise or reduce any debt or obligation owed to the state pursuant to an agreement with a group health plan carrier, as defined in RSA 420-G:2, or any health insurer as defined in 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. section 1167(1), federal and or state funded assistance, or any other legally liable third party or persons chargeable for support.

The legislature finds that the inability of individual citizens to amass sufficient funds for housing security deposits contributes significantly to the problem of homelessness in the state of New Hampshire;  that a program of security deposit guarantees which is coordinated with other programs that address rental housing security could assist in alleviating that problem;  that it is possible, and desirable, to structure and implement such a program without threatening the fiscal health of the state;  that the financial health of the state shall indeed be served by enabling private housing opportunities;  and that such a program is necessary for the public good, health, welfare, and stability of the state.
