&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 126-A:50 Declaration of Purpose and Findings Regarding Housing Security. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The legislature finds that the inability of individual citizens to amass sufficient funds for housing security deposits contributes significantly to the problem of homelessness in the state of New Hampshire;  that a program of security deposit guarantees which is coordinated with other programs that address rental housing security could assist in alleviating that problem;  that it is possible, and desirable, to structure and implement such a program without threatening the fiscal health of the state;  that the financial health of the state shall indeed be served by enabling private housing opportunities;  and that such a program is necessary for the public good, health, welfare, and stability of the state.
