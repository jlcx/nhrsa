I. The department shall develop and submit to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for approval a limited Medicaid expansion to provide for transitional Medicaid eligibility for children whose eligibility for Healthy Kids Gold terminates mid-month and who are eligible for Healthy Kids Silver but will not receive Healthy Kids Silver coverage until the first of the month following Healthy Kids Gold ineligibility.  Coverage of Medicaid services during the transition period shall be funded using State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds.

II. On or before January 10, 2010, the department of health and human services shall submit a report to the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, and the governor verifying the steps the department has taken to implement the transitional program and ensure that there is no gap in coverage for children transferring from healthy kids gold to silver.
