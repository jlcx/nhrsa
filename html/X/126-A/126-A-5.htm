The commissioner further may receive, expend, control, convey, hold in trust, or invest any funds or real or personal property given or devised to or owned by any facility as the commissioner deems appropriate or expedient.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the appeals process shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A jurisdictional review by the commissioner, or a hearings examiner designated by the commissioner, to determine whether a denial or change in services, benefits, or a license is automatic due entirely to a change in state or federal law.  In the event the department's action is due entirely to such a change in state or federal law, the department shall provide adequate notice and provide the applicant, recipient, or licensee the opportunity to state the reasons he or she believes issues of fact or interpretation of law should be heard, prior to the commissioner or hearings examiner designated by the commissioner conducting a jurisdictional review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the commissioner, or hearings examiner designated by the commissioner determines that sole issue on appeal is the result of the state or federal law that caused a denial or change in services, benefits, or a license, and the appeal does not require resolution of a factual disagreement or legal issue, then an order dismissing the appeal shall be issued by the commissioner, or a hearings examiner designated by the commissioner, after such jurisdictional review and without an administrative hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In all other cases, if the automatic result of the new state or federal law is not the only issue on appeal, then an administrative hearing shall be conducted by the commissioner, or a hearings examiner designated by the commissioner, to address the other issues in accordance with rules established by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For appeals of all other matters, the commissioner, or a hearings examiner designated by the commissioner, shall conduct an administrative hearing in accordance with the rules established by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless the commissioner has delegated to the hearings examiner authority to issue a decision on behalf of the department, following the hearing, the hearings examiner shall submit to the commissioner a proposed decision which shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A statement of the issues presented in the appeal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(3) Proposed findings of fact and rulings of law;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A proposed order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If following a hearing the proposed decision is adverse to the individual applying for or receiving services, facility or employee who made the appeal, or if the commissioner proposes to make an adverse finding, ruling, or order which the hearings examiner has not recommended, the commissioner shall provide the appealing party with a copy of the commissioner's proposed decision and offer an opportunity to submit a brief and make an oral argument regarding the contested findings of fact, rulings of law, or proposed order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Following a review of a proposed decision after a hearing and of a brief and argument in a contested case, if any, the commissioner shall issue a final decision on the appeal.

X. The commissioner may assess and collect reasonable fees for the duplication of materials made pursuant to RSA 91-A:4 and for material generally available to the public upon request.  Such fees shall be based on an amount necessary to recover the cost of producing such documents, regardless of the type of medium used.  Fees paid to the department of health and human services shall be continually appropriated to the department.  Local, state and federal agencies shall be exempted from these fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, implementing procedures for state registry and criminal background investigations of all new department staff who have regular contact with children, according to the provisions of RSA 170-G:8-c.

In addition, the same disclosure shall be made when there has been a fatality, to include suicide, or near fatality of a child under the legal supervision or legal custody of the department.  In determining whether disclosure will be contrary to the best interests of the child, the child's siblings, or other children in the household, the commissioner shall consider the privacy interests of the child and the child's family and the effects which disclosure may have on efforts to reunite and provide services for the family.  If the commissioner determines not to release the information, the commissioner shall provide written findings in support of the decision to the requestor.
