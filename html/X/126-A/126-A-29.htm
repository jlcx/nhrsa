(a) With respect to grants for a new shelter or additional beds for an existing shelter:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) With respect to grants for supportive and preventive services, that such assistance will enable persons assisted to obtain permanent housing and that such services are for the public use and the public benefit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the grant is to be made to a religious organization, it must have a primary effect of neither advancing nor inhibiting religion.  In awarding grants under this subdivision, the department shall give substantial weight to the performance record and general stability of the grant applicant.
