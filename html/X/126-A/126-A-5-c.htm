<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Program'' means the New Hampshire health protection program under RSA 126-A:5, XXIV-XXV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Remainder amount'' means the cost of the program for coverage effective between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2017 plus administrative costs attributable to the program, less all federal reimbursement for the program and federal reimbursement for the related administrative costs;  and the cost of the program for coverage effective between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018, plus administrative costs attributable to the program, less all federal reimbursement for the program and federal reimbursement for administrative costs attributable to the program, and taxes attributable to premiums written for medical and other medical related services for the newly eligible Medicaid population as provided for under RSA 126-A:5, XXIV-XXVI, consistent with RSA 400-A:32, III(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Funding for the program from January 1, 2017 until December 31, 2018 shall not be funded from general funds.  The program shall be funded as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Federal funds as made available by 42 U.S.C. section 1396d(y)(1).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Revenue generated under RSA 400-A:32, III(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Other non-general fund revenues.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the commissioner determines that at any time the sum total of the federal match rate applied, as set forth in 42 U.S.C. section 1396d(y)(1), and insurance premium tax revenues attributable to the program and revenue from non-general fund sources is insufficient to fully fund the program for newly eligible adults under RSA 126-A:5, XXIV-XXV, then RSA 126-A:5, XXIV and XXV shall be repealed 180 days after such determination upon notification by the commissioner of the department of health and human services to the secretary of state and the director of legislative services and consistent with the terms of the waiver for this program issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  Upon such determination, the commissioner shall immediately issue notice to program participants of the program's pending repeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. On or before August 15th of each year, the department of health and human services, in consultation with the insurance department, shall calculate the remainder amount pursuant to this section for the next calendar year.  The remainder amount shall be calculated utilizing estimated insurance premium taxes attributable to medical and other medical-related services for the newly eligible Medicaid population as provided for under RSA 126-A:5, XXIV-XXVI for each calendar year.  The commissioner of health and human services shall report the remainder amounts to the insurance department, any contributing charitable foundation, the New Hampshire Health Plan, the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the senate president.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. After the close of each calendar year, on or before January 15th, the department of health and human services, in consultation with the insurance department, shall recalculate the remainder amount utilizing actual insurance premium tax revenues attributable to medical and other medical-related services for the newly eligible Medicaid population provided for under RSA 126-A:5, XXIV-XXVI for the completed calendar year.  The commissioner of health and human services shall compare the remainder amount calculations under this paragraph with the remainder amount calculations under paragraph IV and report the results to the insurance department, any contributing charitable foundation, the New Hampshire Health Plan, the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the senate president.  Any difference between amounts calculated under paragraphs IV and V for a completed calendar year shall be added to the remainder amount due and payable during the current calendar year.  In the event that actual program costs are less than funds received, the difference shall be credited against the remaining amount for the next payable period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall be responsible for determining, on a quarterly basis commencing no later than December 31, 2016, whether there is sufficient funding in the New Hampshire health protection trust fund, established in RSA 126-A:5-b, to cover projected program costs for the non-federal share for the next quarter.  If at any time the commissioner determines that a projected shortfall exists, he or she shall terminate the program in accordance with paragraph III.
