<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide an epinephrine auto-injector to any individual who the employee agent or other individual believes in good faith is experiencing anaphylaxis, or the parent, guardian, or caregiver of such individual, for immediate administration, regardless of whether the individual has a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector or has previously been diagnosed with an allergy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Administer an epinephrine auto-injector to any individual who the employee, agent, or other individual believes in good faith is experiencing anaphylaxis, regardless of whether the individual has a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector or has previously been diagnosed with an allergy.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
