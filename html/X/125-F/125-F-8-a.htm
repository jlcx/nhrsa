<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established the New Hampshire low-level radioactive waste management fund to be used for the purposes of this section.  This nonlapsing, revolving special fund is hereby continually appropriated to be expended by the department of health and human services in accordance with this section.  Money collected under this section but not needed to meet the obligations of the department of health and human services under this section shall be deposited in the New Hampshire low-level radioactive waste management fund.  The state treasurer shall invest the moneys so deposited as provided by law.  Interest received on investments made by the state treasurer shall also be credited to the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The fund shall be used to provide for the adequate and safe management and disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within New Hampshire.  After the governor certifies that circumstances require the use of the fund, the department of health and human services may enter into contracts, agreements, or consultative services and use the fund for the following purposes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Paying any disposal costs and associated surcharges for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Hiring of consultants and personnel;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Purchase, lease or rental of necessary equipment;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Other necessary expenses directly associated with the management and disposal of low-level radioactive waste.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every generator of low-level radioactive waste located in this state which exports the waste for disposal shall pay quarterly a low-level radioactive waste generator fee to the department of health and human services.  This quarterly fee shall be based on a per cubic foot of waste exported.  The commissioner shall, by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A, establish a schedule of low-level radioactive waste generator fees.  The department of health and human services shall forward the fees collected under this paragraph to the state treasurer for deposit in the low-level radioactive waste management fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any low-level radioactive waste disposal surcharge collected by the appropriate federal agency pursuant to the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, and returned to the state of New Hampshire shall also be deposited in the low-level radioactive waste management fund.
