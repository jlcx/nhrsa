<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To institute and maintain a regulatory program for sources of radiation to provide (a) compatibility and consistency with the standards and regulation within the state, and (b) a system consonant insofar as possible with those of other states;  and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-F:11 Surety Requirement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For licensed activities involving low-level radioactive waste, the department through its program shall, and for other classes of licensed activity, the department, through its program, may adopt by rule standards and procedures to ensure that the licensees shall provide an adequate surety or other financial arrangement to permit the completion of all requirements established by the department through its program for the decontamination, decommissioning, closure, and reclamation of sites, structures, and equipment used in conjunction with such licensed activity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All sureties under paragraph I which are forfeited shall be paid to the department for deposit by the state treasurer in the radiation long-term care fund, established by RSA 6:12, I(b)(20).  All moneys in this fund are hereby continually appropriated and may be expended by the department as necessary to complete such requirements on which licensees have defaulted.  Moneys in the fund shall not be used for normal operating expenses of the program or any other component of the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For licensed activities which will require surveillance or control after the licensed activity ceases, the department, through its program, shall adopt by rule, standards and procedures to ensure that the licensee, before termination of the license, shall make available such funding arrangements as necessary to provide for long-term site surveillance and control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All funds collected from licensees under paragraph III shall be paid to the department for deposit by the state treasurer in the radiation long-term care fund, established by RSA 6:12, I(b)(20).  All funds accrued as interest on moneys deposited in this fund are hereby continually appropriated and may be expended by the department for the continuing long-term surveillance, maintenance and other care of facilities from which such funds are collected as necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and environment.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, if title to and custody of any radioactive material and its disposal site are transferred to the United States upon termination of any license but for which funds had been collected for such long-term care, the collected funds and interest accrued thereon shall be transferred to the United States;  provided, however, that such funds do not include moneys held in surety where no default has occurred and a reclamation for other bonded activity has been performed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The sureties or financial arrangements and funds required by paragraphs I and III shall be established in amounts sufficient to ensure compliance with standards, if any, established by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission or successor thereto pertaining to reclamation and long-term site surveillance and control of such facilities and sites.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In order to provide for the proper care and surveillance of sites subject to paragraph III, the state may acquire by gift or transfer from another government agency or private person, any land or appurtenances necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section.  Any such gift or transfer is subject to approval and acceptance by the state in accordance with RSA 4:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. All lands, buildings, and ground acquired by the state under paragraph VI shall be owned in fee simple absolute by the state and dedicated in perpetuity to the purpose of this section.  All radioactive material received at the site and located therein, at the time of acquisition of ownership by the state or thereafter, shall become the property of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The department, through its program, may enter into contracts, agreements, leases, or licenses with any person, including another state agency, to provide for the decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, surveillance, or other care of a site subject to this section, as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If a person licensed by any state or federal agency other than by the program desires to transfer a site to the state in accordance with RSA 4:8 for the purpose of administering or providing perpetual care, a lump sum deposit shall be made to the radiation long-term care fund.  The amount of the deposit shall be determined by the program, taking into account the factors stated in paragraphs III and V of this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-F:22 Civil Penalties. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who violates any license or registration provision of this chapter or any rule or order issued thereunder, or any term, condition, or limitation of any license or registration certificate issued thereunder, or commits any violation for which a license or registration certificate may be revoked under rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, may be subject to a civil penalty, to be imposed by the department.  The department, through its program, shall adopt by rule a schedule of civil penalties graduated by degree of severity of the violation.  If any violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate violation for the purpose of computing the applicable civil penalty.  The department shall have the power to compromise, mitigate, or remit such penalties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the department through its program proposes to subject a person to the imposition of a civil penalty under the provisions of this section it shall notify such person in writing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Setting forth the date, facts, and nature of each act or omission for which the person is charged;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Specifically identifying the particular provision or provisions of the law, rule, order, license, or registration certificate involved in the violation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Advising the person of each penalty which the department imposes and its amount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The written notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail by the program to the last known address of such person.  The person so notified shall be granted an opportunity to show in writing within such reasonable period as the program by rule may prescribe, why such penalty should not be imposed.  The notice shall also advise such person that upon failure to pay the civil penalty subsequently determined by the department, if any, the penalty may be collected by civil action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon request of the department of health and human services, the department of justice is authorized to institute civil action to collect a penalty imposed pursuant to this section.  The attorney general shall have the exclusive power to compromise, mitigate, or remit such civil penalties as are referred to him for collection.  All civil penalties collected under this section shall be forwarded to the state treasurer.  The state treasurer shall deposit all moneys received under this section, and interest received on such money, to the public health services special fund, which shall be nonlapsing.
