<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Standards and procedures for the testing and certification of lead abatement workers and lead clearance testing technicians, in accordance with RSA 130-A:12.  The rules shall provide for reciprocity with other states having similar standards.

Property owners who own more than 4 but fewer than 7 dwelling units shall pay a fee for licensure which is  1/2 of that paid by other lead abatement contractor licensees.
