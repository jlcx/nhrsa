The commissioner shall provide the findings of the inspection to the occupant and to the owner or the owner's agent.  If the leased or rented dwelling has multiple units, and if a lead exposure hazard is determined to exist during an investigation conducted under RSA 130-A:5, the commissioner shall conduct inspections of all other dwelling units of the leased or rented dwelling with the owner or owner's agent for the purposes of identifying the presence of lead base substances.

The inspection shall be conducted with the consent of the owner, manager, or other person in charge of the facility or structure at a time convenient to the owner, manager or other person in charge.  Such inspections shall be made only when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a lead exposure hazard may exist.  The commissioner shall provide to the owner, manager or other person in charge the result of the inspection.  When a lead exposure hazard is determined to exist, the commissioner shall provide to the owner, manager or other person in charge, the child's health care provider and the health authority a notice and shall also provide information on the health consequences of lead poisoning and procedures for lead hazard reduction.
