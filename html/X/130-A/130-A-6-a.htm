&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Eviction of a tenant based on the presence in the dwelling or dwelling unit of a child who has tested positive for the presence of lead in his or her bloodstream shall be unlawful.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any eviction action, instituted by the owner within 6 months of receipt of notice of a child's elevated blood lead level by the department, the child's physician, or the child's parent or guardian, is based on the child's elevated blood level;  provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the notice came from a parent or guardian only, such parent or guardian shall provide the owner with a copy of the child's blood test prior to the expiration of the eviction notice for the rebuttable presumption in this subparagraph to apply;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) This subparagraph shall not be construed to alter any cause for eviction under RSA 540:2.
