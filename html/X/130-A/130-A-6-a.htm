&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 130-A:6-a Property Owner Notification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall make reasonable efforts to notify in writing the owner of a dwelling or dwelling unit where the child resides if lead levels of 6 to 9.9 micrograms per deciliter are found in the child's blood.  Such notice to the property owner shall specify that it is neither a finding that a lead exposure hazard exists in the property nor is it an order for lead hazard reduction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Eviction of a tenant based on the presence in the dwelling or dwelling unit of a child with a blood level of 6 to 9.9 micrograms per deciliter shall be unlawful.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any eviction action, instituted by the owner within 6 months of receipt of the notice sent by the department pursuant to paragraph I, is based on the child's elevated blood lead level;  provided that this shall not be construed to alter any cause for eviction under RSA 540:2.  If a court finds that an eviction is based on the child's elevated blood lead level, it shall deny the eviction and award damages to the tenant pursuant to RSA 540:14, II. However, if an owner in response to the notice from the department discovers a lead exposure hazard in the dwelling or dwelling unit, the owner may proceed with relocation of the tenants, provided that the owner meets the requirements of RSA 130-A:8-a, I or II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Refusal of a tenant to permit the owner to have access to the dwelling or dwelling unit in order to inspect for lead exposure hazards shall be good cause for eviction pursuant to RSA 540:2, II(e);  provided, however, that the owner gives the tenant at least 48 hours' prior written notice, and that the inspection is to be conducted at a reasonable time.
