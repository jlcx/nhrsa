&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 130-A:18 Civil Suits.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Owners of pre-1978 rental housing and childcare facilities shall take reasonable care to prevent exposure to, and the creation of, lead hazards.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the mere presence of a lead base substance shall not constitute negligence on the part of an owner of any dwelling.  To establish negligence on the part of an owner, the plaintiff in a civil suit shall demonstrate actual injury caused by the lead base substance.  Evidence of actions taken or not taken by the owner of a pre-1978 rental property or childcare facility in compliance with applicable public health laws and regulations concerning lead may be admissible evidence of reasonable care or negligence.  Remedial actions taken by a property owner after a lead exposure has occurred shall not be admissible evidence for purposes of establishing liability.  Evidence of a tenant's disturbance of painted surfaces containing lead paint also shall be admissible evidence.  In addition, the mere presence of a lead base substance in a dwelling shall not by itself violate any warranty of habitability.
