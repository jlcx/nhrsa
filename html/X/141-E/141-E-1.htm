<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that exposure to asbestos fibers over time has been linked by medical and scientific authorities to a significant increase in the incidence of diseases, such as asbestosis, bronchogenic carcinoma, mesothelioma, and other malignancies, and that such diseases place unnecessary and preventable burdens on society while depriving the victims of livelihood, well-being, and life.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court also finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Abatement of asbestos from workplaces, schools, public facilities, and dwellings, which is carried out to reduce the exposure of the public to this health threat, further jeopardizes public health when the abatement is done without adequate safeguards and by unqualified individuals;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Asbestos disposal sites pose a potential threat to human health if improperly managed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Therefore, in order to protect the health of the public from this threat, it shall be the policy of the state to establish and enforce asbestos exposure standards and to control the exposure of the public to asbestos by regulation of asbestos abatement and asbestos disposal site activities.  The intent of this chapter is not to overburden the unknowing homeowner, but rather to assure commercial and industrial compliance with asbestos disposal site regulation and asbestos abatement efforts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Relative to asbestos abatement activities, as defined by RSA 141-E:2, II, it shall be the responsibility of the department of environmental services, to carry out this policy in accordance with RSA 141-E:3 and RSA 141-E:6-11, and in such a manner as to avoid direct conflict with other state and federal requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Relative to management of asbestos disposal sites, as defined by RSA 141-E:2, III, it shall be the responsibility of the department of environmental services to carry out this policy in accordance with RSA 141-E:3 and RSA 141-E:21-25, in lieu of RSA 149-M as previously carried out, and in such a manner as to avoid direct conflict with other state and federal requirements.
