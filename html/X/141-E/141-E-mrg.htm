&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 141-E:1 Statement of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that exposure to asbestos fibers over time has been linked by medical and scientific authorities to a significant increase in the incidence of diseases, such as asbestosis, bronchogenic carcinoma, mesothelioma, and other malignancies, and that such diseases place unnecessary and preventable burdens on society while depriving the victims of livelihood, well-being, and life.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court also finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Abatement of asbestos from workplaces, schools, public facilities, and dwellings, which is carried out to reduce the exposure of the public to this health threat, further jeopardizes public health when the abatement is done without adequate safeguards and by unqualified individuals;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Asbestos disposal sites pose a potential threat to human health if improperly managed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Therefore, in order to protect the health of the public from this threat, it shall be the policy of the state to establish and enforce asbestos exposure standards and to control the exposure of the public to asbestos by regulation of asbestos abatement and asbestos disposal site activities.  The intent of this chapter is not to overburden the unknowing homeowner, but rather to assure commercial and industrial compliance with asbestos disposal site regulation and asbestos abatement efforts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Relative to asbestos abatement activities, as defined by RSA 141-E:2, II, it shall be the responsibility of the department of environmental services, to carry out this policy in accordance with RSA 141-E:3 and RSA 141-E:6-11, and in such a manner as to avoid direct conflict with other state and federal requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Relative to management of asbestos disposal sites, as defined by RSA 141-E:2, III, it shall be the responsibility of the department of environmental services to carry out this policy in accordance with RSA 141-E:3 and RSA 141-E:21-25, in lieu of RSA 149-M as previously carried out, and in such a manner as to avoid direct conflict with other state and federal requirements.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever the commissioner has reason to suspect the presence of RACM in any public building, facility, school, or rental dwelling, the commissioner may cause inspections to be carried out.  If RACM is found in damaged or deteriorated condition or if conditions exist which could result in significant human exposure or if asbestos levels exceeding 0.01 fibers longer than 5 microns per cubic centimeter of air as determined by OSHA/NIOSH phase contrast optical microscopy methods are found, the commissioner may order corrective action to abate the risk to the health of the public.  The order may, at the discretion of the commissioner, include notice of closure of access under RSA 141-E:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event that asbestos levels exceed the standards set in RSA 141-E:6, I or II, there may be a second test of samples collected over an 8-hour period or as otherwise approved by the department, analyzed by scanning or transmission electron microscopy analysis before any order of abatement is issued.  The results of the scanning or transmission electron microscopy analysis, which shall be recorded in terms of the number of asbestos fibers longer than 5 micrometers per cubic centimeter of air in accordance with OSHA standard definitions for asbestos monitoring, shall prevail in the determination of whether the standard is exceeded.  Such tests shall be paid for by the owner of the building or facility being analyzed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may, upon request of the owner, inspect private dwellings for the presence of RACM.  If RACM is found, the commissioner shall make recommendations to the owner for its abatement.  The commissioner shall charge a fee for such inspections under RSA 141-E:12.
