I. Where there are multiple surrogate decision-makers at the same priority level in the hierarchy, it shall be the responsibility of those surrogates to make reasonable efforts to reach a consensus as to their decision on behalf of the patient regarding any health care decision.  If 2 or more surrogates who are in the same category and have equal priority indicate to the attending physician or APRN that they disagree about the health care decision at issue, a majority of the available persons in that category shall control, unless the minority or any other interested party initiates guardianship proceedings in accordance with RSA 464-A.  There shall not be a recognized surrogate when a guardianship proceeding has been initiated and a decision is pending.  The person initiating the petition for guardianship shall immediately provide written notice of the initiation of the guardianship proceeding to the health care facility where the patient is being treated.  This process shall not preempt the care of the patient.  No health care provider or other person shall be required to seek appointment of a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After a surrogate has been identified, the name, address, telephone number, and relationship of that person to the patient shall be recorded in the patient's medical record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any surrogate who becomes unavailable or unable or unwilling to act for any reason may be replaced by applying the provisions of RSA 137-J:35 in the same manner as for the initial choice of surrogate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the event an individual of a higher priority to an identified surrogate becomes available and is willing and able to be the surrogate, the individual with higher priority may be identified as the surrogate.  In the event an individual in a higher, a lower, or the same priority level or a health care provider seeks to challenge the priority or ability of the surrogate or the life-sustaining treatment decision of the recognized surrogate decision-maker, the challenging party may initiate guardianship proceedings in accordance with RSA 464-A.
