(Life-sustaining treatment is defined as procedures without which a person would die, such as but not limited to the following:  mechanical respiration, kidney dialysis or the use of other external mechanical and technological devices, drugs to maintain blood pressure, blood transfusions, and antibiotics.)  There is also a section which allows you to set forth specific directions for these or other matters.  If you wish, you may indicate your agreement or disagreement with any of the following statements and give your agent power to act in those specific circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. If I am near death and lack the capacity to make health care decisions, I authorize my agent to direct that:

___(b) life-sustaining treatment continue to be given to me.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(Initial beside your choice of (a) or (b).)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

II. LIVING WILL
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Declaration made this ___ day of __________, 20___.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I, __________, being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily make known my desire that my dying shall not be artificially prolonged under the circumstances set forth below, do hereby declare:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If at any time I should have an incurable injury, disease, or illness and I am certified to be near death or in a permanently unconscious condition by 2 physicians or a physician and an APRN, and 2 physicians or a physician and an APRN have determined that my death is imminent whether or not life-sustaining treatment is utilized and where the application of life-sustaining treatment would serve only to artificially prolong the dying process, or that I will remain in a permanently unconscious condition, I direct that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally with only the administration of medication, the natural ingestion of food or fluids by eating and drinking, or the performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide me with comfort care.  I realize that situations could arise in which the only way to allow me to die would be to discontinue medically administered nutrition and hydration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<b><i>(Initial below if it is your choice)</i></b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In carrying out any instruction I have given under this section, I authorize that even if all other forms of life-sustaining treatment have been withdrawn, medically administered nutrition and hydration continue to be given to me.  ______
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding the use of such life-sustaining treatment, it is my intention that this declaration shall be honored by my family and health care providers as the final expression of my right to refuse medical or surgical treatment and accept the consequences of such refusal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand the full import of this declaration, and I am emotionally and mentally competent to make this declaration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Signed this ___ day of __________, 2___.
