&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 137-J:1 Purpose and Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state of New Hampshire recognizes that a person has a right, founded in the autonomy and sanctity of the person, to control the decisions relating to the rendering of his or her own medical care.  In order that the rights of persons may be respected even after such persons lack the capacity to make health care decisions for themselves, and to encourage communication between patients and their attending physicians or APRNs, the general court declares that the laws of this state shall recognize the right of a competent person to make a written directive:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Delegating to an agent the authority to make health care decisions on the person's behalf, in the event such person is unable to make those decisions for himself or herself, either due to permanent or temporary lack of capacity to make health care decisions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Instructing his or her attending physician or APRN to provide, withhold, or withdraw life-sustaining treatment, in the event such person is near death or is permanently unconscious.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All persons have a right to make health care decisions, including the right to refuse cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  It is the purpose of the "Do Not Resuscitate'' provisions of this chapter to ensure that the right of a person to self-determination relating to cardiopulmonary resuscitation is protected, and to give direction to emergency services personnel and other health care providers in regard to the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph III effective January 1, 2015.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. While all persons have a right to make a written directive, not all take advantage of that right, and it is the purpose of the surrogacy provisions of this chapter to ensure that health care decisions can be made in a timely manner by a person's next of kin or loved one without involving court action.  This chapter specifies a process to establish a surrogate decision-maker when there is no valid advance directive or a guardian, as defined in RSA 464-A, to make health care decisions.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall at no time be construed as a suicide or murder for any legal purpose.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to constitute, condone, authorize, or approve suicide, assisted suicide, mercy killing, or euthanasia, or permit any affirmative or deliberate act or omission to end one's own life or to end the life of another other than either to permit the natural process of dying of a patient near death or the removal of life-sustaining treatment from a patient in a permanently unconscious condition as provided in this chapter.  The withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, however, shall not relieve any individual of responsibility for any criminal acts that may have caused the principal's condition.

IV. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to condone, authorize, or approve:
<br>

(a) The consent to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant principal, unless, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as certified on the principal's medical record by the attending physician or APRN and an obstetrician who has examined the principal, such treatment or procedures will not maintain the principal in such a way as to permit the continuing development and live birth of the fetus or will be physically harmful to the principal or prolong severe pain which cannot be alleviated by medication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The withholding or withdrawing of medically administered nutrition and hydration or life-sustaining treatment from a mentally incompetent or developmentally disabled person, unless such person has a validly executed advance directive or such action is authorized by an existing guardianship or other court order, or, in the absence of such directive, authorization, or order, such action is taken in accordance with the standard protocol of a health care facility licensed under RSA 151 as applicable to its general patient population.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this chapter shall impair or supersede any other legal right or responsibility which any person may have to effect life-sustaining treatment in any lawful manner;  provided, that this paragraph shall not be construed to authorize any violation of RSA 137-J:7, II or III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to revoke or adversely affect the privileges or immunities of health care providers or residential care providers and others to provide treatment to persons in need thereof in an emergency, as provided for under New Hampshire law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create a presumption that in the absence of an advance directive, a person wants life-sustaining treatment to be either taken or withdrawn.  This chapter shall also not be construed to supplant any existing rights and responsibilities under the law of this state governing the conduct of physicians or APRNs in consultation with patients or their families or legal guardians in the absence of an advance directive.

<center>
<p>
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LEGAL DOCUMENT.  BEFORE SIGNING IT, YOU SHOULD KNOW THESE IMPORTANT FACTS:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Except if you say otherwise in the directive, this directive gives the person you name as your health care agent the power to make any and all health care decisions for you when you lack the capacity to make health care decisions for yourself (in other words, you no longer have the ability to understand and appreciate generally the nature and consequences of a health care decision, including the significant benefits and harms of and reasonable alternatives to any proposed health care).  "Health care'' means any treatment, service or procedure to maintain, diagnose or treat your physical or mental condition.  Your health care agent, therefore, will have the power to make a wide range of health care decisions for you.  Your health care agent may consent (in other words, give permission) , refuse to consent, or withdraw consent to medical treatment, and may make decisions about withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment.  Your health care agent cannot consent to or direct any of the following:  commitment to a state institution, sterilization, or termination of treatment if you are pregnant and if the withdrawal of that treatment is deemed likely to terminate the pregnancy, unless the treatment will be physically harmful to you or prolong severe pain which cannot be alleviated by medication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You may state in this directive any treatment you do not want, or any treatment you want to be sure you receive.  Your health care agent's power will begin when your doctor certifies that you lack the capacity to make health care decisions (in other words, that you are not able to make health care decisions).  If for moral or religious reasons you do not want to be treated by a doctor or to be examined by a doctor to certify that you lack capacity, you must say so in the directive and you must name someone who can certify your lack of capacity.  That person cannot be your health care agent or alternate health care agent or any person who is not eligible to be your health care agent.  You may attach additional pages to the document if you need more space to complete your statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If you want to give your health care agent power to withhold or withdraw medically administered nutrition and hydration, you must say so in your directive.  Otherwise, your health care agent will not be able to direct that.  Under no conditions will your health care agent be able to direct the withholding of food and drink that you are able to eat and drink normally.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Your agent shall be directed by your written instructions in this document when making decisions on your behalf, and as further guided by your medical condition or prognosis.  Unless you state otherwise in the directive, your agent will have the same power to make decisions about your health care as you would have made, if those decisions by your health care agent are made consistent with state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
It is important that you discuss this directive with your doctor or other health care providers before you sign it, to make sure that you understand the nature and range of decisions which could be made for you by your health care agent.  If you do not have a health care provider, you should talk with someone else who is knowledgeable about these issues and can answer your questions.  Check with your community hospital or hospice for trained staff.  You do not need a lawyer's assistance to complete this directive, but if there is anything in this directive that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The person you choose as your health care agent should be someone you know and trust, and he or she must be at least 18 years old.  If you choose your health or residential care provider (such as your doctor, advanced practice registered nurse, or an employee of a hospital, nursing home, home health agency, or residential care home, other than a relative), that person will have to choose between acting as your health care agent or as your health or residential care provider, because the law does not allow a person to do both at the same time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You should consider choosing an alternate health care agent, in case your health care agent is unwilling, unable, unavailable or not eligible to act as your health care agent.  Any alternate health care agent you choose will then have the same authority to make health care decisions for you.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You should tell the person you choose that you want him or her to be your health care agent.  You should talk about this directive with your health care agent and your doctor or advanced practice registered nurse and give each one a signed copy.  You should write on the directive itself the people and institutions who will have signed copies.  Your health care agent will not be liable for health care decisions made in good faith on your behalf.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 137-J:19 Durable Power of Attorney;  Disclosure Statement.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The disclosure statement which must accompany a durable power of attorney for health care shall be in substantially the following form:
<center>
<p>
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LEGAL DOCUMENT.  BEFORE SIGNING IT, YOU SHOULD KNOW THESE IMPORTANT FACTS:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Except if you say otherwise in the directive, this directive gives the person you name as your health care agent the power to make any and all health care decisions for you when you lack the capacity to make health care decisions for yourself (in other words, you no longer have the ability to understand and appreciate generally the nature and consequences of a health care decision, including the significant benefits and harms of and reasonable alternatives to any proposed health care).  "Health care'' means any treatment, service or procedure to maintain, diagnose or treat your physical or mental condition.  Your health care agent, therefore, will have the power to make a wide range of health care decisions for you.  Your health care agent may consent (in other words, give permission), refuse to consent, or withdraw consent to medical treatment, and may make decisions about withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment.  Your health care agent cannot consent to or direct any of the following:  commitment to a state institution, sterilization, or termination of treatment if you are pregnant and if the withdrawal of that treatment is deemed likely to terminate the pregnancy, unless the treatment will be physically harmful to you or prolong severe pain which cannot be alleviated by medication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You may state in this directive any treatment you do not want, or any treatment you want to be sure you receive.  Your health care agent's power will begin when your doctor certifies that you lack the capacity to make health care decisions (in other words, that you are not able to make health care decisions).  If for moral or religious reasons you do not want to be treated by a doctor or to be examined by a doctor to certify that you lack capacity, you must say so in the directive and you must name someone who can certify your lack of capacity.  That person cannot be your health care agent or alternate health care agent or any person who is not eligible to be your health care agent.  You may attach additional pages to the document if you need more space to complete your statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Under no conditions will your health care agent be able to direct the withholding of food and drink that you are able to eat and drink normally.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Your agent shall be directed by your written instructions in this document when making decisions on your behalf, and as further guided by your medical condition or prognosis.  Unless you state otherwise in the directive, your agent will have the same power to make decisions about your health care as you would have made, if those decisions by your health care agent are made consistent with state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
It is important that you discuss this directive with your doctor or other health care providers before you sign it, to make sure that you understand the nature and range of decisions which could be made for you by your health care agent.  If you do not have a health care provider, you should talk with someone else who is knowledgeable about these issues and can answer your questions.  Check with your community hospital or hospice for trained staff.  You do not need a lawyer's assistance to complete this directive, but if there is anything in this directive that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The person you choose as your health care agent should be someone you know and trust, and he or she must be at least 18 years old.  If you choose your health or residential care provider (such as your doctor, advanced practice registered nurse, or an employee of a hospital, nursing home, home health agency, or residential care home, other than a relative), that person will have to choose between acting as your health care agent or as your health or residential care provider, because the law does not allow a person to do both at the same time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You should consider choosing an alternate health care agent, in case your health care agent is unwilling, unable, unavailable or not eligible to act as your health care agent.  Any alternate health care agent you choose will then have the same authority to make health care decisions for you.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You should tell the person you choose that you want him or her to be your health care agent.  You should talk about this directive with your health care agent and your doctor or advanced practice registered nurse and give each one a signed copy.  You should write on the directive itself the people and institutions who will have signed copies.  Your health care agent will not be liable for health care decisions made in good faith on your behalf.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE SIGNED THIS DIRECTIVE, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF AS LONG AS YOU ARE ABLE TO DO SO, AND TREATMENT CANNOT BE GIVEN TO YOU OR STOPPED OVER YOUR CLEAR OBJECTION.  You have the right to revoke the power given to your health care agent by telling him or her, or by telling your health care provider, orally or in writing, that you no longer want that person to be your health care agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE OR STRIKE REFERENCES TO APRN'S IN YOUR ADVANCE DIRECTIVE AND IF YOU DO SO, YOUR ADVANCE DIRECTIVE SHALL STILL BE VALID AND ENFORCEABLE.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Once this directive is executed it cannot be changed or modified.  If you want to make changes, you must make an entirely new directive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY WILL NOT BE VALID UNLESS IT IS SIGNED IN THE PRESENCE OF A NOTARY PUBLIC OR JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OR TWO (2) OR MORE QUALIFIED WITNESSES, WHO MUST BOTH BE PRESENT WHEN YOU SIGN AND WHO WILL ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR SIGNATURE ON THE DOCUMENT.  THE FOLLOWING PERSONS MAY NOT ACT AS WITNESSES:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
___The person you have designated as your health care agent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
___Your spouse or heir at law;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
___Your attending physician or APRN, or person acting under the direction or control of the attending physician or APRN;

STATEMENT OF DESIRES, SPECIAL PROVISIONS, AND LIMITATIONS REGARDING HEALTH CARE DECISIONS.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
For your convenience in expressing your wishes, some general statements concerning the withholding or removal of life-sustaining treatment are set forth below.  (Life-sustaining treatment is defined as procedures without which a person would die, such as but not limited to the following:  mechanical respiration, kidney dialysis or the use of other external mechanical and technological devices, drugs to maintain blood pressure, blood transfusions, and antibiotics.)  There is also a section which allows you to set forth specific directions for these or other matters.  If you wish, you may indicate your agreement or disagreement with any of the following statements and give your agent power to act in those specific circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. If I am near death and lack the capacity to make health care decisions, I authorize my agent to direct that:

___(b) life-sustaining treatment continue to be given to me.

2. Whether near death or not, if I become permanently unconscious and life-sustaining treatment has no reasonable hope of benefit, I authorize my agent to direct that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(Initial beside your choice of (a) or (b).)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Declaration made this ___ day of __________, 20___.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I, __________, being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily make known my desire that my dying shall not be artificially prolonged under the circumstances set forth below, do hereby declare:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If at any time I should have an incurable injury, disease, or illness and I am certified to be near death or in a permanently unconscious condition by 2 physicians or a physician and an APRN, and 2 physicians or a physician and an APRN have determined that my death is imminent whether or not life-sustaining treatment is utilized and where the application of life-sustaining treatment would serve only to artificially prolong the dying process, or that I will remain in a permanently unconscious condition, I direct that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally with only the administration of medication, the natural ingestion of food or fluids by eating and drinking, or the performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide me with comfort care.  I realize that situations could arise in which the only way to allow me to die would be to discontinue medically administered nutrition and hydration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<b><i>(Initial below if it is your choice)</i></b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In carrying out any instruction I have given under this section, I authorize that even if all other forms of life-sustaining treatment have been withdrawn, medically administered nutrition and hydration continue to be given to me.  ______
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding the use of such life-sustaining treatment, it is my intention that this declaration shall be honored by my family and health care providers as the final expression of my right to refuse medical or surgical treatment and accept the consequences of such refusal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand the full import of this declaration, and I am emotionally and mentally competent to make this declaration.
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. On motion filed in connection with a petition for appointment of a guardian or on petition of a guardian if one has been appointed, the probate court shall consider whether the authority of an agent designated pursuant to an advance directive should be suspended or revoked.  In making its determination, the probate court shall take into consideration the preferences of the principal as expressed in the advance directive.  No such consideration shall change the procedures or burden of proof involved in the guardianship process as otherwise provided by law or procedures.  In such consideration, the advance directive and agent appointed shall be presumed to be in the best interest of the principal and valid, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.

II. To the extent that a durable power of attorney for health care, or such component of an advance directive as set forth in RSA 137-J:20, conflicts with a terminal care document or living will, or such component of an advance directive as set forth in RSA 137-J:20, the durable power of attorney for health care shall control.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Requesting that the authority granted to an agent by an advance directive be revoked on the grounds that the principal was not of sound mind or was under duress, fraud, or undue influence when the advance directive was executed, and shall have all the rights and remedies provided by RSA 506:7 which shall apply to directives executed under this chapter and persons acting pursuant to this chapter.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A copy of any such action shall be given in hand to the principal's attending physician or APRN and, as applicable, to the principal's health care provider or residential care provider.  To the extent they are not irreversibly implemented, health care decisions made by a challenged agent shall not thereafter be implemented without an order of the probate court or a withdrawal or dismissal of the court action;  provided, that this paragraph shall not be construed to authorize any violation of RSA 137-J:7, II or III.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 137-J:35 Surrogate Decision-making. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a patient lacks capacity to make health care decisions, the physician or APRN shall make a reasonable inquiry pursuant to 137-J:7 as to whether the patient has a valid advance directive and, to the extent that the patient has designated an agent, whether such agent is available, willing and able to act.  When no health care agent is authorized and available, the health care provider shall make a reasonable inquiry as to the availability of possible surrogates listed under this paragraph.  A surrogate decision-maker may make medical decisions on behalf of a patient without court order or judicial involvement in the following order of priority:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The patient's spouse, or civil union partner or common law spouse as defined by RSA 457:39, unless there is a divorce proceeding, separation agreement, or restraining order limiting that person's relationship with the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any adult son or daughter of the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Either parent of the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any adult brother or sister of the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any adult grandchild of the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any grandparent of the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Any adult aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A close friend of the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The agent with financial power of attorney or a conservator appointed in accordance with RSA 464-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The guardian of the patient's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The physician or APRN may identify a surrogate from the list in paragraph I if the physician or APRN determines he or she is able and willing to act, and determines after reasonable inquiry that neither a legal guardian, health care agent under a durable power of attorney for health care, nor a surrogate of higher priority is available and able and willing to act.  The surrogate decision-maker, as identified by the attending physician or APRN, may make health care decisions for the patient.  The surrogacy provisions of this chapter shall take effect when the decision-maker names are recorded in the medical record.  The physician or APRN shall have the right to rely on any of the above surrogates if the physician or APRN believes after reasonable inquiry that neither a health care agent under a durable power of attorney for health care or a surrogate of higher priority is available or able and willing to act.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 137-J:36 Determining Priority Among Multiple Surrogates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Where there are multiple surrogate decision-makers at the same priority level in the hierarchy, it shall be the responsibility of those surrogates to make reasonable efforts to reach a consensus as to their decision on behalf of the patient regarding any health care decision.  If 2 or more surrogates who are in the same category and have equal priority indicate to the attending physician or APRN that they disagree about the health care decision at issue, a majority of the available persons in that category shall control, unless the minority or any other interested party initiates guardianship proceedings in accordance with RSA 464-A.  There shall not be a recognized surrogate when a guardianship proceeding has been initiated and a decision is pending.  The person initiating the petition for guardianship shall immediately provide written notice of the initiation of the guardianship proceeding to the health care facility where the patient is being treated.  This process shall not preempt the care of the patient.  No health care provider or other person shall be required to seek appointment of a guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After a surrogate has been identified, the name, address, telephone number, and relationship of that person to the patient shall be recorded in the patient's medical record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any surrogate who becomes unavailable or unable or unwilling to act for any reason may be replaced by applying the provisions of RSA 137-J:35 in the same manner as for the initial choice of surrogate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the event an individual of a higher priority to an identified surrogate becomes available and is willing and able to be the surrogate, the individual with higher priority may be identified as the surrogate.  In the event an individual in a higher, a lower, or the same priority level or a health care provider seeks to challenge the priority or ability of the surrogate or the life-sustaining treatment decision of the recognized surrogate decision-maker, the challenging party may initiate guardianship proceedings in accordance with RSA 464-A.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 137-J:37 Limitations of Surrogacy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A surrogate shall not be identified over the express objection of the patient, and a surrogacy shall terminate if at any time a patient for whom a surrogate has been appointed expresses objection to the continuation of the surrogacy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No physician or APRN shall be required to identify a surrogate, and may, in the event a surrogate has been identified, revoke the surrogacy if the surrogate is unwilling or unable to act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A physician or APRN may, but shall not be required to, initiate guardianship proceedings or encourage a family member or friend to seek guardianship in the event a patient is determined to lack capacity to make health care decisions and no guardian, agent under a health care power of attorney, or surrogate has been appointed or named.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a physician or APRN to treat a patient who the physician or APRN reasonably believes lacks health care decision-making capacity and for whom no guardian, agent, or surrogate has been appointed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The surrogate may make health care decisions for a principal to same extent as an agent under a durable power of attorney for health care for up to 90 days after being identified in RSA 137-J:35, I, unless the principal regains health care decision-making capacity or a guardian is appointed or patient is determined to be near death, as defined in RSA 137-J:2, XVI.  The authority of the surrogate shall terminate after 90 days.
