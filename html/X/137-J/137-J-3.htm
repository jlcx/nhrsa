&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No health care provider or residential care provider, and no health care service plan, insurer issuing disability insurance, self-insured employee welfare benefit plan, or nonprofit hospital service plan shall charge a person a different rate because of the existence or non-existence of an advance directive or do not resuscitate order, or require any person to execute an advance directive or require the issuance of a do not resuscitate order as a condition of admission to a hospital, nursing home, or residential care home, or as a condition of being insured for, or receiving, health or residential care services.  Health or residential care services shall not be refused because a person is known to have executed an advance directive or have a do not resuscitate order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The execution of an advance directive pursuant to this chapter shall not affect in any manner the sale, procurement, or issuance of any policy of life insurance, nor shall it be deemed to modify the terms of an existing policy of life insurance.  No policy of life insurance shall be legally impaired, modified or invalidated in any manner by the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from an insured person notwithstanding any term of the policy to the contrary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any health care provider or residential care provider which does not recognize DNR's or living wills shall post at every place of admission, a notice which shall be a minimum size of 8  1/2" x 11" stating the following in legible print:  "This hospital/facility does not honor Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) or Living Will documents.''
