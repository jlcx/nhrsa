<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall use the money collected under RSA 147-B:12 to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Award grants to pay for the costs associated with the establishment, improvement, or operation of used oil collection centers at public facilities such as fire stations, police barracks, highway departments, county garages, solid waste facilities, or other suitable locations;  and provide technical assistance to persons who organize such programs.  Political subdivisions and other government entities shall be eligible for grants not to exceed $2,500 on an annual basis for the costs associated with the establishment or improvement of used oil collection facilities.  In addition, political subdivisions and other government entities shall be eligible for grants on an annual basis for costs associated with the off-site transportation and recycling of used oil collected from individuals disposing of used oil.  Non-profit organizations that focus on waste management and recycling issues, and private businesses that are registered state motor vehicle inspection stations, shall be eligible for grants not to exceed $2,500 on an annual basis for the costs to establish a used oil collection facility.  In providing funding under this subparagraph, priority shall be given to reimburse political subdivisions without public collection centers, followed by political subdivisions that have established collection centers, followed by other government entities, state motor vehicle inspection stations, and non-profit organizations.  Political subdivisions that use the same center may combine their awards, but in no case shall the amount awarded to a collection center exceed $5,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Develop an educational program on the proper use, handling and disposal of used oil by the public and private businesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide personnel, equipment and services to administer and enforce the provisions of this subdivision and state and federal laws relative to the proper use, handling and disposal of used oil.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner of environmental services may, within the limits of moneys appropriated, pay no more than $10,000 to dispose of all or a portion of a load of contaminated used oil possessed by a political subdivision of the state.
