&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An act of war;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An act or omission of a third party other than an employee, agent, or independent contractor of the defendant, if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, and that he took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner or former owner of property shall not be held strictly liable for the treatment or cleanup of hazardous waste or hazardous materials discovered on his property if:
