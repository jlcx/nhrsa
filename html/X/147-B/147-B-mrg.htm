&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 147-B:1 Findings and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court hereby finds that as a result of past hazardous waste dumping activities, the potential for spills of hazardous materials and the present lack of proper hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facilities within the state, the problem of managing movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste in the state has become a matter of great concern.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court hereby declares that the purpose of RSA 147-B is to provide for the proper, adequate and safe cleanup of sites within New Hampshire where hazardous wastes or materials have been improperly discharged, disposed of or spilled.  It is further the purpose of this chapter to support the regulatory and enforcement efforts associated with such cleanups, the transportation of hazardous wastes, and the proper permitting of hazardous waste facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to duplicate the functions set forth in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, Public Law 96-510.

VI. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a holder or fiduciary from any legal duty requiring a report, notification or disclosure of a release of hazardous waste or materials otherwise established under New Hampshire law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. There shall be no implied cause of action for third party damages against any person under this section to the extent that the person's liability under this section is based solely on the person's ownership of a facility.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There shall be no liability under RSA 147-B:10, I for a person otherwise liable who can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threat of release of hazardous wastes or hazardous materials, and the resulting damages were caused solely by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An act of God;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An act of war;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An act or omission of a third party other than an employee, agent, or independent contractor of the defendant, if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, and that he took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) He can prove that he had no knowledge or reason to know of the hazardous substance problem prior to his purchase of the property.  To establish that the defendant had no reason to know, as provided in this subparagraph, the defendant must have undertaken, at the time of acquisition, all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to minimize liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner or former owner of property shall not be held strictly liable for the treatment or cleanup of hazardous waste, hazardous material, oil as defined in RSA 146-A:2, III, or hazardous substance as defined in RSA 146-C:1, VII-a that are discovered on the property if:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The owner did not, in any way, cause or materially contribute to the contamination of the property;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The contamination migrated onto the property from a source that, at the time of discovery of the contamination, was located on another property.

I. The department shall have a lien upon the business revenues and all real and personal property of any person subject to liability under RSA 147-B:10, I for all costs recoverable by the state pursuant to RSA 147-B:10, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In order for the lien created under this section to be valid and effective against the real property of a person liable under RSA 147-B:10, I, the department shall record the notice of lien in the registry of deeds for each county in which such person owns or holds an interest in real property.  Upon its recording in a registry of deeds, the notice of lien shall be effective against all real property of the person located within such county.  In order for the lien created by this section to be perfected and valid against the business revenues and personal property, tangible and intangible, of the person subject to liability under RSA 147-B:10, I, the department shall record the notice of lien with the office of the secretary of state in which financing statements are filed pursuant to RSA 382-A:9-501(a)(2).  The department shall file separate notices of lien forms for each person subject to liability under RSA 147-B:10, I.  There shall be no charge for filing a notice of lien.  The fee for discharging a notice of lien shall be borne by the person identified in the notice of lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The priority of the lien created by this section shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As to the real property on which the hazardous waste or hazardous material is located, the lien shall constitute a first priority lien against such real property prior to all encumbrances, whether of record or inchoate, when the notice of lien is recorded in the registry of deeds for the county in which such real property is located and the notice of lien identifies the record owner of such real property.  This subparagraph shall not apply to real property in use as, or being constructed primarily for, residential purposes.  Such residential real property shall be governed by subparagraph (c) of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) As to the business revenues generated from the facility on which hazardous waste or hazardous material is located and personal property located at the facility on which hazardous waste or hazardous material is located, the lien shall constitute a first priority lien against such business revenues or personal property, prior to all encumbrances, whether of record or inchoate, when the notice of lien is filed with the secretary of state and the notice of lien identifies the owner of such personal property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) As to all other property, whether real, personal or business revenues, other than that which is described in subparagraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph, the notice of lien shall constitute a lien that is effective as of the date and time of recording or filing, without priority on antecedent encumbrances of record when the notice of lien is properly recorded in the appropriate registry of deeds or filed with the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Notwithstanding the lien priorities created under subparagraphs (a)-(c), a holder who, either voluntarily or in conjunction with others (including the state and federal government), undertakes clean-up activities or expends funds on other response or remedial costs, shall have a lien of equal rank and priority with the lien created by paragraph I to the extent of moneys expended for remediation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall also send a copy of the notice of lien to the person identified in the notice of lien at the address set forth in the notice of lien by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

(a) Award grants to pay for the costs associated with the establishment, improvement, or operation of used oil collection centers at public facilities such as fire stations, police barracks, highway departments, county garages, solid waste facilities, or other suitable locations;  and provide technical assistance to persons who organize such programs.
