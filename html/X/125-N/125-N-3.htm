&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall develop a dioxin emissions reduction and control program.  The program shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Studying the human health and ecological impacts of dioxin emissions and contamination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Encouraging the development of, and evaluating, technologies and pollution prevention practices, to reduce or eliminate dioxin emissions to the ambient air from stationary sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Promoting residential, commercial, and industrial energy efficiency and conservation programs to reduce or eliminate dioxin emissions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Supporting and encouraging federal legislation to reduce dioxin emissions from motor vehicles and other mobile sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Continuing pollution prevention efforts, including recycling and outreach and education efforts, to reduce or eliminate dioxin emissions to the ambient air from municipal waste combustors and medical waste incinerators.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Conducting public education and outreach regarding the public health and environmental impacts of backyard trash burning and other sources of dioxin emissions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Researching and attempting to quantify the sources of dioxin.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall not implement or impose dioxin emission limits for emissions resulting from stationary source combustion of virgin petroleum fuels, coal and untreated wood and wood products without further legislative authorization unless such limits are required to be implemented or imposed under federal authority enacted or promulgated after the effective date of this section.
