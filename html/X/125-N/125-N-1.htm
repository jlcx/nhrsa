I. The general court finds that the air pollutant dioxin is a persistent bioaccumulative toxic (PBT) compound that accumulates in the food chain, posing a significant adverse threat to New Hampshire's public health and welfare and to its natural environment, including fish and wildlife.  As a potent toxicant, dioxin can cause a number of adverse effects in humans including reproductive and developmental disorders, suppression of the immune system, and cancer.

II. The term "dioxin'' actually refers to a group of chemical compounds that share certain similar chemical structures and mode-of-action biological characteristics.  There are a total of 17 dioxin-like compounds that are members of 2 closely related families:  chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs).

III. The general court further finds that while the majority of dioxin deposited in New Hampshire originates from sources outside of the state, sources within the state also contribute to deposition of dioxin in New Hampshire and in the northeast region.
