&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Discontinuance of use of any car or vehicle used for transportation or distribution of food;
<br>
when the physical condition of the establishment, car, or vehicle is such that the health and safety of the public is endangered by unsanitary conditions.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The procedure to be followed to effectuate closure under RSA 143:5-a, I shall be as follows:
<br>

(a) Whenever an inspector of the department of health and human services finds an establishment or vehicle which is believed to be an imminent danger to the health and safety of the public, he shall immediately notify his supervisor of the situation.  Upon such notification, the supervisor shall so notify the commissioner of the department of health and human services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall determine, on the basis of the information provided:

<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Reinspection shall occur within 48 hours of the request.

<br>

IV. The department of health and human services shall use the provisions of RSA 541-A:31-36 in any adjudicative proceedings and hearings resulting from closures.
