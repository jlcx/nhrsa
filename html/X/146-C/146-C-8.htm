&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146-C:8 Prohibition Against Reusing Tanks. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Tanks which are removed and do not meet the standards for new tanks shall not be reinstalled for the purpose of oil or hazardous substance storage.  If a tank meets the standards, it may be reinstalled for oil or hazardous substance storage if after thorough cleaning and inspection, internally and externally, it is found to be structurally sound and free of pinholes, cracks, structural damage, or excessive corrosion.  Such tanks shall be reinstalled in accordance with requirements of this chapter.  A tank once used for oil or hazardous substance shall not be reused for a food product.  If a tank is to be disposed of as junk, it must be retested for oil or hazardous substance vapors, rendered vapor free if necessary, and punched with holes to make it unfit for further use.
