&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Prior to commencing construction or installation of a new facility or substantial modification of an existing facility, an owner shall submit plans and specifications to the department and obtain written approval of those plans.  Such plans shall be approved by an engineer licensed to practice in the state of New Hampshire on forms provided by the department.  Within 90 days of submission of completed plans, the department shall send the owner written notice of approval or disapproval.  Failure to send a notice shall be deemed to be approval of the plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Any person, except state and local governments, including counties, and school districts, submitting plans and specifications for a new facility shall pay to the department a fee of $100.  Such fee shall be for reviewing such plans and specifications and for making inspections during installation. The fees shall be deposited with the state treasurer as unrestricted revenues.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An owner shall not cause or allow any construction or other activity which is not in accordance with the approved plans and all terms and conditions of the department's approval of those plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An owner shall demonstrate financial responsibility pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 146-C:9, VII.  Proof of eligibility for financial assistance under RSA 146-D shall satisfy the requirement of demonstration of financial responsibility under this paragraph.
