<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person shall own or operate an underground storage facility in this state without a permit issued by the department.  The permit to operate may be revoked in accordance with RSA 541-A:30 for just cause, including, but not limited to, the operation or ownership of an underground storage facility in violation of the department's rules.  The revocation shall not take effect until the owner or operator has had an opportunity to be heard by the council, provided such request is made within 20 days of the issuance of the department's decision to revoke the permit.  Appeal of a decision revoking a permit to operate shall be governed by RSA 21-O:14.  Any appeal brought pursuant to RSA 541 shall not stay a decision by the waste management council which affirms the department's revocation of a permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall issue or deny a permit to all facilities registered under RSA 146-C:3 within 90 days of the receipt of the complete registration information.  A permit issued under this section shall be displayed on the premises of the underground storage facility at all times.
