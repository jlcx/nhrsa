<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the department determines that an approved operator training program has proven insufficient to adequately train operators as evidenced by inadequately trained operators, significant operational compliance issues, or inability to document that training has been provided, then the department shall revoke the approval of the operator training program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An operator training program may be re-approved if it is demonstrated that all operator training program defects have been corrected and if a revised curriculum and instructor's qualification is submitted to the department and meets the requirements of RSA 146-C:18.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An approved operator training program may withdraw as an approved operator training program by making such a request in writing to the department.
