&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-E:9 Trial;  Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The person or the county attorney or attorney general has the right to demand that the trial be before a jury.  A demand for a jury trial must be filed, in writing, no later than 30 days after the finding of probable cause.  If no demand is made, the trial shall be to the court.  At all adversarial proceedings under this chapter, the person subject to this chapter is entitled to the assistance of appointed counsel if the person is indigent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 60 days after the court's initial determination of probable cause, or, in cases where a jury trial has been elected, 60 days after the election of a jury trial, the court shall conduct a trial to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The trial may be continued upon the request of either party and a showing of good cause, or by the court on its own motion in the interests of justice, when the person will not be substantially prejudiced by the delay.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The person may retain experts or mental health professionals to perform an examination.  If the person wishes to be examined by a professional of the person's own choice, the examiner shall be provided reasonable access to the person, as well as to all relevant medical and mental health records and reports.  In the case of a person who is indigent, the court, upon the person's request, shall appoint experts or authorize other services pursuant to RSA 604-A:6.  If the defendant retains an expert to perform a mental health examination, the person shall also submit to an examination by an expert of the state's choosing.  If the person refuses to submit to an examination by the state's expert the court shall prohibit the person's mental health experts from testifying concerning any mental health tests, evaluations, or examinations of the person.
