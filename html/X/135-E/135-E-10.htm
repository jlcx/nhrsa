<center><h3>Section 135-E:10</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-E:10 Rules of Procedure and Evidence. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In all civil commitment proceedings for sexually violent predators under this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The rules of evidence, the doctor-patient privilege under RSA 329:26, privileged communications pursuant to RSA 330-A:32, or other similar statutes or rules shall not apply in proceedings under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may consider evidence of the person's prior conduct if such evidence is relevant to the issue of whether the person is a sexually violent predator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Reports by a member of the multidisciplinary team or reports provided on behalf of the multidisciplinary team shall be inadmissible in proceedings under this chapter unless the court finds the report's probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding the general inapplicability of the rules of evidence, hearsay evidence is not admissible unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule or unless the court finds that the hearsay evidence contains circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and the declarant is unavailable to testify at the civil commitment proceedings.  Hearsay evidence shall not be used as the sole basis for committing a person under this chapter.
