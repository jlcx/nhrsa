Within 45 days of receipt of such notice, if there is an articulable basis to believe that the person is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence, either the county attorney, attorney general, or the agency with jurisdiction may request that the multidisciplinary team assess and evaluate the person to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator.  If the county attorney, attorney general, or the agency with jurisdiction over the person to be assessed requests an assessment by the multidisciplinary team, the court shall appoint legal counsel to represent the person before any interview or personal examination of the person is conducted by the multidisciplinary team.
