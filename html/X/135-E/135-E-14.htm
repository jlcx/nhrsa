&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-E:14 Petitions for Release. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A person may file a petition for discharge at any time after commitment under this chapter without the approval of the commissioner, or his or her designee.  Notice of the petition shall be provided to the commissioner and to the county attorney or attorney general.  After reviewing the petition filed by the person the court may request the commissioner or county attorney or attorney general to respond to the petition.  The commissioner or county attorney or attorney general is not required to respond to a petition filed pursuant to this section unless ordered to do so by the court.  If the court determines that appointment of counsel may assist in an appropriate resolution of the petition, and the person is indigent, the court shall appoint counsel to represent the person.  If the court determines that the petition is without merit on its face, the court may deny the petition without a hearing.
