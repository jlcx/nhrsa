&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 135-E:11 Determination. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the person is a sexually violent predator.  If the determination is made by a jury, the verdict shall be unanimous.  If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court shall declare a mistrial.  If the court declares a mistrial, the county attorney or attorney general may refile the petition and proceed according to the provisions of this chapter.  Any retrial shall occur within 90 days after the previous trial, unless the subsequent proceeding is continued in accordance with RSA 135-E:9, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the court or jury determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, upon the expiration of the incarcerative portion of all criminal sentences and disposition of any detainers other than detainers for deportation by the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, the person shall be committed to the custody of the department of corrections for control, care, and treatment until such time as the person's mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person no longer poses a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others.  Persons who are detained or committed under this chapter shall be held at the secure psychiatric unit of the New Hampshire state prison or other appropriate facility controlled or contracted by the department of corrections if available.  An order committing a person shall be valid for up to 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The determination that a person is a sexually violent predator may be appealed.  The public defender shall be appointed to represent the person on appeal if the person is indigent.
