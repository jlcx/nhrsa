&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-O:1 Findings and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that while air quality has improved in recent years, scientific advances have demonstrated that adequate protection of public health, environmental quality, and economic well-being - the 3 cornerstones of New Hampshire's quality of life - requires additional, concerted reductions in air pollutant emissions.  The general court also finds that the state's tradition of environmental leadership - setting an example for similarly feasible air pollution reductions from upwind jurisdictions - is also well served by additional emission reductions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Recent studies and scientific evidence, documented in the New Hampshire Clean Power Strategy issued in January 2001 by the department of environmental services, indicates that significant negative human health and ecosystem impacts continue to be caused by air pollution.  The general court finds that the substantial quantities of several harmful air pollutants that continue to be emitted from existing fossil fuel burning steam electric power plants, despite recent reductions in the emission of certain air pollutants from some of these facilities, contribute to these harmful impacts and that additional emissions reductions from these sources are warranted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Specifically, the general court finds that aggressive further reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), mercury, and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) must be pursued.  These pollutants are primarily responsible for the human health and ecosystem impacts documented in the New Hampshire Clean Power Strategy issued in January 2001 by the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The general court finds that, as demonstrated by recent analyses, a high quality-of-life environment has been, and will continue to be, essential to New Hampshire's economic well-being.  The general court further finds that protecting New Hampshire's high quality-of-life environment by reducing air pollutant emissions returns substantial economic benefit to the state through avoided health care costs;  greater tourism resulting from healthier lakes and improved vistas;  more visits by fishermen, hunters, and wildlife viewers to wildlife ecosystems, and a more productive forest and agricultural sector.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For the above reasons and others, the general court finds that substantial additional reductions in emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>, NOx, mercury, and CO<sub>2</sub> must be required of New Hampshire's existing fossil fuel burning steam electric power plants.  Due to the collateral benefits and economies of scale associated with reducing multiple pollutant emissions at the same time, the general court finds that such aggressive emission reductions are both feasible and cost-effective if implemented simultaneously through a comprehensive, integrated power plant strategy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The general court also finds that the environmental benefits of air pollutant reductions can be most cost-effectively achieved if implemented in a fashion that allows for regulatory and compliance flexibility under a strictly limited overall emissions cap.  Specifically, market-based approaches, such as trading and banking of emission reductions within a cap-and-trade system, allow sources to choose the most cost-effective ways to comply with established emission reduction requirements.  This approach also provides sources with an incentive to reduce air pollutant emissions sooner and by greater amounts, promotes the development and use of innovative new emission control technologies, and specifies to the greatest extent possible performance results regarding environmental improvement rather than dictating expensive, facility-specific, command-and-control regulatory requirements.  The general court acknowledges that future federal regulations may mandate some facility-specific requirements regarding mercury reductions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The general court also finds that energy conservation results in direct reductions in air pollutant emissions.  Thus, incentives for energy conservation are an important component of an overall clean power strategy.  The general court recognizes that energy conservation expenditures made by utilities using system benefits charge funds can benefit all citizens and ratepayers.

Compliance plans shall also include a report of the mercury content analysis program results required under RSA 125-O:4, II and a report of the stack testing results for mercury emissions from Merrimack Units 1 and 2 and either Schiller Unit 4, 5, or 6 required under RSA 125-O:4, III.  An initial compliance plan shall be filed no later than one year after the effective date of this section.  Amended compliance plans shall be submitted to the department 45 days prior to the implementation of any change to the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The owner or operator of each affected source burning coal as fuel shall conduct a mercury content analysis program.  This program shall consist of monthly fuel samples and analyses for at least 12 consecutive months and the submittal of a final report to the department no later than one year after the effective date of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Stack testing for mercury emissions from Merrimack Units 1 and 2 and either Schiller Unit 4, 5, or 6 shall be completed using a department approved test method no later than one year after the effective date of this section.  The owner or operator shall submit a test protocol to the department at least 45 days prior to the commencement of stack testing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Compliance with the emission caps established under RSA 125-O:3, III may be demonstrated by making emission reductions at the affected sources, using compliance market-based approaches, or other methods acceptable to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) (1) Affected sources may use SO<sub>2</sub> allowances from federal or regional trading and banking programs and incentive programs established under this chapter to comply with the SO<sub>2</sub> emission cap established under RSA 125-O:3, III.  In addition, allowances or credits from other programs may be acceptable as determined by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Affected sources shall transfer to the department all annual allocations provided under the federal acid rain program.  Affected sources shall receive from the department SO<sub>2</sub> allowances equivalent to the cap established in RSA 125-O:3, III.  Additionally, in order to promote local reductions, for each year after the compliance date that combined SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from affected sources are below the annual average emissions for the previous 3 years, affected sources shall receive additional SO<sub>2</sub> allowances in a combined amount equal to the difference between the current year emissions and the average annual emissions for the previous 3 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Further, in order to encourage reductions in upwind emissions and thereby provide greater benefit to air quality in New Hampshire, for each 0.80 allowance purchased by an affected source under the federal acid rain program and utilized for compliance with the provisions of this chapter which originates from within the ozone transport region, the affected source shall receive an additional 0.20 allowance from the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The combined sum of all allowances received by the affected sources under subparagraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) shall not exceed 20,000 in any given year, and shall be credited to the affected sources' accounts in the year following each annual compliance period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Affected sources may use NOx allowances from federal or regional trading and banking programs, or other programs acceptable to the department, and NOx discrete emissions reductions by affected sources other than Merrimack Units 1 and 2 from state trading and banking programs, to comply with the NOx emission cap established under RSA 125-O:3, III.  NOx discrete emissions reductions may only be used to comply with that portion of the NOx emission cap established under RSA 125-O:3, III which does not apply to emissions between May 1 and September 30 of any calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Affected sources may use CO<sub>2</sub> allowances from federal or regional trading and banking programs, or other programs acceptable to the department, to comply with the CO<sub>2</sub> emission cap established under RSA 125-O:3, III.  Early reductions of CO<sub>2</sub> may be banked for future use in regional or national trading programs or to meet the emission caps established under RSA 125-O:3, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The owner or operator of each affected source shall be allowed to recover all prudent costs associated with compliance in a manner consistent with RSA 374-F, RSA 369-B, and the Agreement to Settle PSNH Restructuring, dated August 2, 1999, Revised and Conformed in Compliance with NHPUC Order No. 23,549.

<center><h3>Section 125-O:11</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-O:11 Statement of Purpose and Findings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is in the public interest to achieve significant reductions in mercury emissions at the coal-burning electric power plants in the state as soon as possible.  The requirements of this subdivision will prevent, at a minimum, 80 percent of the aggregated mercury content of the coal burned at these plants from being emitted into the air by no later than the year 2013.  To accomplish this objective, the best known commercially available technology shall be installed at Merrimack Station no later than July 1, 2013.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of environmental services has determined that the best known commercially available technology is a wet flue gas desulphurization system, hereafter "scrubber technology,'' as it best balances the procurement, installation, operation, and plant efficiency costs with the projected reductions in mercury and other pollutants from the flue gas streams of Merrimack Units 1 and 2.  Scrubber technology achieves significant emissions reduction benefits, including but not limited to, cost effective reductions in sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, small particulate matter, and improved visibility (regional haze).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. After scrubber technology is installed at Merrimack Station, and after a period of operation has reliably established a consistent level of mercury removal at or greater than 80 percent, the department will ensure through monitoring that that level of mercury removal is sustained, consistent with the proven operational capability of the system at Merrimack Station.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. To ensure that an ongoing and steadfast effort is made to implement practicable technological or operational solutions to achieve significant mercury reductions prior to the construction and operation of the scrubber technology at Merrimack Station, the owner of the affected coal-burning sources shall work to bring about such early reductions and shall be provided incentives to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The installation of scrubber technology will not only reduce mercury emissions significantly but will do so without jeopardizing electric reliability and with reasonable costs to consumers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The installation of such technology is in the public interest of the citizens of New Hampshire and the customers of the affected sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 125-O:1, VI, the purchase of mercury credits or allowances to comply with the mercury reduction requirements of this subdivision or the sale of mercury credits or allowances earned under this subdivision is not in the public interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The mercury reduction requirements set forth in this subdivision represent a careful, thoughtful balancing of cost, benefits, and technological feasibility and therefore the requirements shall be viewed as an integrated strategy of non-severable components.

<center><h3>Section 125-O:13</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-O:13 Compliance. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The owner shall install and have operational scrubber technology to control mercury emissions at Merrimack Units 1 and 2 no later than July 1, 2013.  The achievement of this requirement is contingent upon obtaining all necessary permits and approvals from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies and bodies;  however, all such regulatory agencies and bodies are encouraged to give due consideration to the general court's finding that the installation and operation of scrubber technology at Merrimack Station is in the public interest.  The owner shall make appropriate initial filings with the department and the public utilities commission, if applicable, within one year of the effective date of this section, and with any other applicable regulatory agency or body in a timely manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Total mercury emissions from the affected sources shall be at least 80 percent less on an annual basis than the baseline mercury input, as defined in RSA 125-O:12, III, beginning on July 1, 2013.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Prior to July 1, 2013, the owner shall test and implement, as practicable, mercury reduction control technologies or methods to achieve early reductions in mercury emissions below the baseline mercury emissions.  The owner shall report the results of any testing to the department and shall submit a plan for department approval before commencing implementation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the net power output (as measured in megawatts) from Merrimack Station is reduced, due to the power consumption requirements or operational inefficiencies of the installed scrubber technology, the owner may invest in capital improvements at Merrimack Station that increase its net capability, within the requirements and regulations of programs enforceable by the state or federal government, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Mercury reductions achieved through the operation of the scrubber technology greater than 80 percent shall be sustained insofar as the proven operational capability of the system, as installed, allows.  The department, in consultation with the owner, shall determine the maximum sustainable rate of mercury emissions reductions and incorporate such rate as a condition of operational permits issued by the department for Merrimack Units 1 and 2.  This requirement in no way affects the ability of the owner to earn over-compliance credits consistent with RSA 125-O:16, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The purchase of mercury emissions allowances or credits from any established emissions allowance or credit program shall not be allowed for compliance with the mercury reduction requirements of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the mercury reduction requirement of paragraph II is not achieved in any year after the July 1, 2013 implementation date, and after full operation of the scrubber technology, then the owner may utilize early emissions reduction credits or over-compliance credits, or both, to make up any shortfall, and thereby be in compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If the mercury reduction requirement of paragraph II is not achieved by the owner in any year after the July 1, 2013 implementation date despite the owner's installation and full operation of scrubber technology, consistent with good operational practice, and the owner's exhaustion of any available early emissions reduction or over-compliance credits, then the owner shall be deemed in violation of this section unless it submits a plan to the department, within 30 days of such noncompliance, and subsequently obtains approval of that plan for achieving compliance within one year from the date of such noncompliance.  The department may impose conditions for approval of such plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The owner shall report by June 30, 2007 and annually thereafter, to the legislative oversight committee on electric utility restructuring, established under RSA 374-F:5, and the chairpersons of the house science, technology and energy committee and the senate energy and economic development committee, on the progress and status of complying with the requirements of paragraphs I and III, relative to achieving early reductions in mercury emissions and also installing and operating the scrubber technology including any updated cost information.  The last report required shall be after the department has made a determination, under paragraph V, on the maximum sustainable rate of mercury emissions reductions by the scrubber technology.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-O:14 Measurement of Baseline Mercury Input and Emissions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Baseline mercury input shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No later than the first day of the second month following the effective date of this section, and continuing for 12 months thereafter, a representative monthly sample of the coal used traditionally (not to include trial or test coal blends) by each affected source shall be collected from each of the units identified in subparagraph (b) and analyzed to determine the average mercury content of the fuel for each unit expressed in pounds of mercury input per ton of coal combusted at each affected source.  The mercury content of the coal derived from these analyses for each affected source shall be multiplied by the average annual throughput of coal for the period 2003, 2004, and 2005 (average tons of coal combusted per year) for each respective affected source to yield the average pounds of mercury input per year into each affected source.  The sum of these annual input pound averages from each affected source shall equal the baseline mercury input.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Determination of the mercury content of the coal shall follow appropriate ASTM testing procedures (ASTM D3684-01).  For purposes of baseline mercury input determination, coal sampling shall occur at Merrimack Unit 1 and Unit 2, and at either Schiller Unit 4 or Unit 6, which shall serve to represent all Schiller units.  At least 4 of the samples taken from each of these units shall correspond with the stack testing done at each of these units under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Baseline mercury emissions shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A minimum of 4 stack tests shall be conducted at each of the units specified in subparagraph (b) using appropriate testing protocols, to determine a statistically valid average mercury emissions rate for each unit expressed in pounds of mercury emitted per ton of coal combusted at each affected source.  The rate for each affected source shall be multiplied by the average annual throughput of coal for the period 2003, 2004, and 2005 (average tons of coal combusted per year) for each respective affected source to yield the average pounds of mercury emitted per year from each affected source.  The sum of these annual emitted pound averages from each affected source shall equal the baseline mercury emissions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of the baseline mercury emissions determination, stack tests shall be conducted at Merrimack Unit 1 and Unit 2, and at either Schiller Unit 4 or Unit 6, which shall serve to represent all Schiller units.  If mercury emissions improvements are made or are being made during the testing period, the stack tests shall be conducted without the improvements running at the time of the tests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The owner shall provide its plans to accomplish the testing requirements under paragraphs I and II to the department for its approval.  The owner shall provide written reports to the department, for verification and approval, that include the test results and calculations used to determine:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The baseline mercury input.  The owner shall submit the report no later than 15 months following the effective date of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The baseline mercury emissions.  The owner shall submit the report no later than 18 months following the effective date of this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-O:16 Economic Performance Incentives. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The department shall issue to the owner early emissions reduction credits in the form of credits or fractions thereof for each pound of mercury or fraction thereof reduced below the baseline mercury emissions, on an annual basis, in the period prior to July 1, 2013.  Ratios of early reductions credits to pounds of mercury reduced shall be as follows:  1.5 credits per pound reduced prior to July 1, 2008;  1.25 credits per pound for reductions between July 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010;  and 1.1 credits per pound for reductions between January 1, 2011 and July 1, 2013.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Reductions shall be calculated based upon the results of stack tests conducted, measurement by continuous emission monitoring, or other methodology approved by the department to confirm emissions during the time of operation of mercury reduction technology.  Early emissions reduction credits may be banked by the owner or utilized after July 1, 2013 to meet the reduction requirement of RSA 125-O:13, II as allowed under RSA 125-O:13, VII.  Early emissions reduction credits are not sellable or transferable to non-affected sources;  however, upon the July 1, 2013 compliance date, the owner may request a one-for-one conversion of early emissions reduction credits to over-compliance credits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Should a federal rule applicable to mercury emissions at one or more of the affected sources be enacted with an implementation date prior to July 1, 2013, then early reduction credits may only be earned for emissions reductions that exceed the level required by the federal rule of the affected sources in aggregate or the baseline mercury emissions level, whichever is lower, at the same ratios listed in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Early emissions reduction credits shall not be used for compliance with the requirement of RSA 125-O:13, II prior to the installation of scrubber technology, and shall not be used as a means to delay the installation of the scrubber technology.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The department shall issue to the owner over-compliance credits in the form of credits or fractions thereof for each pound of mercury or fraction thereof reduced in excess of the emissions reduction requirement of RSA 125-O:13, II, on an annual basis, following the compliance date of July 1, 2013.  The ratios of over-compliance credits to excess pounds of mercury reduced shall be as follows:  0.5 credits per pound reduced for reductions between 80 and 85 percent;  1 credit per pound reduced for reductions between 85 and 90 percent reduction;  and 1.5 credits per pound reduced for reductions of 90 percent or greater.  Over-compliance credits may be banked for future use.  The requirements of RSA 125-O:13, V shall not alter the emissions levels at which over-compliance credits are earned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Should a federal rule applicable to mercury emissions at one or more of the affected sources be enacted, then over-compliance credits may only be earned for emissions reductions that exceed the level required by the federal rule of the affected sources in aggregate or the requirement of RSA 125-O:13, II, whichever is lower, at the same ratios listed in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At the request of the owner of an affected source, over-compliance credits may be surrendered by the owner to the department and SO2 allowances shall be transferred to the owner at a rate of 55 tons SO2 allowances for every one over-compliance credit.  Transfer shall be limited to a maximum of 20,000 total tons SO2 allowances transferred in a given year, defined as the sum of all SO2 allowances received by the affected sources under RSA 125-O:4, IV(a)(2) and IV(a)(3), and under this subparagraph.  SO2 allowances shall be credited to the affected sources' accounts in the following year in accordance with RSA 125-O:4, IV(a)(4).
