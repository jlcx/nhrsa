<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall implement an integrated, multi-pollutant strategy to reduce air emissions from affected sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The integrated, multi-pollutant strategy shall be implemented in a market-based fashion that allows trading and banking of emission reductions to comply with the overall statewide annual emission caps established under RSA 125-O:3, III.  Allowances, up to the amount of these caps, shall be allocated to each affected source based on the output of each affected source.  The department shall make publicly available all allocations prior to the effective date of such allocations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The strategy shall include implementation of the following statewide annual emissions caps:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) 7,289 tons annually applicable to total sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the affected sources;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) 3,644 tons annually applicable to total oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from the affected sources;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) [Repealed.]

<p>
[Paragraph III(d) repealed by 2012, 281:11, I, effective as provided by 2012, 281:17.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) 5,425,866 tons annually applicable to total carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the affected sources until December 31, 2008.
