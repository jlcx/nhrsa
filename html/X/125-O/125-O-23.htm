<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established an energy efficiency fund.  This nonlapsing, special fund shall be continually appropriated to the commission to be expended in accordance with this section.  The state treasurer shall invest the moneys deposited therein, as provided by law.  Income received on investments made by the state treasurer shall also be credited to the fund.  All programs supported by these funds shall be subject to audit by the commission as deemed necessary.  A portion of the fund moneys shall be used to pay for commission and department costs to administer this subdivision, including contributions for the state's share of the costs of the RGGI regional organization.  No fund moneys shall be used by the commission or the department to contract with outside consultants.  The commission shall transfer from the fund to the department such costs as may be budgeted and expended, or otherwise approved by the fiscal committee of the general court and the governor and council, for the department's cost of administering this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All amounts in excess of the threshold price of $1 for any allowance sale shall be rebated to all default service electric ratepayers in the state on a per-kilowatt-hour basis, in a timely manner to be determined by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All remaining proceeds received by the state from the sale of allowances shall be allocated by the commission as an additional source of funding to electric distribution companies for core energy efficiency programs that are funded by SBC funds.
