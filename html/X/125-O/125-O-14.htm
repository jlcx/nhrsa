&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Baseline mercury input shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No later than the first day of the second month following the effective date of this section, and continuing for 12 months thereafter, a representative monthly sample of the coal used traditionally (not to include trial or test coal blends) by each affected source shall be collected from each of the units identified in subparagraph (b) and analyzed to determine the average mercury content of the fuel for each unit expressed in pounds of mercury input per ton of coal combusted at each affected source.  The mercury content of the coal derived from these analyses for each affected source shall be multiplied by the average annual throughput of coal for the period 2003, 2004, and 2005 (average tons of coal combusted per year) for each respective affected source to yield the average pounds of mercury input per year into each affected source.  The sum of these annual input pound averages from each affected source shall equal the baseline mercury input.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Determination of the mercury content of the coal shall follow appropriate ASTM testing procedures (ASTM D3684-01).  For purposes of baseline mercury input determination, coal sampling shall occur at Merrimack Unit 1 and Unit 2, and at either Schiller Unit 4 or Unit 6, which shall serve to represent all Schiller units.  At least 4 of the samples taken from each of these units shall correspond with the stack testing done at each of these units under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Baseline mercury emissions shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A minimum of 4 stack tests shall be conducted at each of the units specified in subparagraph (b) using appropriate testing protocols, to determine a statistically valid average mercury emissions rate for each unit expressed in pounds of mercury emitted per ton of coal combusted at each affected source.  The rate for each affected source shall be multiplied by the average annual throughput of coal for the period 2003, 2004, and 2005 (average tons of coal combusted per year) for each respective affected source to yield the average pounds of mercury emitted per year from each affected source.  The sum of these annual emitted pound averages from each affected source shall equal the baseline mercury emissions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of the baseline mercury emissions determination, stack tests shall be conducted at Merrimack Unit 1 and Unit 2, and at either Schiller Unit 4 or Unit 6, which shall serve to represent all Schiller units.  If mercury emissions improvements are made or are being made during the testing period, the stack tests shall be conducted without the improvements running at the time of the tests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The owner shall provide its plans to accomplish the testing requirements under paragraphs I and II to the department for its approval.  The owner shall provide written reports to the department, for verification and approval, that include the test results and calculations used to determine:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The baseline mercury input.  The owner shall submit the report no later than 15 months following the effective date of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The baseline mercury emissions.  The owner shall submit the report no later than 18 months following the effective date of this section.
