I. If, after an order is issued under RSA 141-C:12, any commodity, conveyance, cargo or baggage is not removed to the place of quarantine or is not decontaminated or is brought near any dwelling house, facility, or housing providing services to people, or near any place of business or manufacture without the permission of the commissioner or his designee, the commissioner shall petition the superior court to review the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any person ordered to undergo isolation or quarantine leaves such place of quarantine, a place designated by the commissioner for the decontamination of commodities, conveyances, baggage and cargo under quarantine, or a place of treatment and care of persons under isolation or quarantine without the permission of the commissioner or his designee, the commissioner shall petition the superior court for review of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When an individual subject to an order for isolation or quarantine refuses to cooperate with such order, the commissioner may issue a complaint, which shall be sworn to before a justice of the peace.  Such complaint shall set forth the reasons for the order imposing isolation or quarantine and the place or facility where the individual shall be isolated or quarantined.  Upon being presented with such an order, any law enforcement officer shall take such individual into custody and transport the individual to the place or facility where the individual is to be isolated or quarantined.
