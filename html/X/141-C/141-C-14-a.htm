Any person subject to an order for submission of a specimen, or for examination, immunization, treatment, isolation, quarantine, provision of information, inspection of a building or conveyance, or any other order of the commissioner under this chapter or RSA 21-P:53, may request a hearing in the superior court to contest such order.  The commissioner shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the person both oral and written notice of the right to contest the order and the form for making the request, which form shall require no more than the person's name, address, and signature and the time and date of the signature.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Submission of the completed form to the law enforcement officer or other individual serving the order shall be considered a filing with the superior court and such officer or other individual shall promptly deliver the form to the superior court.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The superior court shall schedule a hearing and render a decision upon the request within 48 hours of the time the request was made.  If the court determines that exigencies related to protection of the health of the public preclude a hearing and decision within the 48-hour period, the hearing and decision may take place within a suitable time as determined by the court, but in no event later than 120 hours after the time the request was made.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. No examination, specimen, immunization, treatment, or other action shall be required against the will of a person who has filed a request for a hearing.  A person may be held in isolation or quarantine pending the outcome of the court hearing, but may no longer be held if the court fails to render its decision within the time period required under paragraph III.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. At the hearing the burden of proof shall be on the commissioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person poses a threat to public health, or that the information to be produced or inspection of a building or conveyance is necessary to protect against a serious threat to the public health, and the order issued by the commissioner is thereby warranted to alleviate such threat.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. All orders issued under this chapter shall be in writing and a copy shall be provided to the person subject to the order at the time it is served.  Every person who contests an order of the commissioner under this chapter shall be given a copy of the executed form contesting such order.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the medical examination, medical treatment, or immunization of a person who objects, and no criminal penalties shall be imposed as a result.  Notwithstanding this paragraph, such a person may be subject to isolation or quarantine for the minimum period necessary to protect the public health, as determined by the court in its decision following the hearing pursuant to this section.">
