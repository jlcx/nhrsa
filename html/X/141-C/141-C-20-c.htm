A child shall be exempt from immunization if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A physician licensed under RSA 329, or a physician exempted under RSA 329:21, III, certifies that immunization against a particular disease may be detrimental to the child's health.  The exemption shall exist only for the length of time, in the opinion of the physician, such immunization would be detrimental to the child.  An exemption from immunization for one disease shall not affect other required immunizations.
<br>
