&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 141-C:16 Mode of Treatment and Care. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the commissioner to restrict in any manner a person's right to select the mode of treatment of his choice, or to refuse treatment, when treatment is ordered by the commissioner under RSA 141-C:15, I, or to request any physical examination or treatment of a person who in good faith relies upon spiritual means or prayer for healing.  Such reliance or treatment or refusal of treatment shall not be considered a danger or menace to others under any provisions of this chapter;  provided, however, that there is compliance with the sanitary, isolation and quarantine laws and rules adopted under this chapter.  This section shall not be construed to prevent a parent or guardian from exercising his legal responsibilities.
