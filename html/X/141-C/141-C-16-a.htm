&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner, with the written approval of the governor, may close, direct, and compel the evacuation and decontamination of any building located within the state that is accessible to the public, such as businesses, primary and secondary schools, and universities, regardless of whether publicly or privately owned, when there is reasonable cause to believe the building may present an imminent danger to the public health.  The commissioner may also cause any material located within or on the grounds of a building to be decontaminated or destroyed when there is reasonable cause to believe that the material may present imminent danger to the public health.  Destruction of any material under this chapter shall be considered a taking of private property and shall be subject to the compensation provisions of RSA 4:46.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notice shall be made by posting notice on all means of ingress or egress of the building and, within 24 hours of posting, mailing the notice, return receipt requested, to the owner of record.  The notice shall state the reason for the action and its anticipated duration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Orders issued pursuant to this section shall be effective immediately and shall remain in effect in accordance with this section unless the superior court issues a decision directing otherwise.  Any person who is aggrieved by an order pursuant to this section may request a hearing in the superior court to contest that order.  The superior court shall schedule and hold a hearing and issue a decision within 5 working days of the court's receipt of the request for a hearing, unless a shorter period is required for review.  At the hearing, the burden of proof shall be on the commissioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the action taken is reasonably necessary to protect the health of the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Orders issued under this section shall be subject to the due process provisions of RSA 141-C:14-a.
