&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 141-C:1 Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The outbreak and spread of communicable disease cause unnecessary risks to health and life, interfere with the orderly workings of business, industry, government, and the process of education, and disrupt the day-to-day affairs of communities and citizens.  Because the control of communicable disease may be attained by personal actions, the timely intervention of medical practices, and cooperation among health care providers, federal, state, and municipal officials, and other groups and agencies, it is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that communicable diseases be prevented, and that such occurrences be identified, controlled, and, when possible, eradicated at the earliest possible time by application of appropriate public health measures and medical practices.

Any person subject to an order for submission of a specimen, or for examination, immunization, treatment, isolation, quarantine, provision of information, inspection of a building or conveyance, or any other order of the commissioner under this chapter or RSA 21-P:53, may request a hearing in the superior court to contest such order.  The commissioner shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the person both oral and written notice of the right to contest the order and the form for making the request, which form shall require no more than the person's name, address, and signature and the time and date of the signature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Submission of the completed form to the law enforcement officer or other individual serving the order shall be considered a filing with the superior court and such officer or other individual shall promptly deliver the form to the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The superior court shall schedule a hearing and render a decision upon the request within 48 hours of the time the request was made.  If the court determines that exigencies related to protection of the health of the public preclude a hearing and decision within the 48-hour period, the hearing and decision may take place within a suitable time as determined by the court, but in no event later than 120 hours after the time the request was made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No examination, specimen, immunization, treatment, or other action shall be required against the will of a person who has filed a request for a hearing.  A person may be held in isolation or quarantine pending the outcome of the court hearing, but may no longer be held if the court fails to render its decision within the time period required under paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. At the hearing the burden of proof shall be on the commissioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person poses a threat to public health, or that the information to be produced or inspection of a building or conveyance is necessary to protect against a serious threat to the public health, and the order issued by the commissioner is thereby warranted to alleviate such threat.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All orders issued under this chapter shall be in writing and a copy shall be provided to the person subject to the order at the time it is served.  Every person who contests an order of the commissioner under this chapter shall be given a copy of the executed form contesting such order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the medical examination, medical treatment, or immunization of a person who objects, and no criminal penalties shall be imposed as a result.  Notwithstanding this paragraph, such a person may be subject to isolation or quarantine for the minimum period necessary to protect the public health, as determined by the court in its decision following the hearing pursuant to this section.

The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, necessary to issue and carry out such orders for treatment and to restrict and control communicable disease through treatment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the person subject to the order cannot be removed to a health care provider or to a health care facility for treatment without danger to his life or to the citizenry, the commissioner shall impose isolation or quarantine under RSA 141-C:11 and shall arrange for treatment and care as necessary to mitigate the threat.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall assist indigent persons who are infected with tuberculosis and supply them with anti-tuberculosis drugs for treatment and preventative therapy, chest x-rays, and such physical examinations as necessary to monitor the course of treatment and therapy.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The cost of treatment and care, except treatment provided under RSA 141-C:15, III, and physical examinations under RSA 141-C:9 and RSA 141-C:18, shall be a cost to the person, or his parent or guardian, or, if such person is indigent, from such public funds available for such purposes.  Costs of physical examinations and treatment and care provided to the operator, passengers and crew of conveyances who are, or might have been, infected by means of the conveyance, shall be a cost to the owner, consignee or assignee of the conveyance.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The cost for maintenance of quarantine for commodities, conveyances, cargo and baggage, and for the decontamination of commodities, conveyances, cargos and baggage, shall be a cost to the owner, consignee or assignee of the commodity or conveyance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When an individual subject to an order for treatment by the commissioner refuses to undergo such ordered treatment, the commissioner may issue a complaint, which shall be sworn to before a justice of the peace.  Such complaint shall set forth the reasons for the order imposing treatment, the nature of the treatment to be provided, and the place or facility where the treatment shall be provided.  Upon being presented with such an order, any law enforcement officer shall take such individual into custody and transport the individual to the place or facility where the treatment is to be provided.

I. There is hereby established a nonlapsing and continually appropriated mosquito control fund to assist cities, towns, and mosquito control districts by providing funding for the purpose of offsetting the cost of mosquito control activities including, but not limited to, the purchase and application of chemical pesticides.  The purpose of the fund is to provide financial assistance, when needed, to cities, towns, and mosquito control districts engaging in mosquito control and abatement activities in response to a declared threat to the public health.  Any balance remaining in the mosquito control fund at the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 shall lapse to the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In order to be eligible to receive funding, a city, town, or mosquito control district shall have in place a comprehensive mosquito control plan approved by the commissioner.  This plan shall include at a minimum:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A list of the pesticides (active ingredient) and methods by which these pesticides will be applied to ensure that the application is done in a safe and proper manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Safeguards that will be taken to protect the health of the public, wildlife, and resources within the state including provisions for the measuring and monitoring of residual pesticides in the water and soil.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A comprehensive public awareness campaign geared toward prevention and designed to educate the public about the health risks associated with mosquitoes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Appropriate abatement measures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and with the concurrence of the governor, may determine that a threat to the public health exists that warrants expedited mosquito control and abatement activities within a city, town, or mosquito control district.  Such determination shall be based on local factors which may include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Historical and current climatic conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Historical and current mosquito population indices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Historical and current mosquito, veterinary, and human arboviral disease surveillance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An expedited approval process shall be established for the implementation of mosquito control and abatement activities, including the application of pesticides.  The commissioner of the department of agriculture, markets, and food may authorize expedited mosquito control and abatement activities pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A city, town, or mosquito control district shall be eligible to receive funds if the commissioner determines that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The city, town, or mosquito control district has a comprehensive mosquito control plan approved by the commissioner in accordance with paragraph II;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The city, town, or mosquito control district has engaged or plans to engage in mosquito control and abatement activities pursuant to paragraph III;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner, after consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has determined that mosquito control and abatement activities are appropriate to mitigate the public health threat;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A threat to public health has been determined in accordance with paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. Following a determination of eligibility under paragraph IV, the city, town, or mosquito control district shall be eligible for funding for mosquito control and abatement activities occurring during the same calendar year prior to or after a determination of a public health threat under paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A city, town, or mosquito control district's receipt of funds, as well as the amount of funding, shall be at the discretion of the commissioner.  In exercising his or her discretion, the commissioner shall consider the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The nature and degree of the declared threat to the public health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The nature and degree of the city, town, or mosquito control district's mosquito control and abatement activities in response to the declared threat to the public health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The city, town, or mosquito control district shall show cause why funding assistance from the mosquito control fund is necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Funding from the mosquito control fund shall not exceed 25 percent of the cost of mosquito control and abatement activities pursuant to the declared threat to the public health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Funding is available.
