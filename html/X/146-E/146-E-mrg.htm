<center><h3>Section 146-E:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146-E:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that discharges of fuel oil represent a potential serious health and safety problem to the citizens of New Hampshire and a threat to the quality of the groundwaters and surface waters of the state.  In addition, the cost of cleanup of fuel oil discharges is a significant economic burden for which economic assistance is otherwise not available.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish a fund to be used in addressing the costs incurred in the prevention and cleanup of fuel oil discharges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146-E:3 Fund Established;  Collection. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established a fuel oil discharge cleanup fund, which shall be administered by the oil fund disbursement board established under RSA 146-D:4.  This fund shall be used to reimburse costs incurred in the prevention and cleanup of fuel oil discharges in the waters and soils of the state, including administrative, technical, and legal support required by the oil fund disbursement board in administrating the fund, and in paying third party damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A fee of $.01 per gallon of fuel oil shall be assessed at the time of importation into this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Persons licensed under RSA 146-A:11-b, II shall be liable for payment of fuel oil fees which shall be collected and enforced in the manner described in RSA 146-D:3, III and V.  All fee revenues shall be deposited in the fuel oil discharge cleanup fund.  If the fund's balance becomes greater than $2,500,000, the assessment of fees shall be discontinued and only reestablished when the fund's balance is less than $1,500,000.  Until the fund balance reaches $2,000,000, at least 50 percent of the fees collected shall be allocated for reimbursements to on-premise-use facility owners and owners of land upon which on-premise-use facilities are located and for the administrative, technical, and legal support associated with such reimbursements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Moneys collected for the fund shall be deposited with the state treasurer to the credit of said fund and may be invested as provided by law.  Interest received on such investment shall also be credited to the fund.

II. Owners of facilities or land eligible under this chapter may apply for reimbursement of court-ordered damages to third parties for bodily injury or property damage, and for the costs of on-site and off-site cleanup of fuel oil discharges in amounts not to exceed a total of $500,000, incurred on or after October 1, 1992.
