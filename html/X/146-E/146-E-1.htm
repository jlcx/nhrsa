&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 146-E:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that discharges of fuel oil represent a potential serious health and safety problem to the citizens of New Hampshire and a threat to the quality of the groundwaters and surface waters of the state.  In addition, the cost of cleanup of fuel oil discharges is a significant economic burden for which economic assistance is otherwise not available.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish a fund to be used in addressing the costs incurred in the prevention and cleanup of fuel oil discharges.
