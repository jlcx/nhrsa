&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 125-M:3 Mercury Reduction and Control Program. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department shall develop a mercury reduction and control program.  The program shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any municipal waste combustor with a design capacity to burn 100 tons per day or more of municipal solid waste shall reduce its mercury emissions to achieve a mercury emission rate of no greater than 0.028 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen by volume on a dry basis, or at least 85 percent control efficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of establishing a mercury emission limit of 0.028 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen by volume on a dry basis for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Municipal waste combustors with a design capacity to burn less than 100 tons per day of municipal solid waste;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Hospital, medical and infectious waste incinerators.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department shall evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of establishing a mercury emission limit for coal-burning electricity generation plants.
