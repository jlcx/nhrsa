The site investigation work plan shall be in the form and shall contain all information required by the department in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to RSA 147-F:18.  The purpose of the site investigation is to gather sufficient information about the property and contamination to identify and justify a preliminary recommendation for remediation.  The participant shall submit any additional information required by the department during its evaluation of the work plan, or the participant may withdraw from the program as provided in this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. An initial program participation fee shall accompany the site investigation work plan in accordance with RSA 147-F:14, II.  Upon submittal of a site investigation work plan and payment of the initial program participation fee, a person shall be considered a program participant.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. In addition to the application and program participation fees, the program participant shall be responsible for all reasonable notice and hearing costs associated with property redevelopment under this chapter.  The program participant shall reimburse the department for such costs upon written request.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. The department shall evaluate the site investigation work plan and shall either approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the work plan.  If the department approves with conditions or disapproves, the program participant shall resubmit a revised work plan, or the participant may withdraw from the program as provided in this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. Upon completion of the site investigation, the program participant shall submit a site investigation report, or the participant may withdraw from the program as provided in this chapter.

The department may approve the site investigation report, or may require revisions to the report, additional investigation under an amended work plan, or both, before approving the report.  The participant shall conduct such additional site investigation work and make such revisions as are required by the department after the department's review of the report, or the participant may withdraw from the program as provided in this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII.
