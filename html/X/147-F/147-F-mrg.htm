&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 147-F:1 Findings and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the redevelopment of industrial, commercial, residential and other properties that have been subject to environmental contamination.  The strict liability imposed on owners and operators of contaminated property under existing environmental statutes has had the unintended result of discouraging the repurchase and reuse of some contaminated properties.  These properties, often referred to as brownfields, are therefore frequently abandoned or underused.  The general court also finds that it is appropriate to consider the risk posed by the contamination to human health and the environment in light of enforceable restrictions on the future use of the property when establishing cleanup goals for a contaminated property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of this chapter is to give incentives to parties interested in the redevelopment of contaminated properties by facilitating the remedial process and by providing comprehensive liability protection to parties who assume responsibility for property remediation without preexisting liability for cleanup or whose existing liability is premised solely upon their status as an owner under strict liability statutes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is the further intent of this chapter to expedite the voluntary cleanup of all contaminated properties by application of the remedial process and approach provided herein where the contaminated property or party conducting the remediation does not qualify for comprehensive liability protection.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An initial program participation fee shall accompany the site investigation work plan in accordance with RSA 147-F:14, II.  Upon submittal of a site investigation work plan and payment of the initial program participation fee, a person shall be considered a program participant.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(f) Recommend use restrictions on the proposed and future uses of the property where necessary to protect human health and the environment and describe in detail how such restrictions will be imposed and maintained, including an analysis of the long-term feasibility of maintaining such use restrictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Describe anticipated site stabilization measures for each phase of the remedial action, including cost estimates for achieving site stabilization if remedial work were to be stopped at the property before accomplishing all of the tasks specified in the approved remedial action plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. After evaluation and consideration of public comments, if any, the department shall approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the remedial action plan.  If the department approves with conditions or disapproves, the program participant shall submit a revised remedial action plan, or the participant may withdraw from the program as provided in this chapter.

A program participant shall obtain the approval of the department for an alternative schedule of submissions.  The department may require after-the-fact development of work plans, additional investigation, report supplementation, or resubmittal as necessary to obtain an approvable remedial action plan.
