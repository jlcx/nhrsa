&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 147-F:8 Withdrawal From the Program. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A program participant may withdraw from the program at any stage before or after approval of the remedial action plan.  To withdraw from the program, the program participant must:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) File a notice of intent to withdraw with the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Stabilize the site in accordance with a site stabilization plan approved by the department.  Site stabilization is limited to those actions necessary to ensure that work conducted at the property has not caused greater risk to human health and the environment than existed before the remedial work was commenced, and to ensure that the property will not pose an imminent hazard to human health or the environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Pay all outstanding fees accrued by the department in connection with the property's participation in the program, including fees associated with site stabilization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Withdrawal from the program as provided in this section before completion of the approved remedial action plan shall not be considered inconsistent or interference with the approved remedial action plan and will not void the covenant.
