Such tests shall include, but not be limited to, phenylketonuria, galactosemia, homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease, and hypothyroidism.  Additional disorders shall be added to the newborn screening panel based upon, but not limited to, the following considerations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The disorder is well-defined with a known incidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The disorder is associated with significant morbidity and/or mortality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The disorder can be detected with a screening test that is ethical, safe, accurate, and cost-effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Effective treatment exists for the disorder, and that early treatment, meaning before the onset of symptoms, is more effective in improving health outcomes than later treatment.
<br>

II. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner of the department of health and human services shall establish fees, pursuant to RSA 541-A, to be paid by hospitals for the tests required under paragraph I.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. The department shall ensure that the laboratory analyzing tests authorized under paragraph I destroys any samples no later than 6 months following the completion of testing.
