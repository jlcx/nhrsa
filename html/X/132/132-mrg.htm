<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The physician, hospital, nurse midwife, midwife, or other health care provider attending a newborn child shall test a newborn child for metabolic disorders.  Such tests shall include, but not be limited to, phenylketonuria, galactosemia, homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease, and hypothyroidism.  Additional disorders shall be added to the newborn screening panel based upon, but not limited to, the following considerations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The disorder is well-defined with a known incidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The disorder is associated with significant morbidity and/or mortality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The disorder can be detected with a screening test that is ethical, safe, accurate, and cost-effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Effective treatment exists for the disorder, and that early treatment, meaning before the onset of symptoms, is more effective in improving health outcomes than later treatment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner of the department of health and human services shall establish fees, pursuant to RSA 541-A, to be paid by hospitals for the tests required under paragraph I.  All such fees shall be paid into the newborn screening fund, hereby established in the state treasury.  Moneys from the newborn screening fund established under this section shall be nonlapsing and shall be continually appropriated for use by the department to cover laboratory analysis and related newborn screening program costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department of health and human services shall establish a newborn screening advisory committee which shall include a member of the oversight committee on health and human services, established in RSA 126-A:13, and representation from health care subspecialties, as determined by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. The department shall ensure that the laboratory analyzing tests authorized under paragraph I destroys any samples no later than 6 months following the completion of testing.  Any samples taken for newborn screening shall only be used for tests required under this section.  No such samples may be used for other research or DNA testing purposes unless authorized by the parent or guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall make an annual report commencing on January 1, 2006 to the oversight committee on health and human services relative to newborn screening tests which shall include, but not be limited to the number and type of tests performed and their fiscal impact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No whole-genome DNA sequencing shall be performed pursuant to this chapter unless the general court authorizes such sequencing by statute.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 132:33 Notification Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No abortion shall be performed upon an unemancipated minor or upon a female for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed pursuant to RSA 464-A because of a finding of incompetency, until at least 48 hours after written notice of the pending abortion has been delivered in the manner specified in paragraphs II and III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 132:34 Waiver of Notice. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No notice shall be required under RSA 132:33 if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The attending abortion provider certifies in the pregnant minor's medical record that a medical emergency exists and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person or persons who are entitled to notice certify in writing that they have been notified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If such a pregnant minor elects not to allow the notification of her parent or guardian or conservator, any superior court judge shall, upon petition, or motion, and after an appropriate hearing, authorize an abortion provider to perform the abortion if said judge determines that the pregnant minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion.  If said judge determines that the pregnant minor is not mature, or if the pregnant minor does not claim to be mature, the judge shall determine whether the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parent, guardian, or conservator would be in her best interests and shall authorize an abortion provider to perform the abortion without such notification if said judge concludes that the pregnant minor's best interests would be served thereby.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such a pregnant minor may participate in proceedings in the court on her own behalf, and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for her.  Any guardian ad litem appointed under this subdivision shall maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings.  The court shall, however, advise her that she has a right to court-appointed counsel, and shall, upon her request, provide her with such counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Proceedings under this section shall be held in closed court, shall be confidential and shall ensure the anonymity of the minor.  All court proceedings under this section shall be sealed.  The minor shall have the right to file her petition in the court using a pseudonym or using solely her initials.  All documents related to this petition shall be confidential and shall not be available to the public.  These proceedings shall be given such precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay so as to serve the best interest of the pregnant minor.  In no case shall the court fail to rule within 2 court business days from the time the petition is filed, except that the 2 court business day limitation may be extended at the request of the minor.  A judge of the court who conducts proceedings under this section shall make in writing specific factual findings and legal conclusions supporting the decision and shall order a record of the evidence to be maintained including the judge's own findings and conclusions.  If the court fails to rule within the 2 court business day period and an extension was not requested, then the petition shall be deemed to have been granted, and the notice requirement shall be waived.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An expedited confidential appeal shall be available, as the supreme court provides by rule, to any such pregnant minor for whom the court denies an order authorizing an abortion without notification.  The court shall make a ruling within 2 court business days from the time of the docketing of the appeal.  An order authorizing an abortion without notification shall not be subject to appeal.  No filing fees shall be required of any such pregnant minor at either the trial or the appellate level.  Access to the trial court for the purposes of such a petition or motion, and access to the appellate courts for purposes of making an appeal from denial of the same, shall be afforded such a pregnant minor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The supreme court shall make rules to ensure that procedures followed in the appeals process are handled in an expeditious manner and protect the confidentiality of the parties involved in the appeal to satisfy the requirements of the federal courts.
