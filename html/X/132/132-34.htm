(b) The person or persons who are entitled to notice certify in writing that they have been notified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If such a pregnant minor elects not to allow the notification of her parent or guardian or conservator, any superior court judge shall, upon petition, or motion, and after an appropriate hearing, authorize an abortion provider to perform the abortion if said judge determines that the pregnant minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion.  If said judge determines that the pregnant minor is not mature, or if the pregnant minor does not claim to be mature, the judge shall determine whether the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parent, guardian, or conservator would be in her best interests and shall authorize an abortion provider to perform the abortion without such notification if said judge concludes that the pregnant minor's best interests would be served thereby.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such a pregnant minor may participate in proceedings in the court on her own behalf, and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for her.

In no case shall the court fail to rule within 2 court business days from the time the petition is filed, except that the 2 court business day limitation may be extended at the request of the minor.  A judge of the court who conducts proceedings under this section shall make in writing specific factual findings and legal conclusions supporting the decision and shall order a record of the evidence to be maintained including the judge's own findings and conclusions.  If the court fails to rule within the 2 court business day period and an extension was not requested, then the petition shall be deemed to have been granted, and the notice requirement shall be waived.
