<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The vote shall specify the provisions of this section allowing for a contract with a private nongovernmental entity for the design, construction, and funding of a sewer or sewerage system or addition or modification thereto.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A municipality may rescind the adoption provided in subparagraph (c) in the manner described in this paragraph.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Sewer rentals assessed under RSA 149-I:8 and system development charges for persons benefiting from the sewer project, held in a sewer fund under RSA 149-I:10, may be used for repayment of the costs of design and construction incurred by a private nongovernmental entity pursuant to the terms of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Sewer rentals which would otherwise have been assessed to the private nongovernmental entity may be considered as sewer rentals levied, paid, and credited to the repayment under subparagraph (a).

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The contract shall provide for the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No repayment obligation in the contract shall be made from funds other than from such separately accounted for sewer rentals, fees, and other charges in the sewer fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The total of repayments under the contract shall not exceed the total costs of design and construction incurred by a private nongovernmental entity for the project.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The contract shall contain a clause stating that no municipal general funds shall be appropriated for the repayment obligations under the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The contract under this section shall not be considered complete and enforceable until the final agreement is approved by majority vote of the governing body of the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The repayment obligation pursuant to a contract under this section shall at no time be included in the net indebtedness of the municipality for the purposes of RSA 33.

The stormwater utility shall address flood and erosion control, water quality management, ecological preservation, and annual pollutant load contained in stormwater discharge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Utilities may collect reasonable fees that are directly related to the cost of providing services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Properties charged assessments shall have equal opportunity to receive proportional benefit from the utility.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In assessing fees, the stormwater utility district shall forecast the annual cost of each component in the district's stormwater management program.  This forecast shall be the basis for annual assessments distributed equally among the number of fee units within the district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A minimum assessment may be established for fee units based on single family residences.  This equivalent residential unit (ERU) can serve as the fee unit basis for all fees.  Government property and non-profit organizations shall be subject to the fee structure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Boundaries of the district are not required to coincide with municipal boundaries.

Such fund shall be allowed to accumulate from year to year, shall not be commingled with town or city tax revenues, and shall not be deemed part of the municipality's general fund accumulated surplus.  Such fund may be expended only for the purposes specified in RSA 149-I:8, or for the previous expansion or replacement of sewage lines or sewage treatment facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except when a capital reserve fund is established pursuant to paragraph III, all sewer funds shall be held in the custody of the municipal treasurer.  Estimates of anticipated sewer rental revenues and anticipated expenditures from the sewer fund shall be submitted to the governing body as set forth in RSA 32:4 if applicable, and shall be included either as part of the municipal operating budget or as a separate warrant article submitted to the local legislative body for approval.  In a town or district that has adopted the official ballot referendum form of meeting, any such separate warrant article shall include a default amount as provided in RSA 40:13, XI-a.  If the municipality has a properly-established board of sewer commissioners, then notwithstanding RSA 41:29 or RSA 48:16, the treasurer shall pay out amounts from the sewer fund only upon order of the board of sewer commissioners.  Expenditures shall be within amounts appropriated by the local legislative body.  The sewer commission shall also remit to the municipality those costs incurred by the municipality in support of sewer operations, including but not limited to financial audit, facility insurance, treasurer compensation, and office support.

III. At the option of the local governing body, or of the board of sewer commissioners if any, all or part of any surplus in the sewer fund may be placed in one or more capital reserve funds and held in the custody of the trustees of trust funds pursuant to RSA 35:7.  If such a reserve fund is created, then the governing body, or board of sewer commissioners if any, may expend such funds pursuant to RSA 35:15 without prior approval or appropriation by the local legislative body, but all such expenditures shall be reported to the municipality pursuant to RSA 149-I:25.  This section shall not be construed to prohibit the establishment of other capital reserve funds for any lawful purpose relating to municipal water systems.
