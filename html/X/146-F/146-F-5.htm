&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The motor oil discharge cleanup fund shall be available to owners of motor oil storage facilities which are in compliance with this chapter, or owners of land where compliant facilities were located.  The oil fund disbursement board may adopt rules for administering disbursements from the fund using the same rulemaking process and authorities established in RSA 146-D:5, I, including the development of additional eligibility criteria.  Owners of motor oil storage facilities or land where compliant facilities were located shall be liable to the fund for initial cleanup costs in the manner described in RSA 146-D:6, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Owners of facilities or land eligible under this chapter may apply for reimbursement of court-ordered damages to third parties for bodily injury or property damage, and for the costs of on-site and off-site cleanup of motor oil and used motor oil discharges in amounts not to exceed $500,000, incurred on or after the effective date of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The fund shall be deemed excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance for the costs of cleanup and damages to third parties.  There shall be no right of recovery against the fund for payments made under other insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Requests for reimbursement received by the oil fund disbursement board shall be reviewed in the order in which they are received.  If sufficient funds are not available the request shall be held by the board pending availability of funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Facilities which have not met the requirements of RSA 146-F:4 shall not be eligible for reimbursement until compliance with such section has been achieved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Costs of new tanks and associated piping, or repairs to existing tanks and associated piping, shall not be considered eligible costs under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The fund shall only be available for reimbursement of costs incurred for releases of motor oil or used motor oil discovered after January 1, 1995.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Upon payment from the fund for cleanup and corrective action costs or for third party liability costs pursuant to this chapter, the right of an owner to recover any payment from any third party potentially responsible for such costs shall be assumed by the board to the extent of payment made from the fund.  An owner shall not receive multiple compensation for the same injury and any such compensation shall be repaid to the fund.
