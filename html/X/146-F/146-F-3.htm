<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established a motor oil discharge cleanup fund, which shall be administered by the oil fund disbursement board established under RSA 146-D:4.  This fund shall be used to reimburse costs incurred in the cleanup of motor oil and used motor oil discharges in the waters and soils of the state, including administrative, technical, and legal support required by the oil fund disbursement board in administering the fund, and in paying third party damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A fee of $.04 per gallon of motor oil shall be assessed at the time of importation into this state.  Persons licensed under RSA 146-A:11-b, II shall be liable for payment of this additional fee which shall be collected and enforced by the department of safety in the manner described in RSA 146-A:11-b.  The oil fund disbursement board may waive all or any portion of penalties or interest for good cause.  All fee revenues shall be deposited in the motor oil discharge cleanup fund.  If the fund's balance becomes greater than $1,000,000, the assessment of fees shall be discontinued and only reestablished when the fund's balance is less than $600,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Moneys collected for the fund shall be deposited with the state treasurer to the credit of the fund and may be invested as provided by law.  Interest received on such investment shall also be credited to the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 30 days after the effective date of this paragraph, the department of environmental services shall transfer $400,000 from the oil pollution control fund to the motor oil discharge cleanup fund.  This shall be a one-time only transfer of funds for the start-up of the motor oil discharge cleanup fund.  Half of the $.04 per gallon collected for motor oil storage facilities shall be deposited in the oil pollution control fund until the $400,000 has been returned in full.
