<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. An individual shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty under state or municipal law, or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to a civil penalty or disciplinary action by a court or occupational or professional licensing entity, simply for being in the presence or vicinity of the therapeutic use of cannabis as allowed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person who makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement official of any fact or circumstance relating to the therapeutic use of cannabis to avoid arrest or prosecution shall be guilty of a violation and may be fined $500, which shall be in addition to any other penalties that may apply for making a false statement to a law enforcement officer or for the use of cannabis other than use undertaken pursuant to this chapter.

Within 5 days after such notification, the department shall issue a new registry identification card with a new random 10-digit identification number.  The fee for new registry cards shall be established in rules set by the department pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Mere possession of, or application for, a registry identification card shall not constitute probable cause or reasonable suspicion, nor shall it be used to support the search of the individual or property of the individual possessing or applying for the registry identification card.  The possession of, or application for, a registry identification card shall not preclude the existence of probable cause if probable cause exists on other grounds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. (a) The department shall create and maintain a confidential registry of each individual who has applied for and received a registry identification card as a qualifying patient or a designated caregiver in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) Except as specifically provided in this chapter, no person shall have access to any information about qualifying patients or designated caregivers in the department's confidential registry, or any information otherwise maintained by the department about providers and alternative treatment centers, except for authorized employees of the department in the course of their official duties and local and state law enforcement personnel who have detained or arrested an individual who claims to be engaged in the therapeutic use of cannabis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If a local or state law enforcement officer submits a sworn affidavit to the department affirming that he or she has probable cause to believe cannabis is possessed at a specific address, an authorized employee for the department may disclose whether the location is associated with a qualifying patient, designated caregiver, or cultivation location of an alternative treatment center.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If a local or state law enforcement officer submits a sworn affidavit to the department affirming that he or she has probable cause to believe a specific individual possesses cannabis, an authorized employee for the department may disclose whether the person is a qualifying patient or a designated caregiver, provided that the law enforcement officer provides the person's name and address or name and date of birth.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Requests by law enforcement officials under this section to the department pursuant to a sworn affidavit, search warrant, or court order, regardless of whether or not the name or address was found in the registry, shall be confidential under this chapter and exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A.  Aggregate data relative to such requests may be made public if it does not contain any identifying information regarding the specific law enforcement request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Counsel for the department may notify law enforcement officials about falsified or fraudulent information submitted to the department where counsel has made a legal determination that there is probable cause to believe the information is false or falsified.
