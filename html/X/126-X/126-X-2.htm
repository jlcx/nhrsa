<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A qualifying patient shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty under state or municipal law, or denied any right or privilege for the therapeutic use of cannabis in accordance with this chapter, if the qualifying patient possesses an amount of cannabis that does not exceed the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Two ounces of usable cannabis;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any amount of unusable cannabis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A designated caregiver shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty under state or municipal law, or denied any right or privilege for the therapeutic use of cannabis in accordance with this chapter on behalf of a qualifying patient if the designated caregiver possesses an amount of cannabis that does not exceed the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Two ounces of usable cannabis, or the total amount allowable for the number of qualifying patients for which he or she is a designated caregiver;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any amount of unusable cannabis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A designated caregiver may receive compensation for costs, not including labor, associated with assisting a qualifying patient who has designated the designated caregiver to assist him or her with the therapeutic use of cannabis.  Such compensation shall not constitute the sale of controlled substances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) A qualifying patient is presumed to be lawfully engaged in the therapeutic use of cannabis in accordance with this chapter if the qualifying patient possesses a valid registry identification card and possesses an amount of cannabis that does not exceed the amount allowed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A designated caregiver is presumed to be lawfully engaged in assisting with the therapeutic use of cannabis in accordance with this chapter if the designated caregiver possesses a valid registry identification card and possesses an amount of cannabis that does not exceed the amount allowed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The presumptions made in subparagraphs (a) and (b) may be rebutted by evidence that conduct related to cannabis was not for the purpose of treating or alleviating the qualifying patient's qualifying medical condition or symptoms or effects of the treatment associated with the qualifying medical condition, in accordance with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A valid registry identification card, or its equivalent, that is issued under the laws of another state, district, territory, commonwealth, or insular possession of the United States that allows, in the jurisdiction of issuance, a visiting qualifying patient to possess cannabis for therapeutic purposes, shall have the same force and effect as a valid registry identification card issued by the department in this state, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The visiting qualifying patient shall also produce a statement from his or her provider stating that the visiting qualifying patient has a qualifying medical condition as defined in RSA 126-X:1;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A visiting qualifying patient shall not cultivate or purchase cannabis in New Hampshire or obtain cannabis from alternative treatment centers or from a qualifying New Hampshire patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A person otherwise entitled to custody of, or visitation or parenting time with, a minor shall not be denied such a right solely for conduct allowed under this chapter, and there shall be no presumption of neglect or child endangerment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. For the purposes of medical care, including organ transplants, a qualifying patient's authorized use of cannabis in accordance with this chapter shall be considered the equivalent of the authorized use of any other medication used at the direction of a provider, and shall not constitute the use of an illicit substance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A provider shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty under state or municipal law, or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to a civil penalty or disciplinary action by the New Hampshire board of medicine or any other occupational or professional licensing entity, solely for providing written certifications, provided that nothing shall prevent a professional licensing entity from sanctioning a provider for failing to properly evaluate a patient's medical condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. An alternative treatment center shall not be subject to prosecution under state or municipal law, search, or inspection, except by the department pursuant to RSA 126-X:7, IX;  seizure;  or penalty in any manner under state or municipal law for acting pursuant to this chapter and department rules to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Acquire or purchase cannabis seeds or seedlings;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Possess, cultivate, manufacture, or transport cannabis and seedlings;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Deliver, transfer, supply, sell, or dispense cannabis and related supplies and educational materials to qualifying patients who have designated the alternative treatment center to provide for them, to designated caregivers on behalf of the qualifying patients who have designated the alternative treatment center, or to other alternative treatment centers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. An alternative treatment center agent shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty in any manner under state or municipal law, search, or denied any right or privilege for working for an alternative treatment center pursuant to this chapter and department rules to engage in any of the actions listed in paragraph IX.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Any cannabis, cannabis paraphernalia, licit property, or interest in licit property that is possessed, owned, or used in connection with the therapeutic use of cannabis as allowed under this chapter, or acts incidental to such use, shall not be seized or forfeited if the basis for the seizure or forfeiture is activity related to cannabis that is exempt from state criminal penalties under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. An individual shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty under state or municipal law, or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to a civil penalty or disciplinary action by a court or occupational or professional licensing entity, simply for being in the presence or vicinity of the therapeutic use of cannabis as allowed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. If a state or local law enforcement officer encounters an alternative treatment center or an individual who the officer knows is an alternative treatment center agent, a designated caregiver, or a qualifying patient, or who credibly asserts he or she is an alternative treatment center agent, a designated caregiver, or a qualifying patient, the law enforcement officer shall not provide any information concerning any cannabis-related activity involving the individual or entity, except pursuant to a lawfully-issued subpoena, to any law enforcement agency that does not recognize the protection of this chapter, and any prosecution of the individual or entity for a violation of this chapter shall be conducted pursuant to the laws of this state.  This paragraph shall not apply in cases where the state or local law enforcement agency has probable cause to believe the person is distributing cannabis to a person who is not allowed to possess it under this chapter.  Any seizure of cannabis by law enforcement officers for a violation of this chapter shall be limited to the amount of cannabis in excess of the quantities permitted under this chapter and any such cannabis seized shall not be returned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. A person who ceases to be a qualifying patient or designated caregiver shall have 10 days after notification by the department to dispose of cannabis in one of the following ways:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the person was a designated caregiver and the qualifying patient who designated the caregiver is still a qualifying patient, but has designated a new caregiver, the designated caregiver may transfer cannabis to the new designated caregiver;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person may notify local law enforcement and request that they dispose of the cannabis;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person may dispose of the cannabis, after mixing the cannabis with other ingredients such as soil to render it unusable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. A laboratory which conducts testing of cannabis required under rules for alternative treatment centers adopted under this chapter, and the employees thereof, shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty under state or municipal law, or search, for acting pursuant to this chapter and department rules to possess cannabis on the premises of the laboratory for the purposes of testing, and, in the case of a laboratory employee, denied any right or privilege for working for such a laboratory.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. A facility caregiver and those employees designated by the facility to assist qualifying patients, shall not be subject to arrest by state or local law enforcement, prosecution or penalty under state or municipal law, or search, for acting pursuant to this chapter and department rules to possess cannabis on the premises of the facility for the purpose of assisting a qualifying patient who is a resident or patient of the facility in the therapeutic use of the qualifying patient's cannabis.
