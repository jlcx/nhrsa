I. The general court hereby finds that acid deposition of sulfur and nitrogen containing compounds, commonly referred to as "acid rain,'' is occurring in the state of New Hampshire.  The general court further finds that acid rain poses a significant adverse threat to the state's public health and welfare and to the natural environment by degrading natural ecosystems, including fish and wildlife.  In addition, increasing evidence suggests that acid rain affects the New Hampshire economy by reducing the growth rate and productivity of the state's forest resources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court also finds that although the major emission sources of acid rain precursors are located in the midwestern United States, sources within the state of New Hampshire also contribute to acid deposition in New Hampshire and in our neighboring states of Maine and Massachusetts.  Therefore, it is incumbent upon the people of New Hampshire to take the initiative to reduce their share of the deposition to reasonable levels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The general court acknowledges that the New England governors in May of 1984 endorsed as an interim measure the implementation of a sulfur dioxide emission cap in each New England state for both the industrial and utility sectors of the economy.
