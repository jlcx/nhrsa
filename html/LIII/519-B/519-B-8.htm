<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The findings and other writings of the panel and any evidence and statements made by a party or a party's representative during a panel hearing are not admissible in court and shall not be submitted or used for any purpose in a subsequent trial and shall not be publicly disclosed, except as follows:

(2) The party who made a statement or presented evidence may agree to the submission, use, or disclosure of that statement or evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the panel findings as to both the questions under RSA 519-B:6, I(a) and (b) are unanimous and unfavorable to the defendant, the findings are admissible in any subsequent trial of the medical injury case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
