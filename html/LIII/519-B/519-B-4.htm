&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-B:4 Panel Procedures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All documents filed with the court in a medical injury action that are part of the screening process are confidential.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 20 days of the service date specified by the court on the summons, the person or persons accused shall contact the claimant's counsel and by agreement shall designate a timetable for filing all the relevant medical and provider records necessary to a determination by the panel.  If the parties are unable to agree on a timetable within 60 days of the service date specified by the court on the summons, the claimant shall notify the chairperson of the panel.  The chairperson shall then establish a timetable for the filing of all relevant records and reasonable discovery, which shall be filed at least 30 days before any hearing date.  The hearing shall be no later than 6 months from the service date specified by the court on the summons, except when the time period has been extended by the panel chairperson in accordance with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The pretrial screening may be bypassed if all parties agree upon a resolution of the claim by trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All parties to a claim may, by written agreement, submit a claim to the binding determination of the panel.  Both parties may agree to bypass the panel for any reason, or may request that certain preliminary legal affirmative defenses or issues be litigated prior to submission of the case to the panel.  The panel shall have no jurisdiction to hear or decide, absent agreement of the parties, dispositive legal affirmative defenses, other than comparative negligence.  The panel chairperson may require the parties to litigate, by motion, such dispositive legal affirmative defenses in the superior court prior to submission of the case to the panel.  Any such defense, as well as any motion relating to discovery that the panel chairperson has chosen not to rule on, may be presented, by motion, in superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be one combined hearing for all claims under this section arising out of the same set of facts.  Where a medical injury case has been filed against more than one person accused of medical injury based on the same facts, the parties may, upon agreement of all parties, require that hearings be separated.  The chairperson may, for good cause, order separate hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All requests for extensions of time under this section shall be made to the panel chairperson.  The chairperson may extend any time period for good cause, except that the chairperson may not extend any time period that would result in the hearing being held more than 11 months following the service date specified by the court on the summons unless good cause is shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a)(1) On failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with rules or any order of the chairperson, or if the plaintiff fails to attend a properly scheduled hearing, and on motion by the chairperson or any party, after notice to all parties has been given and the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the opportunity to be heard and show good cause, the chairperson may order appropriate sanctions, which may include dismissal of the case.  If any sanctions are imposed, the chairperson shall state the sanctions in writing and include the grounds for the sanctions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless the chairperson or the panel in an order for dismissal specifies otherwise, a dismissal under this subparagraph is with prejudice for purposes of proceedings before the panel.  A dismissal with prejudice is the equivalent of a finding for the defendant on all issues before the panel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) On failure of a defendant to comply with the rules or any order of the chairperson, or if a defendant fails to attend a properly scheduled hearing, and on motion by the chairperson or any party, after notice to all parties has been given and the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the opportunity to be heard and show good cause, the chairperson may order appropriate sanctions, which may include default.  If any sanctions are imposed, the chairperson shall state the sanctions in writing and include the grounds for the sanctions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless the chairperson or the panel in its order for default specifies otherwise, a default under this paragraph is the equivalent of a finding against the defendant on all issues before the panel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person aggrieved by a chairperson's ruling regarding sanctions may appeal to the superior court, which shall defer to the chairperson's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.
