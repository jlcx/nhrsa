&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-B:3 Formation and Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The chief justice of the superior court shall maintain a list of retired judges, persons with judicial experience, and other qualified persons to serve on screening panels under this chapter, from which he or she shall choose a panel chairperson under paragraph II of this section.  The chief justice of the superior court shall maintain lists of health care practitioners and attorneys with litigation experience, recommended by their respective professional organizations to serve on screening panels under this chapter.  As required by the chief justice, the professional organization of each profession shall inform the chief justice of the names of volunteers to serve on panels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Screening panel members shall meet the same qualifications required of jurors set forth in RSA 500-A:12 and shall be selected as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon the entry of a medical injury case, the clerk of the superior court in which the medical injury case is filed shall notify the chief justice of the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 14 days following the service date specified by the court on the summons, the chief justice shall choose a retired judge, a person with judicial experience, or other qualified person from the list maintained by the chief justice to serve as chairperson of the panel to screen the claim.  If at any time a chairperson chosen under this paragraph is unable or unwilling to serve, the chief justice shall appoint a replacement following the procedure in this paragraph for the initial appointment of a chairperson.  Persons other than retired judges or those with judicial experience may be appointed as chairperson based on appropriate trial experience.  If the chief justice appoints as chairperson, a person who is not a retired judge or who does not have judicial experience, each side may make one challenge to the appointment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The chief justice shall notify the clerk of the name of the person designated to serve as chairperson and shall provide the clerk with the lists of health care practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys maintained under this section.  Upon notification of the chief justice's choice of chairperson, the clerk shall notify the chairperson and the parties, and provide them with the lists of health care practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys.  The chairperson shall choose 2 or 3 additional panel members from the lists as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) One attorney.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) One health care practitioner.  If possible, the chairperson shall choose a practitioner who practices in the same specialty or profession as the person or entity accused of professional negligence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Where the claim involves more than one person accused of professional negligence the chairperson may choose a fourth panel member who is a health care practitioner.  If possible, the chairperson shall choose a practitioner or provider in the specialty or profession of a person accused.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) When agreed upon by all the parties, the list of available panel members may be enlarged in order to select a panel member who is agreed to by the parties but who is not on the chief justice's list.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The screening panel process is not intended to delay or postpone the trial of a medical injury case.  The superior court may establish a trial date at a structuring conference, or other scheduling conference, and all interim deadlines as it would in any other case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The chief justice of the superior court shall establish the compensation of the panel chairperson if he or she is not otherwise compensated by the state of New Hampshire.  Other panel members shall serve without compensation or payment of expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The clerk of the superior court in the county in which a medical injury case is filed shall, with the consent of the chief justice of the superior court, provide clerical and other assistance to the panel chairperson.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Only challenges for cause shall be allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a panel member other than the chairperson is challenged for cause, the party challenging the member shall notify the panel chairperson.  If the panel chairperson finds cause for the challenge, he or she shall replace the panel member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the chairperson is challenged for cause, the party challenging the chairperson shall notify the chief justice of the superior court.  If the chief justice finds cause for the challenge, he or she shall replace the chairperson.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The panel, through the chairperson, shall have the same subpoena power as exists for a superior court judge.  The chairperson shall have sole authority, without requiring the agreement of other panel members, to issue subpoenas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The New Hampshire superior court rules shall govern discovery conducted under this chapter.  The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve discovery issues themselves.  The chairperson shall rule on disputes regarding discovery.  Any person aggrieved by a chairperson's ruling regarding discovery may appeal to the superior court, which shall defer to the chairperson's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.
