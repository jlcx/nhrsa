&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-B:1 Findings, Purpose, and Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Availability and affordability of insurance against liability for medical injury is essential for the protection of patients as well as assuring availability of and access to essential medical and hospital care.  This chapter affirms the intent of the general court to contain the costs of the medical injury reparations system and to promote availability and affordability of insurance against liability for medical injury.  Claims for medical injury should be resolved as early and inexpensively as possible to contain system costs.  Claims that are resolved before court determination cost less to resolve than claims that must be resolved by a court.  Meritorious claims should be identified as quickly as possible, as should non-meritorious claims.  Defendants should consider paying or compromising meritorious claims and plaintiffs should consider withdrawing or compromising non-meritorious claims, as soon as the merits of the claims are known to the parties.  Presentation of claims to a medical review panel is intended to help identify both meritorious and non-meritorious claims without the delay and expense of a court trial.  It is essential to the effectiveness of the panel process that panel proceedings be confidential unless and until a matter heard by a panel proceeds to trial.  It is equally essential to the effectiveness of the panel process that a panel's unanimous findings be presented to the jury in any matter that is not resolved prior to trial.  The panel process will encourage the prompt resolution of claims, because both sides will be given an objective view of the merits.  If the panel finds that a claim has merit, the defendant will be more likely to pay the claim or negotiate a compromise that is favorable to the claimant.  If the panel finds that the claim lacks merit, the claimant is more likely to withdraw the claim or accept a nominal settlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purposes of pretrial screening panels are:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To identify claims of professional negligence which merit compensation and to encourage early resolution of those claims prior to commencement of a lawsuit;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To identify claims of professional negligence and to encourage early withdrawal or dismissal of non-meritorious claims.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-B:3 Formation and Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The chief justice of the superior court shall maintain a list of retired judges, persons with judicial experience, and other qualified persons to serve on screening panels under this chapter, from which he or she shall choose a panel chairperson under paragraph II of this section.  The chief justice of the superior court shall maintain lists of health care practitioners and attorneys with litigation experience, recommended by their respective professional organizations to serve on screening panels under this chapter.  As required by the chief justice, the professional organization of each profession shall inform the chief justice of the names of volunteers to serve on panels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Screening panel members shall meet the same qualifications required of jurors set forth in RSA 500-A:12 and shall be selected as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon the entry of a medical injury case, the clerk of the superior court in which the medical injury case is filed shall notify the chief justice of the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 14 days following the service date specified by the court on the summons, the chief justice shall choose a retired judge, a person with judicial experience, or other qualified person from the list maintained by the chief justice to serve as chairperson of the panel to screen the claim.  If at any time a chairperson chosen under this paragraph is unable or unwilling to serve, the chief justice shall appoint a replacement following the procedure in this paragraph for the initial appointment of a chairperson.  Persons other than retired judges or those with judicial experience may be appointed as chairperson based on appropriate trial experience.  If the chief justice appoints as chairperson, a person who is not a retired judge or who does not have judicial experience, each side may make one challenge to the appointment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The chief justice shall notify the clerk of the name of the person designated to serve as chairperson and shall provide the clerk with the lists of health care practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys maintained under this section.  Upon notification of the chief justice's choice of chairperson, the clerk shall notify the chairperson and the parties, and provide them with the lists of health care practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys.  The chairperson shall choose 2 or 3 additional panel members from the lists as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) One attorney.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) One health care practitioner.  If possible, the chairperson shall choose a practitioner who practices in the same specialty or profession as the person or entity accused of professional negligence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Where the claim involves more than one person accused of professional negligence the chairperson may choose a fourth panel member who is a health care practitioner.  If possible, the chairperson shall choose a practitioner or provider in the specialty or profession of a person accused.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) When agreed upon by all the parties, the list of available panel members may be enlarged in order to select a panel member who is agreed to by the parties but who is not on the chief justice's list.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The screening panel process is not intended to delay or postpone the trial of a medical injury case.  The superior court may establish a trial date at a structuring conference, or other scheduling conference, and all interim deadlines as it would in any other case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The chief justice of the superior court shall establish the compensation of the panel chairperson if he or she is not otherwise compensated by the state of New Hampshire.  Other panel members shall serve without compensation or payment of expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The clerk of the superior court in the county in which a medical injury case is filed shall, with the consent of the chief justice of the superior court, provide clerical and other assistance to the panel chairperson.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Only challenges for cause shall be allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a panel member other than the chairperson is challenged for cause, the party challenging the member shall notify the panel chairperson.  If the panel chairperson finds cause for the challenge, he or she shall replace the panel member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the chairperson is challenged for cause, the party challenging the chairperson shall notify the chief justice of the superior court.  If the chief justice finds cause for the challenge, he or she shall replace the chairperson.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The panel, through the chairperson, shall have the same subpoena power as exists for a superior court judge.  The chairperson shall have sole authority, without requiring the agreement of other panel members, to issue subpoenas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The New Hampshire superior court rules shall govern discovery conducted under this chapter.  The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve discovery issues themselves.  The chairperson shall rule on disputes regarding discovery.  Any person aggrieved by a chairperson's ruling regarding discovery may appeal to the superior court, which shall defer to the chairperson's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.

<center><h3>Section 519-B:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-B:4 Panel Procedures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All documents filed with the court in a medical injury action that are part of the screening process are confidential.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 20 days of the service date specified by the court on the summons, the person or persons accused shall contact the claimant's counsel and by agreement shall designate a timetable for filing all the relevant medical and provider records necessary to a determination by the panel.  If the parties are unable to agree on a timetable within 60 days of the service date specified by the court on the summons, the claimant shall notify the chairperson of the panel.  The chairperson shall then establish a timetable for the filing of all relevant records and reasonable discovery, which shall be filed at least 30 days before any hearing date.  The hearing shall be no later than 6 months from the service date specified by the court on the summons, except when the time period has been extended by the panel chairperson in accordance with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The pretrial screening may be bypassed if all parties agree upon a resolution of the claim by trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All parties to a claim may, by written agreement, submit a claim to the binding determination of the panel.  Both parties may agree to bypass the panel for any reason, or may request that certain preliminary legal affirmative defenses or issues be litigated prior to submission of the case to the panel.  The panel shall have no jurisdiction to hear or decide, absent agreement of the parties, dispositive legal affirmative defenses, other than comparative negligence.  The panel chairperson may require the parties to litigate, by motion, such dispositive legal affirmative defenses in the superior court prior to submission of the case to the panel.  Any such defense, as well as any motion relating to discovery that the panel chairperson has chosen not to rule on, may be presented, by motion, in superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be one combined hearing for all claims under this section arising out of the same set of facts.  Where a medical injury case has been filed against more than one person accused of medical injury based on the same facts, the parties may, upon agreement of all parties, require that hearings be separated.  The chairperson may, for good cause, order separate hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All requests for extensions of time under this section shall be made to the panel chairperson.  The chairperson may extend any time period for good cause, except that the chairperson may not extend any time period that would result in the hearing being held more than 11 months following the service date specified by the court on the summons unless good cause is shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a)(1) On failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with rules or any order of the chairperson, or if the plaintiff fails to attend a properly scheduled hearing, and on motion by the chairperson or any party, after notice to all parties has been given and the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the opportunity to be heard and show good cause, the chairperson may order appropriate sanctions, which may include dismissal of the case.  If any sanctions are imposed, the chairperson shall state the sanctions in writing and include the grounds for the sanctions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless the chairperson or the panel in an order for dismissal specifies otherwise, a dismissal under this subparagraph is with prejudice for purposes of proceedings before the panel.  A dismissal with prejudice is the equivalent of a finding for the defendant on all issues before the panel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) On failure of a defendant to comply with the rules or any order of the chairperson, or if a defendant fails to attend a properly scheduled hearing, and on motion by the chairperson or any party, after notice to all parties has been given and the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the opportunity to be heard and show good cause, the chairperson may order appropriate sanctions, which may include default.  If any sanctions are imposed, the chairperson shall state the sanctions in writing and include the grounds for the sanctions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless the chairperson or the panel in its order for default specifies otherwise, a default under this paragraph is the equivalent of a finding against the defendant on all issues before the panel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person aggrieved by a chairperson's ruling regarding sanctions may appeal to the superior court, which shall defer to the chairperson's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.
