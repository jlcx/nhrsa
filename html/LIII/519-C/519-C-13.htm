&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-C:13 Notice and Waiver of Rights. &#150;</b>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Claimants electing to pursue resolution of a medical injury under this chapter shall execute a notice and waiver of rights which contains the following wording:
<center>
<p>
WAIVER OF RIGHTS
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
By agreeing to submit a notice of injury to the medical care provider, I understand that my rights to seek legal remedies and a jury trial for my injuries guaranteed by Part I, Articles 14 and 20 of the New Hampshire Constitution may be affected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand that I have the right to consult and retain an attorney to represent me regarding this matter, and that if an early offer settlement is reached, my attorney will be paid pursuant to RSA 519-C:5, I by the health care provider, in addition to any amount that is paid for my economic loss.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If I do not have an attorney when I sign this waiver form, the medical provider will appoint a neutral advisor to assist me in the early offer process and to explain, among other things, the differences between proceeding under this chapter or as provided in RSA 507-E and RSA 519-B.  I HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THIS WAIVER AND THE NOTICE OF INJURY ANY TIME PRIOR TO MIDNIGHT OF THE FIFTH BUSINESS DAY AFTER MY FIRST MEETING WITH THE ADVISOR, WHICH MUST OCCUR NO LATER THAN 10 BUSINESS DAYS FROM MY NOTIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY OF THE NEUTRAL ADVISOR.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If after submitting a notice of injury, the medical care provider does NOT extend an early offer (RSA 519-C:1, III), I am free to pursue my legal remedies as defined in New Hampshire law without restriction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If after submitting a notice of injury, the medical care provider does extend an early offer (RSA 519-C:1, III), I may either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Accept the early offer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Request a hearing before a hearing officer to determine whether the early offer includes all of the economic loss I am entitled to under the statute, and if necessary, the hearing officer may order the medical care provider to increase the early offer to meet the requirements of the early offer law;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Reject the early offer and seek legal remedies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand that if I reject an early offer and am later awarded economic damages equal to or less than 125 percent of the amount of the early offer, I will be responsible for paying the medical care provider's reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in proceedings under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand that if an early offer is made by the medical care provider and I accept that offer, disputes regarding the early offer can be resolved only in accordance with RSA 519-C:10 by a hearing officer listed with the judicial branch office of mediation and arbitration, at my request or the request of the medical care provider.  If either party believes that the decision of the hearing officer is unlawful, that party may seek discretionary review in the New Hampshire court system;  however, there is no assurance that the courts will undertake such review.
