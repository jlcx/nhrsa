&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-C:2 Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After a medical injury, the claimant may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Pursue resolution of a claim for medical injury pursuant to this chapter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Pursue an action for medical injury as provided in RSA 507-E and RSA 519-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For as long as the claimant and medical provider are proceeding under this chapter, this section shall govern the procedure for resolving the medical injury claim at issue between the 2 parties, notwithstanding any other provision of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the claimant elects to pursue a remedy under this chapter, the claimant shall serve a notice of injury to the medical care provider alleged to be responsible for the injury and an executed notification and waiver of rights in the form set forth in RSA 519-C:13, by certified mail, return receipt requested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon the receipt by the medical care provider of a notice of injury and an executed notification and waiver of rights, the medical care provider may elect to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Extend an early offer of settlement;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Decline to extend an early offer of settlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A claimant's failure to submit a notice of injury requesting an early offer, or a provider's failure to extend an early offer, shall not be subject to review in any hearing, court, or other proceeding of any kind.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The medical care provider shall respond to the claimant's notice of injury in writing, within 90 days, setting forth the details of its early offer, or indicating that the medical care provider has decided not to extend an early offer of settlement.  The medical care provider's written response shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address provided in the claimant's notice of injury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The medical care provider may request in writing that the individual alleging a medical injury submit to an independent medical examination by a qualified and board certified physician chosen by the medical care provider and agreed to by the claimant at a time and place reasonably convenient for the claimant.  If the parties cannot agree on a physician to conduct the examination within 30 days of the request, the hearing officer shall select the physician.  The physician conducting the examination shall not be affiliated directly or indirectly in any way, with the medical care provider alleged to have caused the injury.  The cost of the examination, including reasonable travel expenses for the claimant, shall be paid by the medical care provider's professional liability insurance company.  Within 5 days of receipt, the medical provider or its insurer shall, at no cost to the claimant, provide the claimant with all reports and documents originating from the examination.  The claimant shall also be entitled to obtain a transcript and/or audio-video recording of the examination at the claimant's expense.  Any physician conducting medical examinations under this section shall be certified by the appropriate specialty board as recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties and in good standing with the New Hampshire board of medicine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If the medical care provider requests that the claimant submit to a physical examination as set forth in paragraph VII, the time allowed for a medical care provider to respond to the claimant's notice of injury shall be extended by 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the medical care provider extends an early offer, the claimant shall accept or reject the medical care provider's written offer in writing within 60 days of receipt of the offer.  If the claimant requests a hearing pursuant to RSA 519-C:10, to resolve any dispute with respect to the content of an early offer, the timeframe within which the claimant may accept or reject the early offer shall be extended until 10 days after the decision on the disputed issue is issued by the hearing officer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If the claimant accepts the medical care provider's early offer, the claimant shall notify the medical care provider in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, and thereafter, the claimant is barred from pursuing any claim for the same medical injury against any medical care provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. If the claimant rejects the medical care provider's early offer or does not accept the medical care provider's early offer within the time constraints provided by paragraph IX, the early offer shall be considered rejected.  A claimant who rejects an early offer may pursue an action for medical injury against the medical care provider pursuant to RSA 507-E and RSA 519-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. A claimant who rejects an early offer and who does not prevail in an action for medical injury against the medical care provider by being awarded at least 125 percent of the early offer amount, shall be responsible for paying the medical care provider's reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in the proceedings under this chapter.  The claimant shall certify to the court that a bond or other suitable security for payment of the medical care provider's reasonable attorney's fees and costs has been posted before the court shall consider the case.

I. Every early offer to settle a claim under this chapter shall include all of the economic loss, plus a reasonable attorney fee as set forth herein, and shall not be reduced or apportioned based on comparative fault of multiple providers.  Any medical care provider, or combination of providers alleged to have contributed to causing an injury may extend an early offer as provided in this chapter, and acceptance of that offer by the claimant shall bar any further lawsuit or other claims for compensation by the claimant against all medical care providers arising as a result of the same medical injury.  However, any medical care provider that extends an early offer to a claimant may seek contribution in a separate action against any medical care provider or other party that contributed to causing the medical injury.  The injured individual shall not be a party to any action for contribution between medical care providers;  however, the injured individual shall reasonably cooperate with the proceedings and provide such reasonable information and testimony as may be necessary to resolve the contribution claim.  The parties to the action shall pay the injured individual all reasonable costs associated with such reasonable cooperation and testimony, including travel expenses and reasonable loss of earnings or a witness fee of $100 per day, whichever is greater.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 519-C:13 Notice and Waiver of Rights. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Claimants electing to pursue resolution of a medical injury under this chapter shall execute a notice and waiver of rights which contains the following wording:
<center>
<p>
WAIVER OF RIGHTS
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
By agreeing to submit a notice of injury to the medical care provider, I understand that my rights to seek legal remedies and a jury trial for my injuries guaranteed by Part I, Articles 14 and 20 of the New Hampshire Constitution may be affected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand that I have the right to consult and retain an attorney to represent me regarding this matter, and that if an early offer settlement is reached, my attorney will be paid pursuant to RSA 519-C:5, I by the health care provider, in addition to any amount that is paid for my economic loss.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If I do not have an attorney when I sign this waiver form, the medical provider will appoint a neutral advisor to assist me in the early offer process and to explain, among other things, the differences between proceeding under this chapter or as provided in RSA 507-E and RSA 519-B.  I HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THIS WAIVER AND THE NOTICE OF INJURY ANY TIME PRIOR TO MIDNIGHT OF THE FIFTH BUSINESS DAY AFTER MY FIRST MEETING WITH THE ADVISOR, WHICH MUST OCCUR NO LATER THAN 10 BUSINESS DAYS FROM MY NOTIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY OF THE NEUTRAL ADVISOR.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If after submitting a notice of injury, the medical care provider does NOT extend an early offer (RSA 519-C:1, III), I am free to pursue my legal remedies as defined in New Hampshire law without restriction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If after submitting a notice of injury, the medical care provider does extend an early offer (RSA 519-C:1, III), I may either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Accept the early offer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Request a hearing before a hearing officer to determine whether the early offer includes all of the economic loss I am entitled to under the statute, and if necessary, the hearing officer may order the medical care provider to increase the early offer to meet the requirements of the early offer law;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Reject the early offer and seek legal remedies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand that if I reject an early offer and am later awarded economic damages equal to or less than 125 percent of the amount of the early offer, I will be responsible for paying the medical care provider's reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in proceedings under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I understand that if an early offer is made by the medical care provider and I accept that offer, disputes regarding the early offer can be resolved only in accordance with RSA 519-C:10 by a hearing officer listed with the judicial branch office of mediation and arbitration, at my request or the request of the medical care provider.  If either party believes that the decision of the hearing officer is unlawful, that party may seek discretionary review in the New Hampshire court system;  however, there is no assurance that the courts will undertake such review.

II. A properly executed waiver form by a claimant who is competent at the time the waiver is executed shall be conclusively presumed to be a sufficient, knowing, and voluntary waiver if the waiver form complies with this section.
