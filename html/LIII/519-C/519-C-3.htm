<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the claimant is not represented by legal counsel, upon receiving a notice of injury, the medical care provider shall provide a neutral advisor who is a member of the New Hampshire Bar or a retired judge, at the medical care provider's expense, to offer assistance to the claimant and medical care provider under this chapter.  Among other things, the neutral advisor shall encourage the claimant to consider retaining an attorney, and shall ensure the claimant is aware of the differences between proceeding under this chapter or as provided in RSA 507-E and RSA 519-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A claimant who was unrepresented at the time the claimant submitted the notice and waiver of rights shall have the right to withdraw the notice of injury and the notice and waiver of rights within 5 business days after the claimant's first meeting with the neutral advisor, which shall occur no later than 10 business days from claimant's notification of the identity of the neutral advisor.  In the event the claimant withdraws the notice of injury, the early offer process shall be terminated and both parties shall proceed as if the notice of injury was never filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No medical care provider or insurer shall extend an early offer prior to the expiration of 15 business days after the claimant receives notification of the appointment of the neutral advisor.
