<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an early offer is accepted, economic losses previously incurred by the claimant as a result of the medical injury and the reasonable attorney fee shall be paid by the medical care provider to the claimant within 15 days of the claimant accepting an early offer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an early offer is accepted, the medical care provider shall pay future economic losses incurred by the claimant to the claimant as such losses accrue.  If any requested payment is denied, the medical provider shall notify the claimant in writing of the denial and the basis for denial, and inform the claimant that any request for a hearing under RSA 519-C:10 regarding the denial must be made within 30 days of the date of denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Payments for medical bills arising after the early offer settlement is reached shall be made within 15 days after the medical care provider receives reasonable proof of the fact and the amount of loss sustained.  If reasonable proof is not supplied as to the entire claim, the amount supported by reasonable proof shall be paid within 15 days after such proof is received.  Any part or all of the remainder of the claim that is later supported by reasonable proof shall be paid within 15 days after such proof is received by the medical care provider.  The medical care provider shall pay any and all fees and charges incurred by the claimant resulting from failure to make timely payment of medical bills.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Payment of lost wages shall be made weekly.  At a minimum, such payments shall be adjusted annually on July 1 by a factor equal to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for Boston-Brockton-Nashua, MA-NH-ME-CT for the prior 12 months established by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Payment of any other amounts due under an early offer shall be paid within 30 days of the date that the provider receives notice and proof of the fact and amount that is due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When necessary for the medical care provider or its insurer to evaluate whether medical expenses are reasonably related to the medical injury, the medical care provider may request in writing that the claimant submit to an independent medical evaluation as provided by RSA 519-C:2, VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Interest shall accrue at the rate of 1- 1/2 percent per month on any amounts due under an early offer that are not paid as prescribed by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In lieu of periodic payments, the claimant and medical care provider may agree upon a lump sum payment for any and all potential future economic losses suffered by the claimant, provided that the lump sum agreement is reviewed and approved by a hearing officer after a hearing.
