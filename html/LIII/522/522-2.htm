<codesect>
The tests shall be made by experts qualified as examiners of blood, tissue types and/or genetic markers who shall be appointed by the court.  The experts may be called by the court as witnesses to testify to their findings and, if called, shall be subject to cross-examination by the parties.  Any party or person at whose suggestion the tests have been ordered may demand that other experts, qualified as examiners of blood, tissue types and/or genetic markers, perform independent tests under order of court, the results of which may be offered in evidence.  The number and qualifications of such experts shall be determined by the court.
