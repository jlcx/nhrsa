&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 517:13 Discovery Depositions in Criminal Cases. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided in this section or by order of the court, depositions shall be taken in the manner provided in civil actions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court in its discretion may permit either party to take the deposition of any witness, except the defendant, in any criminal case, upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that such deposition is necessary:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To preserve the testimony of any witness who is unlikely to be available for trial due to illness, absence from the jurisdiction or reluctance to cooperate;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To ensure a fair trial, avoid surprise or for other good cause shown.  In determining the necessity, the court shall consider the complexity of the issues involved, other opportunities or information available to discover the information sought by the deposition, and any other special or exceptional circumstances which may exist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In any felony case either party may take a discovery deposition of any expert witness who may be called by the other party to testify at trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting discovery depositions by agreement between the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding this section, no party in a criminal case shall take the discovery deposition of a victim or witness who has not achieved the age of 16 years at the time of the deposition.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In any criminal case, the state may move to take videotape trial testimony of any witness, including the victim, who was 16 years of age or under at the time of the alleged offense.  Any victim or other witness who was 16 years of age or under at the time of the offense may also move to take videotape trial testimony.  The court shall order videotape trial testimony if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The child will suffer emotional or mental strain if required to testify in open court;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Further delay will impair the child's ability to recall and relate the facts of the alleged offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Videotape trial testimony taken pursuant to this section shall be conducted before the judge at such a place as ordered by the court in the presence of the prosecutors, the defendant and his attorneys, and such other persons as the court allows.  Examination and cross-examination of the child shall proceed in the same manner as permitted at trial.  Such testimony shall be admissible into evidence at trial in lieu of any other testimony by the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unless otherwise ordered by the court for good cause shown, no victim or witness whose testimony is taken pursuant to this section shall be required to appear or testify at trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any witness who is 16 years of age or under shall be allowed to have his parent or any other appropriate adult, or both, present during his testimony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The supreme court shall make any rules necessary to implement the provisions of this section.
