&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In any civil action against any individual, agency or governmental entity, including the state of New Hampshire, arising out of the conduct of a law enforcement officer having the powers of a peace officer, standards of conduct embodied in policies, procedures, rules, regulations, codes of conduct, orders or other directives of a state, county or local law enforcement agency shall not be admissible to establish negligence when such standards of conduct are higher than the standard of care which would otherwise have been applicable in such action under state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All records, reports, letters, memoranda, and other documents relating to any internal investigation into the conduct of any officer, employee, or agent of any state, county, or municipal law enforcement agency having the powers of a peace officer shall not be admissible in any civil action other than in a disciplinary action between the agency and its officers, agents, or employees.  Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the admissibility of otherwise relevant records of the law enforcement agency which relate to the incident under investigation that are not generated by or part of the internal investigation.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "internal investigation'' shall include any inquiry conducted by the chief law enforcement officer within a law enforcement agency or authorized by him.
