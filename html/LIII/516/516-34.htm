&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A witness refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide information in a proceeding before, or ancillary to a district or superior court or a grand jury;  and

(b) The person presiding over the proceeding communicates on the record to the witness an order issued under paragraph II,
<br>

No testimony or other information compelled under the order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information, may be used against the witness in any criminal case or forfeiture.  However, the witness may be prosecuted or subject to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer, or in producing or failing to produce evidence in accordance with the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The testimony or other information from such individual may be necessary to the public interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
