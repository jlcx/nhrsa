<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the court in its discretion may declare a recess during the deliberations of the jury to allow the jurors to return to their homes.  Such deliberations shall be resumed as ordered by the court.  No separation for sleep or rest of the jurors during such recess shall be grounds for a mistrial in any civil or criminal case, provided that such jurors shall have been cautioned by the court not to discuss the case with any other person during such recess.
