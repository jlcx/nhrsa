If the judgment debtor shows the district or superior court any ground upon which enforcement of a judgment of any district or superior court of this state would be stayed, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign judgment for an appropriate period, upon requiring the same security for satisfaction of the judgment which is required in this state.
