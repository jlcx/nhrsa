Whenever judgment is rendered against any person in this state, the court in which the judgment is rendered shall either at the time of rendition of the judgment inquire of the defendant as to the defendant's ability to pay the judgment in full or, upon petition of the plaintiff after judgment, order the defendant to appear in court for such inquiry.

The judgment may be enforced against any property of any kind of the debtor, except such income and property as is now exempt from attachment or execution.
