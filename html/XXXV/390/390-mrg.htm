The commissioner may vary the amount of reserve required, provided, however, that the commissioner shall not increase the amount of reserves required for any bank to an amount in excess of that which is required by the Federal Reserve System of similar banks located in this state which are members of the Federal Reserve System.  No new loan or investment shall be made by such corporation when its reserve is not in accordance with the requirements of this section.  The required reserve must be maintained on a daily basis.  The method of computation and the reserve computation period for determining compliance with this section shall be established by the commissioner.  Any deficiency in the reserve established pursuant to this section may be subject to a penalty of up to $100 per day.

Any trust company or similar corporation, incorporated under the laws of this state, and any national bank duly authorized to exercise trust powers in this state while acting as a fiduciary, or as an agent or custodian for any other fiduciary, or any fiduciary acting for himself, holding securities in the capacities aforementioned, is authorized to deposit or arrange for the deposit of such securities in a central or regional depository or clearing corporation, as defined in RSA 382-A:8-102, (3).
