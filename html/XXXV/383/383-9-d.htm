The bank commissioner may, at his or her discretion, waive one 18-month examination requirement under RSA 383:9 every 6 years for institutions which have consistently been given high ratings in past examinations.  The commissioner may also substitute for an 18-month examination once every 6 years a report of a federal institution examining agency whose reports regularly include a report on New Hampshire institutions.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Waive one examination;
<br>

(b) Substitute for one examination a report of a federal bank examining agency whose reports regularly include a report on New Hampshire banks;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Perform 2 examinations as required by 383:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may, at his or her sole discretion, upon the written request of a highly-rated nondepository trust company, satisfy the examination requirement of RSA 383:9, including modifications under paragraph I, for such trust company through an off-premises examination of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An audit report satisfying the requirements of RSA 384:43, I and II if it is prepared in accordance with RSA 384:43, III(a) and (b), and a fiduciary audit conforming to applicable generally accepted auditing standards;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such other records and information of the institution as may be required by the commissioner.
