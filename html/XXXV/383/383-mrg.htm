&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The annual salary of the bank commissioner, and that of the deputy commissioner, shall be that prescribed by RSA 94:1-4.  The commissioner may appoint examiners and such assistants as may be necessary, within the limits of the appropriations therefor and the rules of the state personnel system.  The commissioner, deputy commissioner, examiners, and other assistants shall be allowed their actual traveling expenses when engaged in their official duties.  No person shall serve as examiner who would be disqualified to serve as commissioner under the limitations of RSA 383:6, except that examiners may be indebted to such corporations and associations at the time of their appointment, or thereafter, provided any such debt is incurred primarily for personal, household, or family purposes and on terms no more favorable than those afforded to other borrowers, the examiner's employment is disclosed to such corporation or association, and both the examiner and the corporation or association disclose to the commissioner that a debt has been incurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The banking department shall complete a background investigation and a criminal history records check on every selected applicant for employment in any position in the banking department prior to a final offer of employment.  The banking department may extend a conditional offer of employment to a selected applicant after completing a background investigation, with a final offer of employment subject to a successfully completed criminal history records check.  No selected applicant may be extended a conditional offer of employment unless the banking department has initiated a criminal history records check.  The banking department shall not be held liable in any lawsuit alleging that the extension of a conditional or final offer of employment to an applicant with a criminal history was in any way negligent or deficient if the banking department fulfilled the requirements of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The selected applicant for employment shall submit to the banking department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The applicant shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern and a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check, the conditional offer of employment shall remain in effect.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the banking department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where an applicant has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The banking department shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police, which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.  The department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
