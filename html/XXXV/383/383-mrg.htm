<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall charge and collect from each entity, the condition and management of which he or she is required to examine under the provisions of RSA 383:9, an examination fee, which shall be calculated as a sum equal to the product of the average daily rate of overall salary costs, including the benefits portion thereof, and expenses of all personnel employed in making examinations under the provisions of RSA 383:9, multiplied by the number of personnel days devoted to the examination of the particular entity, provided, however, that no such entity shall be charged or pay for less than one full day.  Sums collected under this section shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited, in accordance with the department's accounting unit designation, to the appropriation for the commissioner or the consumer credit administration division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If, after the close of each fiscal year, there remains any deficiency between the sums collected under paragraph I, combined with the other fees, fines, and penalties collected by the department during the fiscal year just closed, and actual department expenditures for the fiscal year just closed, the commissioner shall make an assessment of the entities as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) From banks, credit union, and trust companies.  Each state-chartered depository bank, trust company, credit union, or similar entity, except family trust companies, shall be charged and pay such proportion of said balance applicable to the entity under the department's accounting unit designation, as its total assets bear to the total assets of all entities as shown by their reports to the commissioner as of June 30 preceding such charges, except that the percent of the fiduciary assets used in the calculation of the total assets of each entity and all entities shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Fiduciary assets up to $5,000,000,000 shall be calculated at 25 percent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Fiduciary assets that are between $5,000,000,001 and $10,000,000,000, shall be calculated at 20 percent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Fiduciary assets that are between $10,000,000,001 and $15,000,000,000, shall be calculated at 15 percent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Fiduciary assets that are between $15,000,000,001 and $20,000,000,000, shall be calculated at 10 percent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Fiduciary assets that are between $20,000,000,001 and $25,000,000,000, shall be calculated at 5 percent;

(7) Fiduciary assets that are $50,000,000,001 or more, shall be calculated at one percent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) For purposes of this section, "fiduciary assets'' means those assets reported in accordance with RSA 383-A:5-511, except that the term excludes any fiduciary asset that the entity holds, manages, or administers under an agreement with a New Hampshire family trust company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) From family trust companies.  Each family trust company shall be charged and pay such proportion of said balance applicable to all banks, credit unions, and trust companies under the department's accounting unit designation, as its total assets bear to the total assets of the entities as shown by their reports to the commissioner as of June 30 preceding such charges, except that the percent of the fiduciary assets used in the calculation of the total assets of each family trust company shall be equal to 5 percent of its fiduciary assets as reported on its report to the commissioner as of June 30 of the year preceding the charges;  however, the minimum amount chargeable shall be $3,000 and the maximum amount chargeable shall be established by the commissioner by rule, but shall not exceed 5 percent of the total assessment for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) From consumer credit division entities.  Each entity subject to the supervision of the commissioner under the provisions of RSA 361-A, RSA 397-A, RSA 399-A, RSA 399-D, and RSA 399-G, shall be charged and shall pay such proportion of the balance applicable to the consumer credit administration division under the department's accounting unit designation as the gross revenue received from the total dollar volume of loans made, originated, funded, or brokered, or debt adjustment contracts entered into, or mortgage servicing fees received or money transmitted from each entity's New Hampshire business bears to the total gross revenue received from the total dollar volume of the loans made, originated, funded, or brokered, or debt adjustment contracts entered into, or mortgage servicing fees received, or money transmitted, from New Hampshire business by all entities during the preceding calendar year ending December 31, as shown by their annual reports to the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except for entities supervised under RSA 361-A, RSA 397-A, RSA 399-A, RSA 399-D and RSA 399-G where the individual regulatory chapter specifies a shorter time, payments of the charges provided for by paragraphs I and II shall be made within 60 days after the entity's receipt of the notice of the charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any excess collected in any fiscal year under the provisions of this section shall be used to reduce the sum required to be collected in the next succeeding fiscal year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 383:11-b Special Assessment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may, as liquidator and in the name of any entity being liquidated, declare and charge a special assessment to offset the cost of administering the liquidation from the group of all other entities of the same type as the entity being liquidated in the manner set forth below:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of a liquidation of a depository bank, the commissioner as liquidator may charge and collect the assessment from all other state-chartered depository banks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of a liquidation of a credit union, the commissioner as liquidator may charge and collect the assessment from all other state-chartered credit unions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the case of a liquidation of a trust company, the commissioner as liquidator may charge and collect the assessment from all other state-chartered trust companies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before declaring and charging the special assessment, the commissioner shall make reasonable efforts to exhaust the liquid or near-liquid capital and assets of the entity being liquidated, including in the case of a liquidation of a trust company, any assets that the trust company pledged under RSA 383-C:5-503.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall only declare a special assessment in an amount that he or she reasonably believes will be necessary for the administration of the liquidation, but in no event shall the commissioner assess more than $3,000,000 per liquidation of a depository bank, credit union, or trust company.  If, in connection with the liquidation of a specific entity, the commissioner determines that additional funds above that limit are needed, then he or she may only make such assessment in accordance with this section if he or she obtains prior approval from the governor and executive council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The assessed moneys shall be designated for, and shall only be used for, the administration expenses, as defined in RSA 395:30, I, of the liquidation.  Any such funds used in administration of the liquidation shall be entitled to be a priority claim as an administration cost in the liquidation estate.  Any such additional funds not used by the commissioner shall be returned to each entity which paid into the assessment on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the amount that the entities were charged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The special assessment shall be due and payable within 30 days after the commissioner declares the assessment and so notifies each entity being assessed in writing.  If any entity refuses to obey the commissioner's order to pay the special assessment, then an action may be brought by the attorney general on the commissioner's behalf in any superior court in this state.  In that action, an order, or judgment may be entered awarding:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a temporary or permanent injunction,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the assessed amount and any accumulated statutory fines to the commissioner, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the costs in bringing the action to the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In addition to all of the court's customary powers, the court may enforce any injunction issued under this paragraph by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The special assessment shall be calculated on a pro rata basis among the group of entities in the same manner as the annual assessment is calculated in accordance with RSA 383:11.  The commissioner shall use the most recent June 30 figures for calculating the pro-rata assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. To satisfy its obligation to pay any special assessment, any trust company may withdraw funds from its pledge account established under RSA 383-C:5-501.  The trust company shall replenish the amount withdrawn from that pledge account on the earlier of 18 months of the withdrawal date or the date determined by the commissioner to be in the public interest.  By petition to the commissioner for approval, and upon showing of hardship, a trust company may seek to lengthen the time of replenishment.
