<codesect>
The commissioner shall also have general supervision of any public common trust fund created by the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation.  He may examine into the condition and management of such public common trust funds when necessary in his judgment.  Whenever he shall conduct such an examination, he shall charge and collect from the public common trust fund examined, the cost of such examination computed by multiplying the average daily rate of pay of all examining personnel employed in making such examination by the number of full man days devoted to the examination, but such charges for any fiscal year shall in no event exceed  1/2 of one percent of the net income for that fiscal year of such examined fund.
