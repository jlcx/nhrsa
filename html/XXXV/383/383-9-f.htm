&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 383:9-f Other Nonbank Lenders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If a municipal business and industrial development authority, a city development office, or a not-for-profit development organization becomes a small business lender through any program which requires that it be examined by the New Hampshire banking department, the authority or organization shall not be deemed a banking institution, but the New Hampshire banking department, upon written request from the organization, shall have the authority to examine and report on such authorities or organizations with regard to their loan portfolios.  The cost of any such examination shall be paid by the authority or organization requesting the examination.  This statute does not in any way permit or require that the bank commissioner examine these nonbank, non-Small Business Administration lenders, except when specifically requested to do so, in writing, by the nonbank lender to be examined.
