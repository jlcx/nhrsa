&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 384-B:2-d Account Service Representatives. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Subject to any rules adopted by the bank commissioner pursuant to RSA 384-B:2-b, account service representatives of a bank may visit any public event and commercial location, including any business, educational, health care, retirement or governmental facility, for the purpose of opening new deposit accounts and receiving initial deposits thereon or establishing new banking relationships, if access to such public event or commercial location is available to all banks on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The bank commissioner shall have authority to terminate visits to any public event or commercial location by all banks if the commissioner finds that access is discriminatory or by any one bank if the commissioner finds that it is conducting banking business in violation of federal or state laws or regulations.  The conduct of any business at a public event or commercial locations as authorized by this section is not a "branch office'' as defined in RSA 384-B:1, III.  The bank commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 384-B:2-b, regulating the activities of account service representatives at such public events or commercial locations.
