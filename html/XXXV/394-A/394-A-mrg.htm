<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The purpose of this chapter is to eliminate the competitive advantages enjoyed by federally-chartered financial institutions over corresponding state-chartered financial institutions by granting to such state institutions those powers, rights, benefits and privileges now or hereafter exercisable by such federal institutions that the state institutions do not have or have to a lesser extent under other provisions of law.  All powers, rights, benefits and privileges conferred upon such state-chartered financial institutions by virtue of this chapter shall be in addition to and not in substitution for or limitation of any powers, rights, benefits and privileges which such state institutions may lawfully exercise pursuant to other provisions of law.  For purposes of this chapter, but not otherwise, a state-chartered financial institution shall not be deemed to have or to be authorized to exercise any power, right, benefit or privilege under other provisions of law, unless the particular power, right, benefit or privilege is at the time authorized to such institution by the statute law of this state or the rules adopted under such law by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively and not by implication.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 394-A:7 Administrative Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No power, right, benefit or privilege conferred by this chapter upon a state-chartered financial institution shall be exercised by such institution, or by any other state financial institution of the same class, unless pursuant to a rule adopted by the commissioner in accordance with RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any 3 or more state-chartered financial institutions desiring the adoption of a rule governing the exercise of any power, right, benefit or privilege conferred upon the members of their class by this chapter shall petition the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A:4 requesting such a rule.  Any such petition shall specify the power, right, benefit or privilege proposed to be exercised and shall be accompanied by copies of the federal legislation, regulations and rulings governing the exercise of such power, right, benefit or privilege by corresponding federally-chartered financial institutions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As provided in RSA 541-A:4, within 30 days of submission of a petition, the commissioner shall deny the petition in writing, stating his reasons for denial, or shall initiate rulemaking proceedings in accordance with RSA 541-A.  If the commissioner engages in rulemaking under this paragraph, he shall act in conformity with the purpose and principles of construction enunciated in RSA 394-A:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any denial of a petition for adoption of a rule pursuant to this chapter shall be based upon a finding made by the commissioner and incorporated in such denial, that the exercise of the proposed power, right, benefit or privilege by the particular class of financial institutions, in accordance with the federal legislation, regulations and rulings governing the exercise of such power, right, benefit or privilege by corresponding federally-chartered financial institutions, would not be consistent with safe and sound practice for state institutions of the class involved.  If the commissioner denies the petition, he shall promptly serve a copy of the denial upon each state financial institution which is a member of the class affected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the commissioner grants the petition and initiates rulemaking proceedings, he may adopt a rule approving the exercise of such power, right, benefit or privilege by the class of state institutions involved in accordance with the federal legislation, regulations and rulings governing such exercise by corresponding federally-chartered financial institutions.  In such case, when the rule takes effect, the state financial institutions of the affected class may exercise the specified right, power, benefit or privilege to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as apply to corresponding federally-chartered financial institutions, and shall comply with all requirements of federal legislation, regulations and rulings governing the exercise of such power, right, benefit or privilege by such corresponding federally-chartered institutions.  Where such federal legislation, regulations and rulings call for administration or supervision by a federal supervisory agency or require the issuance of a special permit by such agency, the commissioner shall provide such administration or supervision or shall decide whether such permit shall issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner may, in the alternative, adopt a rule approving the exercise of such power, right, benefit or privilege by the class of state institutions involved in accordance with the federal legislation, regulations and rulings governing such exercise by corresponding federally-chartered financial institutions, subject to such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as he may reasonably prescribe.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In any case where it may be necessary to integrate any powers, rights, benefits or privileges granted to state-chartered financial institutions by the provisions of this chapter with powers, rights, benefits or privileges which such state institutions may lawfully exercise pursuant to other provisions of law, the commissioner may, subject to the rules of construction in RSA 394-A:1 and upon compliance with the rulemaking provisions of RSA 541-A adopt rules reasonably construing, reconciling and integrating the powers, rights, benefits or privileges in question.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The validity of any order of the commissioner denying a petition for the adoption of a rule under this section may be determined in accordance with the procedure for rehearings and court review prescribed by RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Any rule adopted pursuant to this section shall become effective upon filing with the director of legislative services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Notwithstanding RSA 541-A:17, I, or any other law to the contrary, any rule adopted pursuant to this section shall continue in force and effect until amended or repealed.  The procedure for amending or repealing a rule shall be the same as that prescribed in this section for the adoption of a rule.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter to the contrary, this chapter shall not be interpreted to grant or to enlarge the power of any New Hampshire-chartered financial institution subject to this chapter to engage in the business of insurance or in any activity otherwise requiring licensing under RSA 401 or RSA 405;  provided, however, that such a state-chartered financial institution may engage in the business of insurance to the same extent that a national bank or its subsidiary is permitted to engage in such business under 12 U.S.C. section 92 subject to the following conditions:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The provisions of this section and RSA 384:16-b, II and III shall not be construed to limit the authority of any credit union to engage in the business of insurance pursuant to the provisions of RSA 394-B:52-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of this section and RSA 384:16-b, II and III shall not be construed to limit the authority of a financial institution or its subsidiary to offer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Credit life, credit accident and health, credit property insurance, and credit involuntary unemployment insurance;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Insurance purchased by such a financial institution in connection with collateral pledged as security for a loan when the debtor breaches the contractual obligation to provide that insurance;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Private mortgage insurance;
