&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No assignment of a deposit which is evidenced by a passbook or certificate of deposit shall be a valid transfer of the deposit unless the passbook or certificate of deposit is delivered to the assignee accompanied by a written assignment or order for transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No assignment of a deposit, however evidenced, shall be effective to charge the depository bank in which the deposit is maintained with a duty of payment to the assignee prior to service by the assignee on the depository bank of written notice of the assignment.  No depository bank shall be liable to an assignee of a deposit maintained in that bank for any payment of the deposit or portion thereof or dividend or interest thereon made to the depositor prior to service on the depository bank by the assignee of the written notice of the assignment;  except that the exemption from liability shall not apply in the case of a payment to a depositor, with respect to a deposit evidenced by a passbook, which is made without production of the passbook if the bylaws of the depository bank require production of the passbook as a condition to payment.
