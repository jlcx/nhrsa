A depository bank and foreign bank that is authorized to make loans may engage in the business of loan production in this state.  A loan production office is any place of business located within this state at which the bank engages solely in activities relating to loan production.  A loan production office is not a branch office.  A depository bank or foreign bank shall provide the commissioner with written notice of its intent to establish a loan production office under RSA 383-A:6-602 and may proceed to establish a loan production office after filing the notice without further action by the commissioner.
