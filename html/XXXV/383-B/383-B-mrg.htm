&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 383-B:3-301 Banking Business. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A depository bank is authorized to solicit, receive, or accept deposits;  to make loans;  to engage in a trust business in the same manner as a trust company is permitted under RSA 383-C;  and, in connection all of the foregoing, to provide services, offer products, and engage in closely related activities.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The minimum capital of a depository bank shall comply with the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The depository bank shall maintain deposit insurance in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and comply with the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System.  A depository bank may borrow funds in connection with the conduct of its banking business;  provided, however, each borrowing shall be approved by vote of the board of directors and duly recorded in its records, and any debt security of the depository bank shall be signed by at least 2 officers designated in the vote or its bylaws for that purpose.  For the purpose of securing a loan or loans, a depository bank may pledge real estate mortgages, notes, stocks, or other securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A depository bank may directly or indirectly engage in any activity permitted for a national bank or federal savings bank or their subsidiaries under federal laws, and otherwise organize, invest in or loan funds to, any entity formed to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to the financial activity authorized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as amended from time to time, and any activity that is complementary to a financial activity that is authorized by federal regulatory authorities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

A depository bank seeking to engage in any insurance activity shall give prior written notice to the insurance commissioner and shall comply with all insurance laws of the state.  The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to prevent a depository bank or subsidiary from conducting insurance activities, provided it does so in compliance with RSA 406-C.

Any such deposit of public funds in any depository bank may be evidenced by an agreement in such form and upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the depositing public authority and the bank.  The bank commissioner may, by rule, limit the aggregate amount of securities which may be pledged by such a depository bank consistent with safe and sound banking practices, based upon the adequacy of the surplus of the bank and other criteria deemed material by the commissioner.

The deposits shall be in the name of the trust or in the name of the depository bank as trustee of the trust.  Unless required by the order of a court with proper jurisdiction, no depository bank authorized to act as trustee or executor in this state shall be required to give bond to secure performance of the depository bank's duties as trustee or executor.

<center><h3>Section 383-B:4-401</h3></center>
<br><center>[RSA 383-B:4-401 effective October 1, 2015.]</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 383-B:4-401 Deposit Accounts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A depository bank doing business in this state may continue to recognize the power of an attorney-in-fact authorized in writing to make withdrawals either in whole or in part from the account of a depositor, whether a minor or adult, until it receives written notice or is on actual notice of the revocation of his or her authority.  No depository bank shall be liable for damages, penalties, or tax by reason of any payment made under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No assignment of a deposit which is evidenced by a passbook or certificate of deposit shall be a valid transfer of the deposit unless the passbook or certificate of deposit is delivered to the assignee accompanied by a written assignment or order for transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No assignment of a deposit, however evidenced, shall be effective to charge the depository bank in which the deposit is maintained with a duty of payment to the assignee prior to service by the assignee on the depository bank of written notice of the assignment.  No depository bank shall be liable to an assignee of a deposit maintained in that bank for any payment of the deposit or portion thereof or dividend or interest thereon made to the depositor prior to service on the depository bank by the assignee of the written notice of the assignment;  except that the exemption from liability shall not apply in the case of a payment to a depositor, with respect to a deposit evidenced by a passbook, which is made without production of the passbook if the bylaws of the depository bank require production of the passbook as a condition to payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) A "payable on death'' deposit account is created by a deposit in a depository bank in the name of an account holder or several joint account holders with a designation that the account is payable on death to one or more payees, or is in trust for another, and no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust is given in writing to the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any person designated as a depositor is the owner of the deposit account.  The owner retains the right during the owner's lifetime to withdraw, assign, or pledge the balance of the deposit account, in whole or in part, as though no survivor payee or beneficiary had been named, and to delete or change a survivor payee or beneficiary.  No change in the designation of the survivor payee or beneficiary is valid unless executed on a form and in the manner prescribed by the depository bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) On the death of the sole account holder or the last surviving joint account holder, any remaining balance in a payable on death account, including interest, shall vest solely in the surviving payable on death payee, or the in trust for beneficiary, or equally and severally in the then surviving payees or beneficiaries.  If no payee or beneficiary survives, the deposit account shall remain in the estate of the last surviving owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Ninety days after the death of the sole account holder or the last surviving joint account holder, the depository bank may pay the remaining balance in the deposit account to the new owner or owners or their legal representatives without further liability for the amount or amounts paid.  If no payee or beneficiary is surviving 90 days after the last surviving account holder dies, the balance of the account shall be payable to the personal representative of that account holder.  A depository bank which makes payment in accordance with this section shall, to the extent of each payment so made, be released from all claims of any of the deposit account owners, the named payees or beneficiaries, their respective legal representatives, and all others claiming through or under them.  Each payee, beneficiary or legal representative claiming under this section shall provide the identification and other information as requested by the depository bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The account holder or joint account holders of a payable on death deposit account retain the right during the holder's or holders' lifetime to withdraw, assign or pledge the balance of the deposit account, in whole or in part, as though no survivor payee or beneficiary had been named, and to delete or change a survivor payee or beneficiary.  No change in the designation of the survivor payee or beneficiary is valid unless executed on a form and in the manner prescribed by the depository bank.  Unless otherwise required in writing by all of the joint account holders at the time the deposit account is created, the withdrawal, assignment or pledge of one joint account holder shall be binding on the other joint account holders.  For purposes hereof, no payee or beneficiary shall be deemed to be an account holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The rights of a surviving payee or beneficiary to the funds in a payable on death deposit account shall not be denied, abridged or in any way affected because the rights have not been created by a writing executed in accordance with the laws of this state prescribing the requirements to effect a valid testamentary disposition of property or because of any absence of delivery or compliance with other requirements to effect a valid gift or transfer in trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The provisions of this section shall also apply to deposits maintained in this state by foreign banks.

<center><h3>Section 383-B:5-501</h3></center>
<br><center>[RSA 383-B:5-501 effective October 1, 2015.]</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 383-B:5-501 Safe Deposit Boxes. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the amount due for the rent or use of a safe deposit box has not been paid for 6 consecutive months, or if the renter thereof shall not have removed the contents thereof within 30 days from the termination of the lease therefor for any reason other than for the non-payment of rent, the depository bank shall send a written notice to the renter at his or her last known mailing address by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.  The notice shall state that the renter has 60 days from the date the letter is sent to pay the rent and/or remove all contents, or the depository bank will follow the procedure as set forth in subsection (b) below.  The letter shall set forth in detail the procedure to be followed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At the expiration of 60 days from the date of mailing the notice, if the renter of the safe deposit box failed to pay all of the amounts due for the rental to the date of payment, and/or remove the contents, all right of the person in the safe deposit box and of access to the box shall cease.  The depository bank shall be required to use only the degree of care required of a bailee for the sole benefit of the bailor notwithstanding the contract of renting requires a higher degree of care during the period of renting.  In the presence of an officer of the depository bank and a notary public who is not an officer or employee, the depository bank shall cause the safe deposit box to be opened.  The notary public shall remove the contents thereof, make a list of them, seal the contents in a package, and write on the package the name and address of the person in whose name the safe deposit box was recorded on the books of the depository bank.  In the presence of the notary public and the bank officer, the package shall be placed in one of the storage vaults of the depository bank.  The proceedings of the notary public, including the list of the contents of the safe deposit box of the contents, shall be recorded under his or her official seal and maintained in written or electronic form by the depository bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The record of the notary public shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein in all proceedings at law and in equity wherein evidence of the facts would be competent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the contents of the safe deposit box have not been claimed or redeemed by the payment of charges within 5 years after the removal of the contents, the depository bank shall, without any requirement to appraise the contents of the safe deposit box and, notwithstanding the right to inspection under RSA 471-C:19, II(c), sell the contents of the safe deposit box at public auction, public sale, or nationally recognized internet auction to the highest bidder after providing the notice to the apparent owner as required by RSA 471-C:19, V.  For all sales or auctions, the time and place of any auction or sale shall be posted conspicuously on the premises of the depository bank and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks, the last publication being no less than 10 days before the auction or sale, in a newspaper published in the place where the safe deposit box is located.  Any documents, letters or other papers of a private nature and any property or articles of no apparent value among the contents of the safe deposit box shall not be sold, but shall be retained for the 5 years from the time of the opening of the safe deposit box, and unless sooner claimed by the renter of the safe deposit box, may thereafter be destroyed without the need to provide notice to the apparent owner under RSA 471-C:19, V.  Contents of a safe deposit box offered for sale for which no purchaser exists may be destroyed by the depository bank.  United States coin or currency among the contents of any safe deposit box so opened need not be sold, but may be used by the depository bank to pay for its charges as set forth below.  U.S. Savings Bonds shall not be sold or destroyed, but instead delivered to the administrator under RSA 471-C.  If property is destroyed under this section, no action or proceeding may be maintained against the depository bank or any of its employees, officers or directors for or on account of the action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) From the proceeds of the sale, the depository bank shall deduct all its charges for rental up to the time of opening the safe deposit box, including the amount which shall have been due for rental up to the time of opening the safe deposit box, the cost of the opening thereof, and the fees of the notary public for his or her proceedings and shall pay from time to time the further charges and costs of safe keeping, selling, and destroying the contents of the safe deposit box so opened, including reasonable expenses for notices, advertising, sale, and destruction.  After deduction of costs, the depository bank shall remit the net cash proceeds to the state treasurer under RSA 471-C:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) When a safe deposit box is rented to 2 or more persons under a rental contract granting a separate right of access to either or any one of the persons or the survivor or survivors of them, the survivor or survivors of the joint renters shall have a right of access to the safe deposit box for any purpose;  and the depository bank shall be protected against all renters of the box, their heirs, assigns, executors, and administrators, in recognizing that right.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) When a safe deposit box is rented to a person, and the renter appoints a representative on the records of the depository bank by written power of attorney expressly providing that the representative shall have a continued right of access to the safe deposit box after the death of the renter, and the renter dies survived by the representative, then, notwithstanding any rule of law to the effect that a power of attorney is terminated by the death of the principal, the surviving representative shall have a right of access to the box for any purpose;  and the depository bank, its employees, officers, and directors shall be protected against the heirs, assigns, executors, and administrators of the deceased renter in recognizing that right.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The provisions of subsections (f) and (g) shall not be construed to create a joint tenancy in or otherwise establish ownership in any of the contents of a safe deposit box.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A depository bank engaged in the business of renting safe deposit boxes, which in good faith allows the department of revenue administration access to a taxpayer's safe deposit box under the department's distraint powers under RSA 80 shall be discharged, as well as its employees, officers and directors, from any obligation or liability to the taxpayer with respect to the property contained in the safe deposit box.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The provisions of this section shall also apply to safe deposit boxes maintained in this state by foreign banks.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A depositor at a mutual bank shall have an undivided inchoate interest in the net worth of the mutual bank in proportion to the amount of the person's funds in the account or accounts divided by the aggregate amount of all funds of persons on deposit in time, savings, and demand accounts at the mutual bank at the time the interest ripens into a vested estate.  The inchoate interest shall terminate upon the withdrawal of a depositor's funds in a time, savings, or demand account or accounts from the mutual bank.  The inchoate interest shall be of no force or effect unless and until a dividend is declared or liquidation proceedings are commenced under RSA 383-B:6-607.  If a bank is owned by a mutual holding company, the depositors of the bank shall have the same inchoate interest in the net worth of the mutual holding company.

(c) Depositors of a mutual savings bank or association members of a savings association shall have the right to vote to give approval to a conversion of a mutual bank or mutual holding company from mutual to stock form in a transaction involving the issuance of securities of any bank or bank holding company other than the securities of the converting mutual bank or the securities of a mutual holding company organized by the converting mutual bank in order to acquire its capital stock, as required in RSA 383-B:6-608.  Except as otherwise provided in the organizational documents of the mutual savings bank or savings association, each depositor or association member shall be entitled to cast one vote and may vote in person or by proxy.

(a) A mutual holding company organized under this article shall not be a capital stock corporation, shall not be subject to RSA 292, nor shall it be subject to RSA 293-A, except as is otherwise expressly provided in RSA 383-A with respect to banks.  The net earnings and net worth of a mutual holding company shall inure to the benefit of depositors of its subsidiary bank or subsidiary banks.  The persons shall have the same rights in the mutual holding company as depositors of a mutual bank have in the bank under RSA 383-B:6-606.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the corporate powers of a mutual holding company shall be vested solely in its corporators, who shall consist of the persons who are named as corporators in the plan of reorganization, and such additional persons as may be chosen to serve as corporators from time to time as provided in the organizational documents of the mutual holding company.  The corporators of a mutual holding company shall have the same rights and duties in the mutual holding company as the corporators of a mutual bank have in the bank under RSA 383-B:6-605.  The governance of a mutual holding company shall be vested solely in its board of directors.  The directors shall be elected by the corporators.  The board of directors of the mutual holding company shall have all powers and authorities granted under its organizational documents and applicable federal and state laws.  The board of directors shall elect officers and shall supervise management of the mutual holding company.  The directors of a mutual holding company shall have the same rights and duties in the mutual holding company as the directors of a mutual bank have in the bank under RSA 383-B:6-604.  The initial board of directors shall consist of the persons named in the plan of reorganization.  The directors shall hold office until the first annual meeting of the corporators and until their successors have been chosen and qualified.  The board of directors shall hold an organization meeting immediately following consummation of the reorganization for the adoption of organizational documents and the election of officers.  Any action by a mutual holding company which, if taken by a business corporation, would require the approval of its shareholders under the Corporation Act shall require the vote or concurrence of the corporators of the mutual holding company and in such proportion of the corporators as would be required for the approval of similar action by shareholders of a business corporation.  In the case of a savings association converting into a mutual holding company, the rights of the corporators described in this subsection shall be held instead by the association members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The general purpose of a mutual holding company shall be conducting and carrying on the business and activities of a bank holding company.  A mutual holding company shall not accept deposits.  It shall have the general powers of business corporations as set forth in the Corporation Act.  A mutual holding company may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Invest in the stocks and securities of banks or bank holding companies;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Organize a bank in any jurisdiction and directly or indirectly acquire a bank by purchase, combination, or any other manner in any jurisdiction;
<br>

(3) Combine with or acquire another mutual holding company or foreign mutual holding company;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Combine any subsidiary of the mutual holding company with and into another subsidiary thereof;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Engage either directly or indirectly in any non-banking activity authorized for a bank holding company under federal law;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Issue capital debentures for the purpose of strengthening its financial condition.  With the approval of the commissioner, the debentures shall be considered as legal investments for banks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The limitations of RSA 383-B:9-906 on the acquisition of affiliates by a bank holding company shall apply to a mutual holding company.

The commissioner shall adopt rules governing the issuance of shares of the capital stock of the subsidiary bank to any person other than the mutual holding company which are comparable to rules adopted by the commissioner governing the conversion of depository banks from mutual to stock form.  In no event shall shares of the capital stock of the subsidiary bank be held by any person other than the mutual holding company if the commissioner determines that the corporators, if any, directors, officers, and employees of the mutual holding company or of the subsidiary bank are provided with a benefit, privilege, or advantage not generally available to depositors or otherwise impairs the rights of the depositors.

Neither the commissioner nor any employee affected hereby shall be required or compelled, as a condition of continued employment or otherwise, to consent to such flexible or alternative work schedule.  The commissioner shall be entitled to establish policies that set forth the number of hours in each work day and the days of the week that constitute work days, or other conditions applicable to flexible and alternative work schedules, and any flexible or alternative work schedule agreements entered into between the commissioner and examiners shall be subject to such policies.
