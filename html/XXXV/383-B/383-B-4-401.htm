&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A depository bank doing business in this state may continue to recognize the power of an attorney-in-fact authorized in writing to make withdrawals either in whole or in part from the account of a depositor, whether a minor or adult, until it receives written notice or is on actual notice of the revocation of his or her authority.  No depository bank shall be liable for damages, penalties, or tax by reason of any payment made under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No assignment of a deposit which is evidenced by a passbook or certificate of deposit shall be a valid transfer of the deposit unless the passbook or certificate of deposit is delivered to the assignee accompanied by a written assignment or order for transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No assignment of a deposit, however evidenced, shall be effective to charge the depository bank in which the deposit is maintained with a duty of payment to the assignee prior to service by the assignee on the depository bank of written notice of the assignment.  No depository bank shall be liable to an assignee of a deposit maintained in that bank for any payment of the deposit or portion thereof or dividend or interest thereon made to the depositor prior to service on the depository bank by the assignee of the written notice of the assignment;  except that the exemption from liability shall not apply in the case of a payment to a depositor, with respect to a deposit evidenced by a passbook, which is made without production of the passbook if the bylaws of the depository bank require production of the passbook as a condition to payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) A "payable on death'' deposit account is created by a deposit in a depository bank in the name of an account holder or several joint account holders with a designation that the account is payable on death to one or more payees, or is in trust for another, and no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust is given in writing to the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any person designated as a depositor is the owner of the deposit account.  The owner retains the right during the owner's lifetime to withdraw, assign, or pledge the balance of the deposit account, in whole or in part, as though no survivor payee or beneficiary had been named, and to delete or change a survivor payee or beneficiary.  No change in the designation of the survivor payee or beneficiary is valid unless executed on a form and in the manner prescribed by the depository bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) On the death of the sole account holder or the last surviving joint account holder, any remaining balance in a payable on death account, including interest, shall vest solely in the surviving payable on death payee, or the in trust for beneficiary, or equally and severally in the then surviving payees or beneficiaries.  If no payee or beneficiary survives, the deposit account shall remain in the estate of the last surviving owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Ninety days after the death of the sole account holder or the last surviving joint account holder, the depository bank may pay the remaining balance in the deposit account to the new owner or owners or their legal representatives without further liability for the amount or amounts paid.  If no payee or beneficiary is surviving 90 days after the last surviving account holder dies, the balance of the account shall be payable to the personal representative of that account holder.  A depository bank which makes payment in accordance with this section shall, to the extent of each payment so made, be released from all claims of any of the deposit account owners, the named payees or beneficiaries, their respective legal representatives, and all others claiming through or under them.  Each payee, beneficiary or legal representative claiming under this section shall provide the identification and other information as requested by the depository bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The account holder or joint account holders of a payable on death deposit account retain the right during the holder's or holders' lifetime to withdraw, assign or pledge the balance of the deposit account, in whole or in part, as though no survivor payee or beneficiary had been named, and to delete or change a survivor payee or beneficiary.  No change in the designation of the survivor payee or beneficiary is valid unless executed on a form and in the manner prescribed by the depository bank.  Unless otherwise required in writing by all of the joint account holders at the time the deposit account is created, the withdrawal, assignment or pledge of one joint account holder shall be binding on the other joint account holders.  For purposes hereof, no payee or beneficiary shall be deemed to be an account holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The rights of a surviving payee or beneficiary to the funds in a payable on death deposit account shall not be denied, abridged or in any way affected because the rights have not been created by a writing executed in accordance with the laws of this state prescribing the requirements to effect a valid testamentary disposition of property or because of any absence of delivery or compliance with other requirements to effect a valid gift or transfer in trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The provisions of this section shall also apply to deposits maintained in this state by foreign banks.
