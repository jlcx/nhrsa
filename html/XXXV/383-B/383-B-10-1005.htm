<codesect>
(a) The commissioner may examine New Hampshire branch offices of (i) foreign banks, other than national banks and federal savings banks, and (ii) foreign bank holding companies.  The commissioner may, as an adjunct to such authority, enter into agreements with federal and other state regulatory authorities to examine or participate in the examination of New Hampshire branch offices of foreign banks and foreign bank holding companies.  Notwithstanding RSA 98-B:5, or any other provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner is authorized to permit one or more department employees to travel outside this state for purposes of conducting or participating in the examination of a foreign bank or foreign bank holding companies without the necessity of obtaining the separate consent of the governor and executive council for such out-of-state travel.  The commissioner is further authorized to enter into agreements with federal and other state regulatory authorities for purposes of sharing and protecting the confidentiality of any department examination report, work papers, or other examination information and the examination report, work papers, or other examination information of the other state or federal regulatory authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The cost of any examination conducted under subsection (a) shall be the same as that provided by RSA 383:11, I, except that the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel employed in making examinations under the provisions of subsection (a) shall be chargeable to the foreign bank or foreign bank holding company examined and shall be paid by such entity in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner and examination personnel making an examination, either individually or as a group, may mutually agree to flexible or alternative work schedules, similar to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve Bank examiner work schedules, that will permit department examiners assigned to an out-of-state examination to work less than 5 days per calendar week, provided that the examiner shall work no less than 75 hours per scheduled pay period.  Neither the commissioner nor any employee affected hereby shall be required or compelled, as a condition of continued employment or otherwise, to consent to such flexible or alternative work schedule.  The commissioner shall be entitled to establish policies that set forth the number of hours in each work day and the days of the week that constitute work days, or other conditions applicable to flexible and alternative work schedules, and any flexible or alternative work schedule agreements entered into between the commissioner and examiners shall be subject to such policies.
