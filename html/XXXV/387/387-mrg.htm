Notwithstanding the foregoing a bank having deposits of $1,500,000 or less may invest, in loans authorized by RSA 387:4, I, an amount to any one borrower not exceeding 2  1/2 percent of deposits or 15 percent of capital funds, whichever is greater, but in no case in excess of $22,500, unless in such case 15 percent of capital funds exceeds said latter sum, in which case the limit shall be 15 percent of capital funds for such bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Obligations as endorser or guarantor of notes which carry a full recourse endorsement or unconditional guarantee by the individual, partnership or corporation transferring the same shall be subject to the limits established by paragraph I;  provided, however, that, if the bank's files or the knowledge of its officers of the financial condition of each maker of such notes is reasonably adequate, and upon certification by an officer or employee of the bank designated for that purpose by the board of trustees or directors of the bank that the responsibility of each maker of such notes has been evaluated and that the bank is relying primarily upon each such maker for the payment of such notes, the limitations of paragraph I as to the obligations of each such maker shall be the applicable loan limitation.  Such certification of such responsibility evaluation reliance for payment shall be in writing and shall be retained as part of the records of such bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Not exceeding 10 percent of deposits shall be invested in each of the following types of security:  (1) Bonds of the Dominion of Canada, its provinces and cities, and (2) Real estate mortgage loans authorized by RSA 387:4, I if the amount of the loan exceeds 80 percent of the value of the real estate by which it is secured.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Whenever in the opinion of the commissioner the condition of any bank is such that the commissioner deems it unwise for it to invest in any preferred or common stocks, including shares of investment trusts, he may by written order forbid such bank to make such investment, and said bank shall not thereafter make such investment until such order shall be revoked in writing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. In determining whether an investment complies with the limitations imposed by this section, the applicable limitation shall be applied to the condition of the savings bank or savings department at the time of making such investment.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Equipment, Machinery and Furnishings on New Hampshire Real Estate.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Engaging in large-scale residential housing projects of all kinds, including acquisition, subdivision and development of real estate, construction of residential housing of all kinds and related facilities, or resale to others for such construction.  For purposes of this subparagraph, a large-scale residential housing project means a development containing at least 48 home building lots or a building or buildings containing at least 48 dwelling units.

(b) Engaging in urban redevelopment projects of all kinds;  and engaging in projects to provide housing for lower-income families;

V. No such real estate development corporation shall acquire for itself any opportunity to engage in any project or venture permitted by paragraph II of this section if a savings bank which is a stockholder of such corporation has previously rejected a written application for a mortgage loan on the security of the same project or venture, unless it appears that the mortgage loan so rejected failed to qualify as a legal investment under RSA 387:4, or unless the applicant for such mortgage loan consents in writing to the acquisition of such opportunity by such real estate development corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The authority to invest in securities of certain real estate development corporations shall be limited to real estate holdings and development located in New Hampshire.
