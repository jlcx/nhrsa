Those directly secured by first mortgage on real estate situated within this state or within any state contiguous to this state;  but no such investment shall be in a loan which exceeds 75 percent of the value of the real estate by which it is secured;  except that investment may be in a loan which exceeds 75 percent but not 90 percent of the value of the real estate by which it is secured, provided that it shall be secured by a first mortgage on real estate containing one or more dwelling units for not more than 4 families each and which mortgage or mortgage note shall provide for payment of the note within a period of 40 years from the date when the first monthly payment shall become due, and the first monthly payment shall become due 9 months from the date of the note or one month from the final disbursement of funds, whichever shall first occur.

If, as a result of any revaluation, the amount of the loan is found to be in excess of the authorized percentage of the value of the premises mortgaged, a sufficient reduction in the amount of the loan shall be required, as promptly as may be practical, to bring the loan to within the authorized percentage.  In determining whether any loan exceeds the authorized percentage of the value of the real estate, no consideration shall be given to (1) that portion of the obligation which is guaranteed by the administrator of veterans' affairs under Title III of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended from time to time or (2) an obligation wholly guaranteed under such title or (3) that portion of any loan or obligation which the small business administration has unconditionally agreed to purchase or (4) that portion of a loan guaranteed by a private mortgage guaranty insurance company licensed to do business in the state of New Hampshire and approved by the bank commissioner or (5) that portion of a loan on industrial real estate guaranteed by the state of New Hampshire under RSA 162-A:14-a-14-c, or guaranteed by any state contiguous to New Hampshire under terms providing security equal to or greater than those of RSA 162-A:14-a-14-c.
