&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Registrants under this chapter who cease to engage in the business of servicing mortgage loans in this state at any time during a registration year for any cause, including but not limited to bankruptcy, registration revocation, or voluntary dissolution, shall surrender such registration in person or by registered or certified mail to the commissioner within 15 calendar days of such cessation, and shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the state a notice to such effect.  The commissioner shall adopt rules in accordance with RSA 541-A relative to such notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Withdrawal of the surrendered license becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the commissioner of the license or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless a revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the withdrawal is filed or a proceeding to revoke or suspend or to impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within 30 days after the license is surrendered.  If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines.  If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under RSA 397-B:3, VIII within one year after withdrawal became effective and may enter a revocation or suspension order as of the last date on which the license was effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section and rules adopted under this section shall be cause for denial of future license applications and the imposition of penalties under RSA 397-B:6.
