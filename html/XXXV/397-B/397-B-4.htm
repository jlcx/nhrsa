I. (a) Any mortgage servicing company which services mortgage loans secured by real property located in the state of New Hampshire shall be required to register with the banking department by filing a registration statement on a form prescribed by the commissioner and paying an original registration fee of $500 for the principal office and $500 for each branch office.  Each such registration shall expire on December 31 of each calendar year.  A registration may be renewed by filing a renewal statement on a form prescribed by the commissioner and paying a renewal registration fee of $500 for the principal office and $500 for each branch office, on or before, December 1 for registration for the ensuing year.  Sums collected under this chapter shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation of the commissioner, consumer credit administration division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The applicant shall submit any other information that the commissioner may require including, but not limited to, the applicant's form and place of organization, the applicant's tax identification number, and the applicant's proposed method of doing business.  The applicant shall disclose whether the applicant or any of its principals has ever been issued or been the subject of an injunction or administrative order, has ever been convicted of a misdemeanor involving financial services or a financial services-related business, or any fraud, false statements or omissions, theft or any wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, or a conspiracy to commit any of these offenses, or has ever been convicted of any felony.  Each principal shall provide his or her social security number and authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless the applicant is a publicly traded corporation, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the applicant's principals and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  If the applicant is a subsidiary, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on individuals who are indirect owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The persons described in subparagraph I(c) shall submit to the department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The department shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.  The department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The department may require the applicant or licensee to pay the actual costs of the background investigation and a criminal history records check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The department may rely on criminal records checks reported through a national licensing facility in lieu of (d) and (e) above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every applicant for registration under this chapter shall file with the commissioner, in such form as the commissioner prescribes by rule, irrevocable consent appointing the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action or proceeding against the applicant or the applicant's successor, executor, or administrator which arises under this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent.  A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous registration need not file another.  When any person, including any nonresident of this state, engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, and such person has not filed a consent to service of process under this section and personal jurisdiction over such person cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to such person's appointment of the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner along with $5, but is not effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

If any information filed with the commissioner becomes materially inaccurate, the registrant shall promptly submit to the commissioner an amendment to its application records that will correct the information on file with the commissioner.  An amendment shall be considered to be filed promptly if the amendment is filed within 30 days of the event that requires the filing of the amendment.
