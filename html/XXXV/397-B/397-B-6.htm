(b) Any actual damages suffered by the mortgagor as a result of such violation, including, but not limited to, late payment penalties and associated interest, and any amount which would have been paid by an insurer for a casualty or liability claim had the insurance policy not been cancelled for nonpayment by the mortgage servicing company;  and

Any person who knowingly violates any rule or order of the commissioner may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, except where another penalty is expressly provided, be subject to suspension or revocation of any registration or license, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500 for each violation, in lieu of or in addition to such suspension or revocation, as may be applicable under this title, for violation of the provision to which such rule or order relates.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who negligently violates any rule or order of the commissioner may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, except where another penalty is expressly provided, be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of any registration or license, including the forfeiture of any application fee, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $1,500 for each violation, in lieu of or in addition to such suspension or revocation, as may be applicable under this title, for violation of the provision to which such rule or order relates.

The attorney general on the commissioner's behalf, may, with or without prior administrative action by the commissioner, bring an action against any person in any superior court in this state to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, bar, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted and a receiver may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant's assets.  The court shall not require the commissioner or attorney general to post a bond.
