&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 397-B:3 Administration by Commissioner;  Rulemaking. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter and, pursuant to RSA 541-A, shall adopt such rules as the commissioner deems necessary to the administration and enforcement of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may prepare, alter, or withdraw such forms as are necessary to comply with the provisions of this title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may issue, amend, or rescind such orders as are reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may require such regular or special reports as the commissioner deems necessary to the proper supervision of registrants under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may, for good cause shown, abate all or a portion of delinquency penalties assessed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All actions taken by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall be taken only when the commissioner finds such action necessary or appropriate to the public interest or for the protection of consumers and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the commissioner finds that any registrant or applicant for registration is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a mortgage servicing company, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order revoke the registration, impose penalties, or deny the application.  The commissioner may deem abandoned and withdraw any application for registration made pursuant to this chapter, if any applicant fails to respond in writing within 180 calendar days to a written request from the commissioner requesting a response.  Such request shall be sent via certified mail to the last known address of the applicant that is on file with the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner may issue an order requiring a person to whom any registration has been granted or any person under the commissioner's jurisdiction to show cause why the registration should not be revoked or penalties should not be imposed, or both, for violations of this chapter.  The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any application or registration pending final determination of any order to show cause, cease and desist, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  A registration may be revoked for violations of this chapter or any rule or order thereunder.  The commissioner may issue a cease and desist order against any registrant or person whom he or she has reasonable cause to believe is in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon entry of an order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or registrant that the order has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing.  Valid delivery of such orders shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the applicant, registrant, or respondent or to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the registrant, applicant, or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause, cease and desist, or other order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested, shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause, cease and desist, or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII-a. If any person refuses to obey the commissioner's order, an action may be brought by the attorney general on the commissioner's behalf in any superior court in this state to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation.  In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding a temporary or permanent injunction, and awarding the commissioner or the attorney general or both costs in bringing such action.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all of the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The commissioner may by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, assess penalties and deny, suspend, or revoke any registration or application, and bar any person from registration if the commissioner finds that the order is in the public interest and the applicant or registrant, any partner, officer, member, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, respondent, or registrant:

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A registrant shall keep and use business records in such form and at such location as the commissioner shall by rule determine.  The records shall enable the commissioner to determine whether the registrant is complying with the provisions of this chapter, any rules adopted under it, and any other law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is registered under this chapter.  The rules may contain provisions for records to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by any process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original record or document, or in any other form or manner authorized by the commissioner.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit any registrant to destroy original records or documents.  Each registrant shall preserve all such business records for as long a period as the commissioner shall prescribe by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the commissioner or examiner finds any business records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such business records after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each registrant shall file, under oath, an annual report with the banking department on or before March 31 each year concerning operations for the preceding year or registration period ending December 31 upon the form prescribed by the banking department.  Any mortgage servicing company failing to file the annual report required by this section within the time prescribed may be required to pay to the department a penalty of $25 for each calendar day the annual report is overdue up to a maximum penalty of $2,500 per report.

Any mortgage servicing company which receives funds from a mortgagor to be held in escrow for payment of taxes and insurance premiums shall pay the taxes and insurance premiums of the mortgagor to the appropriate taxing authority and insurance company in the amount required and at the time such taxes and insurance premiums are due, provided that the mortgage servicing company has been provided with the tax or insurance bills at least 15 days prior to the date such taxes and insurance premiums are due, and the mortgagor has paid to the mortgage servicing company the amounts required to be paid into the escrow account, as determined by the mortgage servicing company, for all amounts scheduled to be paid to the mortgage servicing company prior to the date such taxes and insurance premiums are due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each mortgage servicing company shall, through its own effort and expense, determine and notify the mortgagor of the amounts necessary to be paid into the escrow account to assure that sufficient funds will be available for the payment of such taxes and insurance premiums as of the date such payment is due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the amount held in the escrow account as of the date such taxes and insurance premiums are due is insufficient to pay the taxes and insurance premiums despite compliance by the mortgagor with RSA 397-B:5, I, the mortgage servicing company shall pay such taxes and insurance premiums from its own funds.  The mortgage servicing company shall then give the mortgagor the option of paying the deficiency over a period of not less than 12 months.  The mortgage servicing company shall not charge or collect interest on such deficiency during the 12-month period.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department may examine the business affairs and records of any registrant or any other person, whether registered or not, as it deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to it.  In determining compliance, the department may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents or matters of any registrant or person.  The department shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceedings, and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, and other documents and materials relevant to its investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter, the banking department may examine, during business hours, the records of any registrant and of any person acting as a mortgage servicer on New Hampshire loans, whether such person shall be registered to act, or claim to act, as principal, agent, or other representative, or under, or without the authority of this chapter;  and for that purpose, the banking department shall have access to the books, papers, records, files, and vaults of all such persons.  The banking department shall also have authority to examine, under oath, all persons whose testimony it may require relative to such loans or business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The affairs and records of every registrant shall be subject at any time to such periodic, special, regular, or other examination by the banking department with or without notice to the registrant.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The expense of examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the registrant.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the registrant or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel employed in making examinations shall be chargeable to and paid by such registrant or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a mortgage servicer, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may share information and cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners, the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.

IX. If requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in paragraph VIII, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in paragraph VIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 397-B:9-b Record Keeping. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The registrant shall maintain records to enable the department to determine whether the registrant's business is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted by the department.  Such records shall be maintained in a readily accessible location and made available for examination at the registrant's New Hampshire principal office or its New Hampshire branch office location or the office of its New Hampshire agent for a period of at least 3 years after the registrant's last transaction on a loan file.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Registrants that maintain their files and business records in another state shall return such files to their principal or branch New Hampshire office, to the banking department, or to the office of their New Hampshire agent for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the department.  When the commissioner requests a loan list or other similar summary document from a registrant from which to select particular files for review, the registrant shall ensure that the list or information is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days, and then shall provide the files and information selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21 day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a registrant or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the department shall be sufficient cause for registration revocation, suspension, or denial.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A registrant shall keep and use business records in such form and at such location as the commissioner shall by rule determine.  The records shall enable the commissioner to determine whether the registrant is complying with the provisions of this chapter, any rules adopted under it, and any other law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is registered under this chapter.  The rules may contain provisions for records to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by any process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original record or document, or in any other form or manner authorized by the commissioner.  For their own business purposes, a registrant may maintain photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or digital copies of original documents.  However, nothing in this section shall be construed to permit any registrant to destroy original records or documents.  Each registrant shall preserve all such business records for as long a period as the commissioner shall prescribe by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner or examiner finds any records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.
