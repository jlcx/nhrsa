&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 396:7 Removal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner may remove a conservator at pleasure.  He shall terminate such appointment when he deems the interest of the depositors and other creditors no longer requires conservatorship and permit such institution to resume the transaction of its business subject to such terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations as he may prescribe.  If at any time the commissioner deems it in the interest of depositors and other creditors to liquidate any institution under his supervision, whether under regulation or conservatorship or not, he may proceed under the provisions of RSA 395, and the appointment of a conservator of such institution may be vacated or continued by order of court thereunder.
