A majority of the stock or shareholders of any institution under the supervision of the commissioner by stock or share vote, or a majority of the corporation members of a mutual savings bank, may submit to the commissioner at any time a plan for reorganization of such institution or bank.  Such plan shall be in writing and shall be signed by the applicants.  If such plan does not provide for the reduction or deferring of payment of the amount standing to the credit of any depositor or for the reduction of the amount or deferring of payment due any other creditor, said plan shall become effective upon approval of the commissioner.
