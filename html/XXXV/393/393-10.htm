&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 393:10 Minors. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A minor may hold shares of such corporation, subject to the liabilities of a shareholder, for the purpose of depositing monthly dues thereon until the same are matured, withdrawn, forfeited or canceled, as in the case of other shareholders of such associations, and for no other purpose.  Such associations may pay to minors when their shares are matured, withdrawn, or canceled, the deposits or collections on shares standing in their names, with the interest, premiums, fines, or profits that may be due thereon, as if such minors were of age, and their receipts shall be sufficient discharge of the same as in the case of payment to minors of deposits to their credit by savings banks.
