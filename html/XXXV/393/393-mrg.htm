&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The bank commissioner may require as a condition to approval of a corporation to be organized under this chapter that the incorporators shall purchase initially not less than $10,000 fully paid shares of such corporation, that said incorporating shareholders shall expressly waive their withdrawal, retirement and repayment rights under RSA 393:30-34 and stipulate in the records of such corporation that no withdrawal, retirement, redemption or repayment, other than in liquidation of such corporation, shall be made and no direct payment in division of profits under RSA 393:29 shall be made to the holders of such shares so issued to said incorporating stockholders but all divisions of profits allocable to such shares shall be paid into the guaranty fund provided in RSA 393:26.  Such condition shall appear on the face of the shares so initially issued to said incorporators.  At such time that the guaranty fund of such corporation accrues sufficiently so that withdrawal or retirement or repayment of all such shares with all divisions of profits accrued to the credit thereof will not diminish the said guaranty fund below $10,000 the commissioner may authorize removal of said conditions affecting such shares.

I. The department may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the incorporators, officers and directors, and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  The department may also complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on any person, including an individual, that owns, beneficially owns, has the right to vote, or has the power to sell or direct the sale of 10 percent or more of the petitioner.  If the petitioner is a subsidiary, the department may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the individuals who are the indirect owners, as defined in RSA 397-A:1, VIII-a.

I. A cooperative bank or building and loan association or savings and loan association may loan its funds upon the security of a lien on real estate provided that no more than one percent of the assets of the association is loaned on any one property and provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Loans supported by a first mortgage lien in excess of $10,000 may not exceed 90 percent of the appraised value of any one property and loans in excess of $55,000 may not exceed 80 percent of the appraised value on any one property;  provided, however, that loans on real estate containing one or more dwelling units for not more than 4 families each may not exceed 90 percent of the appraised value of the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Loans supported by a second mortgage lien on improved real estate may also be made, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Such real estate shall be subject to a valid first mortgage lien of a bank whose principal place of business is in this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The net proceeds of any such loan shall not exceed 80 percent of the appraised value of such real estate at the time the loan is to be made, less the outstanding principal balance and advances made under the provisions of RSA 479:4 of the first mortgage lien;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Each such loan shall be evidenced by one or more negotiable notes and shall be secured by a valid mortgage lien subordinate only to first mortgage lien;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Each loan shall be repayable on demand or in regular monthly installments within 25 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. These limitations shall not apply to loans insured or guaranteed by the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Veterans Administration, the state of New Hampshire or by a private mortgage guaranty insurance company licensed to do business in the state of New Hampshire and approved by the bank commissioner.  Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations of this section, an association may make a loan in connection with the sale of real estate acquired by the association for the purpose of providing offices for the transaction of business of the association or acquired under a foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure in amount not to exceed the sale price the association received from such real estate.

Any such corporation may pay taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, and other charges for the protection of the real estate loans it services and such payments may either be added to the balance of the real estate loan or carried as a separate account and all such payments shall be equally secured by the mortgage on the property.  It may also require the borrower to pay monthly in advance in addition to interest and principal payments, the equivalent of  1/12 of the estimated annual taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, and any other charges upon the real estate securing a loan, so as to enable the bank or association to pay such charges as they become due from the funds so received.  The amount of such monthly charges may be increased or decreased so as to provide reasonably for the payment of these expenses.  Any such corporation at its option may hold such funds in escrow and commingle them with other such funds and use the same for such purposes or credit such funds as received to the mortgage account.  If the funds are credited to the mortgage account the bank or association may also charge against the mortgage account the amount of any of the aforementioned payments.  Any such funds held in escrow shall be pledged to further secure the indebtedness and if held in open account or credited to the loan account the sums when advanced for the purposes stated shall be secured by the mortgage with the same priority as the original amount advanced under the mortgage.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Upon the conversion of a federal savings and loan association into a state building and loan association or cooperative bank, the corporate existence of such association shall not terminate, but such state association shall be deemed to be a continuation of the entity of the association so converted and all property of the converted association, including its rights, titles and interests in and to all property of whatsoever kind, whether real, personal, or mixed, and things in action, and every right, privilege, interest, and asset of any conceivable value or benefit then existing, or pertaining to it, or which would inure to it, shall immediately by act of law and without any conveyance or transfer and without any further act or deed remain and be vested in and continue and be the property of such state association into which the federal association has converted itself, and such state association shall have, hold and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the same was possessed, held and enjoyed by the converting association, and such state association as of the time of the taking effect of such conversion shall continue to have and succeed to all the rights, obligations, and relations of the converting association.  All pending actions and other judicial proceedings to which the converting federal association is a party shall not be deemed to have been abated or to have been discontinued by reason of such conversion, but may be prosecuted to final judgment, order or decree in the same manner as if such conversion had not been made and such state association resulting from such conversion may continue such action in its corporate name as a state association, and any judgment, order or decree may be rendered for or against it, which might have been rendered for or against the converting federal association theretofore involved in such judicial proceedings.

In the event that any such retirement plan which, in the judgment of an association, constituted a qualified plan under the provisions of said "Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962'' as amended by the "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,'' and as said act may be further amended from time to time, and the regulations promulgated thereunder at the time the trust was established and accepted by the association, is subsequently determined not to be such a qualified plan, in whole or in part, the association may, nevertheless, continue to act as trustee of any funds theretofore delivered to it under such plan and to dispose of the same in accordance with the directions of the grantor and the beneficiaries thereof.  No association, in respect of funds of which it is trustee under this section, shall be required to segregate such funds for purposes of investment, unless the trust instrument so provides;  but an association shall keep appropriate records for each trust showing in proper detail all transactions engaged in under the authority of this section.
