&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 393:7 Value of Serial Shares. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Serial shares shall be divided into shares of an ultimate value of $100 or multiple thereof.  However, the ultimate value of the serial shares pledged in amount to repay the loan upon maturity shall not exceed a multiple that would extend the term of the loan in excess of 30 years.  Such shares may be issued in quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly series, each series to consist of such number of shares as the directors may determine, but no shares of a prior series shall be issued until said series shall have been 5 years in force.
