<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Upon issuance by the commissioner of a no-objection letter or a determination of approval in response to a dissolution notice under RSA 383-C:10-1004, the trust company may dissolve in accordance with the terms of its dissolution notice and plan for dissolution.  Upon completion of all actions required under the plan for dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the commissioner, the dissolving trust company shall submit a report of its actions to the commissioner and the dissolving trust company's board of directors shall certify, under oath, that it is true and correct.  Following receipt of the report, the commissioner may examine the trust company to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken to liquidate or reorganize the trust company in accordance with the plan for dissolution and any conditions prescribed.  Following receipt of the dissolving trust company's report and after determining that the plan for dissolution and any conditions prescribed have been satisfied, the commissioner shall notify the dissolving trust that the dissolution has been completed and is final, which notice shall supplement the prior no-objection or approval of dissolution issued by the commissioner under RSA 383-A:6-604.  Thereupon, the dissolving trust company shall surrender its charter to the commissioner, and the commissioner shall issue a certificate of dissolution to be filed with the secretary of state.  If the commissioner is not satisfied that all required actions have been taken, then the commissioner shall notify the dissolving trust company what additional actions shall be taken to be eligible for a certificate of dissolution, which notice shall supplement the prior no-objection or approval of dissolution issued by the commissioner under RSA 383-A:6-604.  In the notice, the commissioner may establish a deadline for the submission of evidence that the additional actions have been taken.  The commissioner may extend the deadline for good cause shown.  If the applicant fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, then the commissioner may issue an order under RSA 383-A:6-604 denying the dissolution and reversing any prior approval or no-objection.

After the commissioner issues a certificate of dissolution under RSA 383-C:10-1006, the applicant shall file with the secretary of state the certificate of dissolution and shall pay to the secretary of state any filing a fee required by the applicable Organizations Act.  In the case of a reorganization, the applicant shall also file with the secretary of state the documents that, under the applicable Organization Act, are required to complete the statutory reorganization as approved by the commissioner, including the organizational documents for the reorganized entity.
