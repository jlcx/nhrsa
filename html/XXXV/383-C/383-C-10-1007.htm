<codesect>
After the commissioner issues a certificate of dissolution under RSA 383-C:10-1006, the applicant shall file with the secretary of state the certificate of dissolution and shall pay to the secretary of state any filing a fee required by the applicable Organizations Act.  In the case of a reorganization, the applicant shall also file with the secretary of state the documents that, under the applicable Organization Act, are required to complete the statutory reorganization as approved by the commissioner, including the organizational documents for the reorganized entity.  The secretary of state shall record the certificate and other documents, if any, and, consistent with its practice and applicable law, the secretary of state may issue a certificate evidencing the liquidation or reorganization.  Upon acceptance by the secretary of state of the filing of a certificate of dissolution issued under RSA 383-C:10-1006, and the issuance of any certificate or acknowledgment by the secretary of state, the dissolving trust company shall be deemed to have been voluntarily dissolved or reorganized, as applicable, with the same effect as if the voluntary dissolution or reorganization had been effected by an entity subject to the applicable Organizational Act.
