&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-A:2 Organization. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A merchant bank may be organized by one or more New Hampshire financial institutions as a nondepository trust company pursuant to RSA 392.  The organizational instruments of a merchant bank shall contain a statement to the effect that it may not solicit, receive, or accept money or its equivalent as a savings deposit, time deposit, demand deposit, or any other type of instrument or facility of like character or nature.  A merchant bank shall be subject to and governed by the provisions of RSA 392 that relate to nondepository trust companies and other applicable banking statutes, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  The provisions of this chapter shall govern any conflicting or inconsistent provisions in RSA 392 or any other chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a merchant bank may be organized as a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership.  A merchant bank organized as a business entity other than a corporation shall be subject to the provisions of state law applicable to such type of entity, provided, however, any filing required to be made with the secretary of state shall be made instead with the bank commissioner.  Any reference to a corporation in the banking statutes shall also include any other type of business entity for purposes of this chapter.  A noncorporate merchant bank shall be subject to all of the same laws and regulations that relate to a corporate merchant bank.  Any partner, manager, or senior management official of a noncorporate merchant bank shall be subject to the same duties and liabilities as pertain to directors, trustees, and senior management officials of a corporate merchant bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any New Hampshire financial institution is authorized to invest in a merchant bank organized under this chapter.  The amount of the investment shall not exceed 25 percent of the New Hampshire financial institution's capital and surplus, except that if the New Hampshire financial institution owns all or a majority of the voting shares of the merchant bank, its investment shall not exceed the investment limitation set forth in RSA 384:16-b, I for service corporations which is 10 percent of its savings deposits or capital funds, whichever may be greater.  One or more accredited investors may participate in the organization of, and invest in, a merchant bank, provided that at least a majority of the voting rights of the merchant bank are controlled at all times directly or indirectly by one or more New Hampshire financial institutions.  The organizers of the merchant bank shall submit a list of all investors in the bank and the amount of their respective investments.  This list shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by each investor attesting to its eligibility to invest in the merchant bank, as part of the petition submitted under RSA 392:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any New Hampshire financial institution may reorganize into a merchant bank by submitting an application to reorganize with the board of trust company incorporation and complying with the organization requirements of RSA 392, as applicable.  The application of the New Hampshire financial institution shall be signed by a majority of the members of the board of directors.  The reorganization shall be approved by a  2/3 majority of the members of the board of directors and a  2/3 majority of each class of shareholders.  If the reorganization is approved by the board of trust company incorporation, notice of the reorganization shall be filed with the office of the secretary of state at the same time the charter of the merchant bank is filed pursuant to RSA 392:17.  The certificate of incorporation issued by the secretary of state pursuant to RSA 392:18 shall make reference to the reorganization authorized by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The business and affairs of a merchant bank shall be governed by a board of directors, if it is a corporation, or its equivalent governing body if it is any other type of business entity, composed of at least 5 natural persons.  No person shall serve as a director if the merchant bank is a corporation, or as a member of its governing body if it is any other type of organization, at any time without the prior approval of the bank commissioner.  The bank commissioner shall review the background, experience, and financial integrity of a person proposed for service as a director or member of its governing body.  The person shall apply to the bank commissioner for approval to serve in that capacity and shall submit such information as may be required by the bank commissioner to make a decision.  The bank commissioner shall make a decision within 30 days of receipt of a complete application.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-A:3 Capital;  Other Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A merchant bank shall maintain capital at a level which is commensurate with the risk undertaken in connection with its loans, investments, and other activities, as determined annually by its board of directors, if it is a corporation, or its equivalent governing body if it is any other type of business entity, but in no event shall its capital be less than 6 percent of its assets.  The initial capital of a merchant bank shall consist of common stock in the amount of at least $2,500,000 paid in the form of cash or its equivalent.  The balance of any capital required by the board of trust company incorporation may consist of preferred stock or other equity capital, subordinated notes, or debentures, as approved by said board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the capital structure of a New Hampshire financial institution that reorganizes into a merchant bank may continue in the same form and amount as existed at the time of reorganization, provided that the capital is at least $2,500,000.  A merchant bank may borrow funds to engage in the merchant banking business only from accredited investors.  Following the organization or reorganization of a merchant bank, if the bank commissioner finds that the capital is inadequate based on the risk profile of its investments, the bank commissioner may require that the capital be increased by an amount necessary to protect the safety and soundness of the merchant bank.  A merchant bank may voluntarily dissolve, either by liquidation or reorganization into another type of business entity, in accordance with the provisions of RSA 392.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-A:4 Business of Merchant Banks. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Except as provided in this chapter, a merchant bank has all the powers of and is entitled to engage in the business of a trust company, including without limitation, powers with respect to investments, loans, and fiduciary and trust functions and transactions.  In furtherance of assisting small businesses, a merchant bank may provide commercial and investment banking services, act as a securities broker or dealer or an investment advisor, underwrite securities of small businesses, and invest in the equity or debt securities of any small business.  A merchant bank shall comply with applicable federal and state securities laws.  A merchant bank shall not solicit, receive, or accept money or its equivalent as a savings deposit, time deposit, demand deposit, or any other type of instrument or facility of like character or nature.  No initial investment by the merchant bank in a small business shall constitute "control'' as such term is defined in the rules and regulations of the United States Small Business Administration with respect to investments of small business investment companies, as amended from time to time, except as is permitted in such rules and regulations.  No financial institution which is an owner of an interest in a merchant bank shall condition the extension of credit to a small business that meets its ordinary underwriting standards on a requirement that the merchant bank be allowed to invest in, or obtain rights with respect to the equity capital of, the small business.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-A:5 Policy for Business Activities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The board of directors of a merchant bank if it is a corporation, or its equivalent governing body if it is any other type of business entity, shall establish a written policy under which the merchant bank's business activities are conducted.  The policy shall also address conflicts of interest and shall preclude a merchant bank from making an investment in a small business if the effect is to create the potential of a conflict in interest with a person having an ownership interest in the merchant bank.  The policy for business activities shall be reviewed and ratified by the board of directors or equivalent governing body at least annually and shall be submitted to the bank commissioner.  If the bank commissioner finds that the policy does not adequately regulate the business activities of the merchant bank, the bank commissioner may require the board of directors or equivalent governing body to take corrective action.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-A:6 Reports;  Change in Control. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In addition to any reports that are required to be submitted by a trust company under state laws and regulations, a merchant bank shall submit a quarterly report to the bank commissioner describing its business activities for the quarter.  The merchant bank shall also submit an annual report to the bank commissioner listing all of the investors in the bank and the amount of their respective investments and voting rights, which report shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by each investor who has not previously submitted a certificate to the bank commissioner attesting to its eligibility to invest in the merchant bank.  No change in control of a merchant bank shall occur without the prior approval of the bank commissioner.  The term "change of control'' shall mean the direct or indirect acquisition by a person or group of persons acting in concert of 10 percent or more of the beneficial ownership or control of the voting shares.  The person or group seeking to acquire control of the merchant bank shall submit an application to the bank commissioner for approval which shall contain such financial, business, experience, and other information as the bank commissioner shall require to determine whether such person or group is suitable to exercise control of a merchant bank.  Upon receipt of a complete application, the bank commissioner may hold a hearing on such application and shall make a decision within 60 days after receipt of the application.
