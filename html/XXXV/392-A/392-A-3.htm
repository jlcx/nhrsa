&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-A:3 Capital;  Other Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A merchant bank shall maintain capital at a level which is commensurate with the risk undertaken in connection with its loans, investments, and other activities, as determined annually by its board of directors, if it is a corporation, or its equivalent governing body if it is any other type of business entity, but in no event shall its capital be less than 6 percent of its assets.  The initial capital of a merchant bank shall consist of common stock in the amount of at least $2,500,000 paid in the form of cash or its equivalent.  The balance of any capital required by the board of trust company incorporation may consist of preferred stock or other equity capital, subordinated notes, or debentures, as approved by said board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the capital structure of a New Hampshire financial institution that reorganizes into a merchant bank may continue in the same form and amount as existed at the time of reorganization, provided that the capital is at least $2,500,000.  A merchant bank may borrow funds to engage in the merchant banking business only from accredited investors.  Following the organization or reorganization of a merchant bank, if the bank commissioner finds that the capital is inadequate based on the risk profile of its investments, the bank commissioner may require that the capital be increased by an amount necessary to protect the safety and soundness of the merchant bank.  A merchant bank may voluntarily dissolve, either by liquidation or reorganization into another type of business entity, in accordance with the provisions of RSA 392.
