I. No licensee shall conduct the business of a mortgage banker, mortgage broker, or mortgage servicer under a trade name or any other name different from the name stated in its principal office license or branch office license without immediately notifying the commissioner, who shall then amend the license accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A mortgage banker, mortgage broker, or mortgage servicer licensee shall submit written notification to the department of the addition or deletion of a principal and shall provide the name and address of each new principal no later than 30 days after such change.  Each new principal shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The commissioner shall investigate management and ownership changes including, but not limited to, each principal's qualifications and business history.  The licensee shall disclose any injunction or administrative order that has been issued against the principal and whether the principal has been convicted of a misdemeanor involving financial services or a financial services-related business or any fraud, false statements, or omissions, theft or any wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, or a conspiracy to commit any of these offenses or convicted of any felony, prior to the commissioner's approval of such change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Mortgage banker, mortgage broker, or mortgage servicer licensees shall provide written notice to the banking department of any proposed change in location or proposed closing of any licensed office no later than 10 business days prior to the effective date of such change of location or closing, unless such change of location or closing occurs under circumstances beyond the control of the licensee whereby such written notice shall be provided within 10 business days from the date the licensee becomes aware of the closing or relocation.  Failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may be deemed sufficient cause for license revocation or denial of license renewal applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Persons licensed under this chapter are under a continuing obligation to update information on file with the commissioner.  If any information filed with the commissioner becomes materially inaccurate, the licensee must promptly submit to the commissioner an amendment to its application records that will correct the information on file with the commissioner.  An amendment shall be considered to be filed promptly if the amendment is filed within 30 days of the event that requires the filing of the amendment.  Certain significant events as defined by rule shall be reported to the department in writing within 10 calendar days.
