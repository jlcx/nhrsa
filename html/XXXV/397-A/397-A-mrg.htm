At a minimum, the application shall state the primary business address of the applicant, the applicant's tax identification number, the address of its principal office and all branch offices, and a list of the principals of the applicant.  Each principal shall provide his or her social security number and shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The applicant shall submit any other information that the commissioner may require including, but not limited to, the applicant's form and place of organization, the applicant's proposed method of doing business, the qualifications and business history of the applicant and its principals, and the applicant's financial condition and history.  The applicant shall disclose whether the applicant or any of its principals has ever been issued or been the subject of an injunction or administrative order, has ever been convicted of a misdemeanor involving financial services or a financial services-related business or any fraud, false statements or omissions, theft or any wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, or a conspiracy to commit any of these offenses or has ever been convicted of any felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Unless the mortgage banker or mortgage broker applicant is a publicly traded corporation, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the applicant's principals and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  If the applicant is a subsidiary, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the individuals who are indirect owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The persons described in subparagraph II(a) shall submit to the department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The department shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The mortgage banker or mortgage broker license issued for the licensee's principal place of business shall be referred to as a "principal office license.''  Each additional license issued for New Hampshire mortgage lending or brokering activity occurring in a location that is separate from the licensee's principal place of business shall be referred to as a "branch office license.''  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Each mortgage banker or mortgage broker license application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $500 for each separate office location to be licensed.  Sums collected under this chapter shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the commissioner, consumer credit administration division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each mortgage banker or mortgage broker applicant shall be required to submit to the department detailed financial information sufficient for the commissioner to determine the applicant's ability to conduct the business of a mortgage banker or a mortgage broker with financial integrity.  The mortgage broker's application shall include a statement of net worth prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles.  The mortgage banker's application shall include a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, statement of owner's equity, and note disclosure, and shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  An applicant or licensee shall demonstrate and maintain a minimum positive net worth and an amount of minimum positive net worth shall be set by rule.  Minimum net worth shall be maintained in an amount that reflects the dollar amount of loans originated as determined by the commissioner.  Net worth statements provided in connection with a license application under this section shall be subject to review and verification during the course of any examination or investigation conducted under the authority of RSA 397-A:12.  Each mortgage banker applicant shall post a continuous surety bond in the minimum amount of $100,000 to the commissioner that shall be increased under conditions set by rule.  Each mortgage broker shall post a continuous surety bond in the minimum amount of $50,000 to the commissioner that shall be increased under conditions set by rule.

Surety bonds shall include a provision requiring the surety to give written notice to the commissioner 20 days in advance of the cancellation or termination of the bond.  Every bond shall provide that no recovery may be made against the bond unless the state makes a claim for recovery or the person brings suit naming the licensee within 6 years after the act upon which the recovery or suit is based.  When an action is commenced on a licensee's bond, the licensee shall immediately file a new bond.  Immediately upon recovery upon any action on the bond the licensee shall file a new bond.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) No person shall be issued or continue to hold a mortgage banker or mortgage broker license unless at least one person employed full-time in a supervisory capacity at the company's principal office shall have been actively engaged in the mortgage business in a similar supervisory capacity for a minimum of 3 of the preceding 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Mortgage bankers shall designate an individual contact person who shall be a control person of their organization to communicate with department personnel on foreclosure workouts and foreclosure avoidance procedures.  The contact person shall have authority to facilitate foreclosure workouts, and foreclosure avoidance procedures.

A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous registration need not file another.  When any person, including any nonresident of this state, engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, and such person has not filed a consent to service of process under this section and personal jurisdiction over such person cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to such person's appointment of the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner along with $5, but is not effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The plaintiff, who may be the attorney general in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him or her, forthwith sends a notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at such person's last address on file with the commissioner;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this paragraph is filed in the case on or before the date specified by the court on the summons, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a.

The application shall be signed under oath by both the originator applicant and the licensed mortgage banker or mortgage broker for whom the individual will originate mortgage loans.  Each licensed mortgage originator shall register with and maintain a valid unique identifier issued by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.  At a minimum, the application shall state the primary business address of the applicant and the applicant's social security number and shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The applicant shall submit any other information that the commissioner and the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry may require including, but not limited to, the applicant's residential and employment history.  The applicant shall disclose his or her financial, criminal, regulatory civil, arbitration, civil litigation, and employment termination history, including but not limited to, whether the applicant has ever been issued or been the subject of an injunction or administrative order or has ever been charged with or convicted of a misdemeanor or any felony.  Each license application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable license fee of $100.  If, in connection with an application for licensure as a mortgage loan originator, the banking department does not receive a response to an inquiry or request for further information within 60 days from the date of such inquiry or request, the department may withdraw as abandoned the application.  A mortgage originator's license may be transferred during a calendar year from one mortgage banker or mortgage broker to another upon payment of a $50 fee and approval by the commissioner.  Sums collected under this chapter shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the commissioner, consumer credit administration division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A mortgage banker or mortgage broker licensee shall submit written notification to the department of the addition or deletion of a principal and shall provide the name and address of each new principal no later than 30 days after such change.  Each new principal shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.

I. (a) A licensee who ceases to engage in the business of a mortgage banker, mortgage broker, or originator, at any time during a license year for any cause, including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, license revocation, or voluntary dissolution, shall surrender, by notice to the commissioner or by return of such paper license, if a paper license was issued, in person, through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, or by registered or certified mail to the commissioner within 15 calendar days of such cessation, and mortgage banker and mortgage broker licensees shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the licensee's market area a notice to such effect.

(b) Withdrawal of the surrendered license becomes effective upon receipt by the commissioner of the notice or license, unless a revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the withdrawal is filed or a proceeding to revoke or suspend or to impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within 30 days after the license is surrendered.  If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines.  If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under RSA 397-A:17 within one year after withdrawal became effective and may enter a revocation or suspension order as of the last date on which the license was effective.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 397-A:11 Record Keeping. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The licensee shall maintain such records as will enable the department to determine whether the licensee's business is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to it.  Such records shall be maintained in a readily accessible location and made available for examination at the licensee's New Hampshire principal office or its New Hampshire branch office location or the office of its New Hampshire agent for a period of at least 3 years after the licensee's final transaction on a loan or application file.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Those licensees that maintain their files and business records in another state are required to return such files to their principal or branch New Hampshire office, to the banking department, or to the office of their New Hampshire agent for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the department.  When the commissioner requests a loan list or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days, and provide the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the licensee retains a mortgage loan in its loan portfolio or services a loan it originated, an adequate loan payment history for such loan shall be made available to the department upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A licensee shall keep and use business records in such form and at such location as the commissioner shall by rule determine.  The records shall enable the commissioner to determine whether the licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter, any rules adopted under it, and any other law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  The rules may contain provisions for records to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by any process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original record or document, or in any other form or manner authorized by the commissioner.  For their own business purposes, a licensee may maintain photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or digital copies of original documents.  However, nothing in this section shall be construed to permit any licensee to destroy original records or documents.  Each licensee shall preserve all such business records for as long a period as the commissioner shall prescribe by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the commissioner or examiner finds any records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.

The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination, shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a mortgage banker or mortgage broker, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations and investigations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate and share information with the regulators of this state and other states, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In any investigation to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, upon the commissioner's finding that the person violated this chapter or a rule or order under this chapter, or the person charged with the violation being found in default, the commissioner shall be entitled to recover the cost of the investigation, in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners, the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in paragraph VIII, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in paragraph VIII.  The report shall be accepted and filed within 6 months after the final hearing thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. All reports pursuant to this section shall be absolutely privileged and although filed in the department as provided in paragraph IX shall nevertheless not be for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be deemed confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Each licensee or person subject to this chapter shall make or compile reports or prepare other information as directed by the commissioner in order to carry out the purposes of the chapter including but not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Accounting compilations;

(b) Information lists and data concerning loan transactions in a format prescribed by the commissioner;  and
<br>

(c) Such other information deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of the chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. In making any examination or investigation authorized by this chapter, the commissioner may control access to any documents and records of the licensee or person under examination or investigation.  The commissioner may take possession of the documents and records or place a person in exclusive charge of the documents and records in the place where they are usually kept.  During the period of control, no person shall remove or attempt to remove any of the documents and records except pursuant to a court order or with the consent of the commissioner.  Unless the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe the documents or records of the licensee have been, or are at risk of, being altered or destroyed for purposes of concealing a violation of this chapter, the licensee or owner of the documents and records shall have access to the documents or records as necessary to conduct its ordinary business affairs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The authority of this section shall remain in effect, whether a licensee or person subject to this chapter acts or claims to act under any licensing or registration law of this state, or claims to act without such authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. The authority of this section shall extend to any person who has custody of or control over documents within the jurisdiction of the commissioner including but not limited to title companies and other settlement providers who shall provide loan documents to the commissioner upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. No licensee or person subject to investigation or examination under this section may knowingly withhold, abstract, remove, mutilate, destroy, or secrete any books, records, computer records, or other information.  Such actions shall be fraud under the chapter.

III. The advance collection of interest from a borrower shall only be permitted upon the origination of a mortgage loan and shall be computed on a simple interest per annum basis.  Prepaid interest shall not be collected for a period of greater than 31 days and such method may be used by the lender to achieve a common loan payment date for all of its loans, such as the first day of the month.  Collection and application of a regularly scheduled monthly payment before the due date shall not be considered as the advance collection of interest on a mortgage home loan under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No licensee shall refuse a written, reasonable request from an applicant or borrower for a copy of documentation in the licensee's file relative to the borrower's loan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Persons subject to or licensed under this chapter that service mortgage loans on real property located in the state of New Hampshire shall, within 5 days of receipt of a written request, provide a net payoff amount as of a specific date with a daily interest rate charge.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Upon payment in full of the outstanding principal, interest, and other charges due on a mortgage loan, the holder shall mark plainly the note or a copy thereof with the words "PAID IN FULL'' or "CANCELLED'' and release or provide the borrower evidence to release any mortgage or security instrument no longer securing any indebtedness to the holder.  If the original is retained by the lender, the original shall be returned within a reasonable period of time upon the written request of the borrower.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In a reverse mortgage transaction, any credit derived from offering an interest rate higher than the par rate shall only be paid to the borrower or used to pay the borrower's costs, and shall not be used as an additional source of compensation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. (a) Every field on the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Good Faith Estimate (GFE) form shall be completed before it is given to a borrower.  The Tradeoff Table on the instruction page of the GFE shall be completed when the originating company is not funding the loan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At the time the interest rate is locked for a loan the borrower shall be given a completed GFE Tradeoff Table for such loan;  the intent is to allow the borrower to clearly see the loan options available to him or her that he or she did not elect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When completing the GFE Tradeoff Table, if a loan with a lower interest rate is not available to a borrower an entry of "N/A'' is acceptable and if a loan with lower settlement charges is not available an entry of "N/A'' is acceptable.

(d) A copy of each disclosure, including those required by IX(a)-(c), and its method and timing of delivery shall be kept by the mortgage broker and by the mortgage banker.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers shall have a documented methodology, approved by a senior manager, that enables its employees, agents, and originators to make a reasonable determination that the borrower can repay a mortgage loan.  The methodology shall reflect all relevant factors that have a bearing on the present and future capacity of the borrower to adequately service the debt.  A mortgage banker, mortgage broker, and mortgage originator shall not offer or extend a mortgage loan to a borrower unless a reasonable lender would believe at the time the loan is made that the borrower will be able to make the scheduled payments associated with the loan.  The loan file kept by the mortgage banker, mortgage broker, and mortgage originator shall document the analysis used to arrive at that conclusion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. A person, or its affiliate, brokering or funding a reverse mortgage shall not participate in, or be associated with, or employ any party that participates in or is associated with, any other financial or insurance activity and a mortgagor shall not be required, directly or indirectly, as a condition of obtaining a mortgage, to purchase any other financial or insurance product.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 397-A:16-a Lender's and Borrower's Rights;  Second Mortgage Debt. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The allowable rate of interest computed on the unpaid balance that any person may directly or indirectly charge, take, or receive for a second mortgage loan secured by property which is occupied in whole or in part at the time said loan is made as a home by any obligor on the mortgage debt or by any person granting or releasing any interest under said mortgage shall be the rate agreed upon in the note between borrower and lender, and following the sixth month of any period in which a loan has been in continuous default, not more than 1  1/2 percent per month on any unpaid balances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the charges which may be collected on any second mortgage loan made under this chapter for the period beginning 6 months after the originally scheduled final installment date of a loan other than an open-end loan, or for the period beginning 6 months after the final due date of an open-end loan as established by the term applicable to the loan from time to time in accordance with the open-end note or loan agreement and ending with date of payment of the loan in full shall not exceed 18 percent per annum simple interest on the balances outstanding from time to time during said period.  If the loan is an open-end loan the borrower's privilege for further loans shall not be reinstated by the licensee where the rate has been reduced under the preceding sentence unless the borrower executes a new open-end loan agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The borrower shall have the right to anticipate his or her second mortgage debt in whole or in part upon payment of any prepayment penalty agreed upon between borrower and licensee, provided, however, that any penalty shall be clearly set forth in the loan documents;  except that there shall be no penalty charged for prepayment of a second mortgage home loan after the loan has been in existence for 5 years.  When an open-end loan agreement providing for advances from time to time by the licensee exists between the borrower and the licensee, monthly loan payments shall be selected by the borrower as stated in the note or open-end agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless otherwise provided in the note, second mortgage loan payments shall be applied on the scheduled payment dates.  Except where the borrower agrees in writing to a different application of his payments, in cases where partial payments are made, the interest shall be calculated to the time of payments, and such payment shall first be applied to interest, and the balance thereafter remaining, if any, shall be applied to principal.  In addition to the interest permitted under this section, the lender may contract for and receive any additional other charge, as defined by RSA 358-K:1, XIII, as may be agreed upon by the lender and the borrower.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A licensee may retain any security interest in real property on an open-end loan until the open-end account is terminated, provided that if there is no outstanding balance in the account and there is no commitment by the licensee to make advances, the licensee shall within 10 days following written demand by the borrower deliver to the borrower a release of the mortgage or a request for reconveyance of the deed of trust on the real property taken as security.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The repayment provisions of any second mortgage loan shall be clearly set forth in the loan documentation and finance charges shall be clearly disclosed in accordance with RSA 399-B.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to limit any type of mortgage or repayment plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. For second mortgage loans where the payment is applied on the date received, the licensee shall provide to the borrower, at the time of application for the loan, a separate written disclosure which explains how the payments will be applied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Upon payment in full of the outstanding principal, interest, and other charges due on a second mortgage loan, the holder shall plainly mark the note or a copy thereof with the words "PAID IN FULL'' or "CANCELLED'' and release or provide the borrower evidence to release any mortgage or security instrument no longer securing any indebtedness to the holder.  If the original is retained by the lender, the original shall be returned within a reasonable period of time upon the written request of the borrower.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If any note secured by a second mortgage, in the case of loans other than open-end loans, does not among its provisions clearly indicate the principal sums, the rate of interest, the period of the loan and the periodic due dates, if any, of principal and interest or, in the case of open-end loans, if the note does not among its provisions clearly indicate the maximum amount of credit available, the rate of interest, the selected payment, or its manner of determination, and the related period or periods of repayment and the monthly or periodic due dates, then the lender shall have no right to collect interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If any note secured by a second mortgage, in the case of loans other than open-end loans, does not among its provisions clearly indicate the principal sums, the rate of interest, the period of the loan, and the periodic due dates, if any, of principal and interest or, in the case of open-end loans, if the note does not among its provisions clearly indicate the maximum amount of credit available, the rate of interest, the selected payment, or its manner of determination, and the related period or periods of repayment and the monthly or periodic due dates, then the lender shall have no right to collect interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. If the borrower on a second mortgage loan or his or her authorized representative requests, by registered mail, the lender to furnish him or her with a copy of the note, the lender shall, within 15 days after receipt of said request, send by registered mail a true copy of said note to the person requesting the same at the address specified in such request.  At least 15 days prior to the commencement of any foreclosure proceedings the lender shall send to the borrower by registered mail a statement of his or her intention to foreclose which shall specify the amount of principal, interest and other indebtedness, if any, owing and accruing under the note and mortgage.  Failure of the lender to comply with the provisions of this section shall suspend his or her rights until such time as he or she complies with the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Upon payment of any money by the borrower on a second mortgage loan, the lender shall at the request of the borrower give him or her a receipt stating the date of payment, the amount paid, the amount applicable to interest on the loan and the amount applicable to the principal.  Such receipt shall be signed by the lender or the lender's duly authorized representative.  If a lender refuses, on written demand sent by registered mail, to give such receipt, the lender shall forfeit all interest on the principal sum.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Any second mortgage loan made in violation of paragraphs I-VIII by any person shall be discharged upon payment or tender by the debtor or any person succeeding to his or her interest in such real estate of the principal sum actually borrowed.  Any agreement whereby the borrower waives the benefits of paragraphs I-VIII or releases any rights he or she may have acquired by virtue thereof shall be deemed against public policy and void.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 397-A:17 License Revocation;  Suspension. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may issue an order requiring a person to whom any license has been granted or any person under the commissioner's jurisdiction to show cause why the license should not be revoked or suspended, or penalties imposed, or both, for violations of this chapter.  The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license or application pending final determination of any order to show cause, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or licensee that the order has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing.  Valid delivery of such order shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the licensee, or respondent, to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the licensee or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner, after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  The commissioner may by order, upon due notice and opportunity for hearing, assess penalties or deny, suspend, decline to renew, or revoke a license or application and bar any person from licensure if it is in the public interest and the applicant, respondent, or licensee, any partner, officer, member, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, respondent, or licensee:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Has made a false or misleading statement to the commissioner or in any reports to the commissioner;

(g) Has failed to supervise its agents, originators, managers, or employees;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Is permanently, preliminarily, or temporarily enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice involving any aspect of lending or collection activities;

<br>

II. The commissioner may issue orders or directives under this chapter as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Order or direct persons subject to this chapter to cease and desist from conducting business, including immediate temporary orders to cease and desist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Remove or ban from office or employment, including license revocation, any person conducting business under this chapter:

(2) For a violation of federal laws, rules, or regulations;  or
<br>

(3) If the commissioner determines that such person has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor that would preclude licensing under this chapter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If by a preponderance of evidence the commissioner determines that the person no longer demonstrates the financial responsibility, character, and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant a determination that the person subject to the chapter will operate honestly, fairly, and efficiently within the purposes of the chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Deny, suspend, revoke, condition, or decline to renew a license if an applicant or licensee fails at any time to meet the requirements of RSA 397-A:5, IV-c or 397-A:5, IV-d, or withholds information or makes a material misstatement in an application for a license or renewal of a license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the commissioner finds that protection of consumers, lenders, or investors requires emergency action and incorporates a finding to that effect in his or her order, immediate suspension of a license may be ordered pending an adjudicative proceeding.  The adjudicative proceeding shall be commenced not later than 10 business days after the date of the order suspending the license.  Unless expressly waived by the licensee, the commissioner's failure to commence an adjudicative proceeding within 10 business days shall mean that the suspension order is automatically vacated.  The commissioner shall not again suspend the license for the same conduct which formed the basis of the vacated suspension without granting the licensee prior notice and an opportunity for an adjudicative proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The banking department may take action for immediate suspension of a license, pursuant to RSA 541-A:30, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a licensee is a partnership, association, corporation, or entity however organized, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership has so acted or failed to act in behalf of said licensee as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.  Each licensee shall be responsible for supervision of its branch offices and for the acts of any or all of its employees, agents, and originators while acting as its agent if such licensee, after actual knowledge of said acts, retained the benefits, proceeds, profits, or advantages accruing from said acts or otherwise ratified said acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the commissioner finds that any licensee or applicant for license is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a mortgage broker, mortgage banker, or mortgage originator, cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order revoke the license, impose penalties, or deny the application.  The commissioner may deem abandoned and withdraw any application for licensure made pursuant to this chapter, if any applicant fails to respond in writing within 180 calendar days to a written request from the commissioner requesting a response.  Such request shall be sent via certified mail to the last known address of the applicant that is on file with the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. After notice and opportunity for hearing, the commissioner may enter an order of rescission, restitution, or disgorgement of profits directed to a person who has violated this chapter, or a rule or order under this chapter.  Rescission, restitution, or disgorgement of profits shall be in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter or RSA 383:10-d.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the commissioner may assess fines and penalties against a mortgage loan originator in an amount not to exceed $25,000 if the commissioner finds that such loan originator has violated or failed to comply with any requirement of the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, Public Law 110-289, Title V or any regulation or order issued thereunder.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation.
<br>

Every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under this section, every partner, principal executive officer or director of such person, every person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, every employee of such person who materially aids in the act constituting the violation, and every licensee or person acting as a common law agent who materially aids in the acts constituting the violation, either knowingly or negligently, may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, and in addition to any other penalty provided for by law, be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of any registration or license, including the forfeiture of any application fee, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500, or both.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation, and such administrative action or fine may be imposed in addition to any criminal or civil penalties imposed.  No person shall be liable under this paragraph who shall sustain the burden of proof that such person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.

VI. The attorney general on the commissioner's behalf, may, with or without prior administrative action by the commissioner, bring an action against any person in any superior court in this state to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, bar, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted and a receiver may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant's assets.  The court shall not require the commissioner or attorney general to post a bond.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all of the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.  In a proceeding in superior court under this paragraph where the state prevails, the commissioner and the attorney general shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses of investigation, and the court shall include the costs in its final judgment.
