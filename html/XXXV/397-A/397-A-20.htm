Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate offense and a prosecution or conviction for any one of such offenses shall not bar prosecution or conviction of any other offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this chapter, rule, or order of the commissioner may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, except where another penalty is expressly provided, be subject to suspension or revocation of any registration or license, or imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500 for each violation in lieu of or in addition to suspension or revocation, as may be applicable under this title, for violation of the provision to which such rule or order relates.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who negligently violates any provision of this chapter, rule, or order of the commissioner may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, except where another penalty is expressly provided, be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of any registration or license, including the forfeiture of any application fee, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $1,500 for each violation, in lieu of or in addition to suspension or revocation, as may be applicable under this title, for violation of the provision to which such rule or order relates.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation.

IV. Every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under this section, every partner, principal executive officer or director of such person, every person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, every employee of such person who materially aids in the act constituting the violation, and every licensee or person acting as a common law agent who materially aids in the acts constituting the violation, either knowingly or negligently, may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, and in addition to any other penalty provided for by law, be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of any registration or license, including the forfeiture of any application fee, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500, or both.

The attorney general on the commissioner's behalf, may, with or without prior administrative action by the commissioner, bring an action against any person in any superior court in this state to enjoin the acts or practices of such person and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, bar, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted and a receiver may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant's assets.  The court shall not require the commissioner or attorney general to post a bond.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all of the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.

(b) Any actual damages suffered by the mortgagor as a result of such violation, including, but not limited to, late payment penalties and associated interest, and any amount which would have been paid by an insurer for a casualty or liability claim had the insurance policy not been canceled for nonpayment by the mortgage servicing company;  and
