I-a. Any person who willfully violates any provisions of RSA 397-A:2, VI or VII or a cease and desist order or injunction issued pursuant to RSA 397-A:18, II shall be guilty of a class B felony.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate offense and a prosecution or conviction for any one of such offenses shall not bar prosecution or conviction of any other offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who knowingly violates any rule or order of the commissioner may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, except where another penalty is expressly provided, be subject to suspension or revocation of any registration or license, or imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500 for each violation in lieu of or in addition to suspension or revocation, as may be applicable under this title, for violation of the provision to which such rule or order relates.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who negligently violates any rule or order of the commissioner may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, except where another penalty is expressly provided, be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of any registration or license, including the forfeiture of any application fee, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $1,500 for each violation, in lieu of or in addition to suspension or revocation, as may be applicable under this title, for violation of the provision to which such rule or order relates.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person who, either knowingly or negligently, violates any provision of this chapter may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, and in addition to any such other penalty provided for by law, be subject to suspension, revocation or denial of any registration or license, including forfeiture of any application fee, or an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500, or both.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation, and each such administrative action or fine may be imposed in addition to any criminal or civil penalties imposed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under this section, every partner, principal executive officer or director of such person, every person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, every employee of such person who materially aids in the act constituting the violation, and every licensee or person acting as a common law agent who materially aids in the acts constituting the violation, either knowingly or negligently, may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, and in addition to any other penalty provided for by law, be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of any registration or license, including the forfeiture of any application fee, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500, or both.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation, and such administrative action or fine may be imposed in addition to any criminal or civil penalties imposed.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The attorney general on the commissioner's behalf, may, with or without prior administrative action by the commissioner, bring an action against any person in any superior court in this state to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, bar, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted and a receiver may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant's assets.  The court shall not require the commissioner or attorney general to post a bond.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all of the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.  In a proceeding in superior court under this paragraph where the state prevails, the commissioner and the attorney general shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses of investigation, and the court shall include the costs in its final judgment.
