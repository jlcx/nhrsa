<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be unlawful for any person who is not exempt under RSA 397-A:4, to act as a mortgage broker, mortgage banker, or mortgage originator in its, his, or her name or on behalf of another person without first obtaining and maintaining annually a license under this chapter.  Each mortgage banker, broker, or originator shall register with and obtain and maintain a valid unique identifier issued by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.  Under this chapter, an originator's license is only in effect when such originator is employed or retained by a licensed mortgage banker, broker, or a registered servicer or by a person exempt from this chapter that has registered or made a filing as an exempt entity on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System.  A person licensed as mortgage banker may act as a mortgage broker without obtaining a separate license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A person located outside of the United States and required to be licensed under this chapter shall maintain a location within the continental United States where records of all New Hampshire transactions are kept and from where all activity under this chapter shall be conducted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. A loan processor or underwriter who is an independent contractor may not engage in the activities of a loan processor or underwriter unless such independent contractor loan processor or underwriter obtains and maintains a license.  Each independent contractor loan processor or underwriter licensed as a mortgage loan originator must have and maintain a valid unique identifier issued by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is unlawful for any mortgage banker or mortgage broker to employ, retain, or otherwise engage an originator unless the originator is licensed.  No originator shall at any time represent more than one mortgage banker or mortgage broker.  Before an individual begins activities that require licensure as an originator in this state, the originator and the mortgage banker or mortgage broker who employs or retains the originator shall file an application with the commissioner to license the originator in this state.  When an individual ceases to be employed or retained as an originator by a mortgage banker or mortgage broker, the originator's license shall terminate and the mortgage banker or mortgage broker shall notify the commissioner within 15 calendar days.  If the mortgage banker or mortgage broker ceases to be licensed under this chapter for any reason, the licenses of originators employed or retained by the mortgage banker or mortgage broker shall terminate unless an originator's license is suspended, revoked or transferred to another licensed mortgage banker or mortgage broker.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A branch office of a mortgage banker or mortgage broker shall be licensed prior to conducting business at such location.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Governmental entities and exempt nonprofit entities may not be required to obtain a mortgage banker or mortgage broker license when such entity:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Is authorized to conduct mortgage banker or mortgage broker business in this state by an order of the commissioner or is authorized by New Hampshire statute to do mortgage lending;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Files as an exempt entity on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry;
