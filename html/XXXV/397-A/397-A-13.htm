&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

A mortgage banker's financial statement shall include a balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in owners' equity, and a cash flow statement.  A mortgage broker's financial statement shall include a balance sheet or a statement of net worth.  If the financial statement filed under this section is not audited, a certification statement shall be attached and signed by a duly authorized officer of the licensee.
