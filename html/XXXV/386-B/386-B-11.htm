<codesect>
The bank commissioner may require such reports from and make such examinations of each mutual holding company as he deems necessary to determine the true condition of the subsidiaries and affiliates thereof over which he has general supervision, the ability of such subsidiaries and affiliates to perform their engagements, and the inter-company relationship of the mutual holding company and such subsidiaries and affiliates.  The cost of such examinations shall be assessed against, and paid by, such mutual holding company.  Mutual holding companies shall furnish the commissioner with copies of the reports filed by them with their federal supervisory authorities, and the bank commissioner shall, as far as possible, rely upon such reports for the purposes of this section.
