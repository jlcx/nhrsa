&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 383-A:3-305 Application. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The organizer of a state bank shall apply for a charter by filing an application under RSA 383-A:6-602.  The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the application.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) The commissioner shall review the application, and, within 30 days of its receipt, determine if it is substantially complete.  An application is complete if it contains all the information required in subsection (a) and RSA 383-A:3-304, the organizer has paid the application fee, and the application meets all other requirements as the commissioner may prescribe by rule.  If the application is deemed to be incomplete, then the commissioner shall notify the organizer, and the organizer shall have 30 days to provide the required information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the commissioner determines that the application is substantially complete under subsection (b)(1), then he or she shall so notify the organizer, and, within 30 days, the organizer shall cause a public notice of the application to be published in a newspaper of general circulation or other media acceptable to the commissioner.  The form of public notice shall be prescribed by the commissioner.  The notice shall state a date before which objections may be filed, which date shall not be earlier than 14 days after the publication of the notice.  Within the time specified, any interested person may file with the commissioner a statement of objection to the granting of the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At any time after being submitted, the commissioner may deem the application to be abandoned if the organizer fails to furnish required information and certifications or the required fee within 30 days after a request made by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the commissioner determines that the application is substantially complete, then he or she shall promptly conduct an examination of all relevant facts connected with the organization of the state bank.  The commissioner may examine the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Whether the proposed organizational structure is adequate to manage the proposed state bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Whether the proposed capital as set forth in the capital plan is adequate in relation to the proposed business of the proposed state bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Whether the business plan sets forth a reasonable basis to indicate a reasonable probability of success and profitability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Whether the proposed executive officers and directors collectively, have sufficient experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the proposed state bank will be free from improper or unlawful influence and otherwise will operate in compliance with law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Whether the proposed name of the proposed state bank is likely to mislead the public as to its character or purpose or is the same as a name already adopted by an existing state bank in this state or so similar to a name already in use by a bank or another entity as to be likely to mislead the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Any other factor relevant to the type of state bank being proposed, as the commissioner may determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e)(1) The commissioner may require a background investigation and criminal history records check on any one or more of the organizer, directors, and executive officers.  The commissioner may also require a background investigation and criminal history records check on any natural person who directly or indirectly, or with a group of persons acting in concert, has the right to vote 10 percent or more of voting interests or owns 10 percent or more of the beneficial interests in the proposed state bank.  The commissioner may also require financial and other information from any entity that on its own or collectively with its directors, executive officers, and other persons, holds 10 percent or more of the voting interests or 10 percent or more of the beneficial interests in the proposed state bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For purposes of this subsection, the following groups of persons shall be presumed to be acting in concert:  (i) an entity and any shareholder, member, partner, trustee, or executive officer of the entity, if both the entity and the person hold directly or indirectly voting interests or beneficial interests in the proposed state bank, (ii) a person and the person's immediate family which hold directly or indirectly voting interests or beneficial interests in the proposed state bank;  or (iii) entities under common control of those persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If required by the commissioner, the persons described in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) shall submit to the department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire department of safety, division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any, and a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the department.  If the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, then a second set of fingerprints may be necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, then, in lieu of the criminal history records check, the department may accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The commissioner shall submit the criminal history records release form to the division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.  The department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received under this subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Officers'' means the person or persons designated by the board of directors of a depository bank or credit union to act for the depository bank or credit union in carrying out the provisions of this chapter or, in the absence of any designation or of the officer or officers so designated, the president or any other officer currently in charge of the state bank or credit union or of the office or offices in question.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Office'' means any place at which a depository bank or credit union transacts its business or conducts operations related to its business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Emergency'' means any condition or occurrence which may interfere physically with the conduct of normal business operations at one or more or all of the offices of a depository bank or credit union, or which poses an imminent or existing threat to the safety or security of persons or property, or both.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an emergency may arise as a result of any one or more of the following:  fire, flood, earthquake, hurricanes, wind, rain, or snow storms, labor disputes and strikes, power failures, transportation failures, interruption of communication facilities, shortages of fuel, housing, food, transportation or labor, robbery or attempted robbery, actual or threatened enemy attack, epidemics or other catastrophes, riots, civil commotions, and other acts of lawlessness or violence, actual or threatened.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) By proclamation, the commissioner may close all of the offices of all depository banks or credit unions on any day or days designated in the proclamation, by proclamation of the president of the United States or the governor of this state, as a day or days of mourning, rejoicing, or other special observance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whenever the officers of a depository bank or credit union are of the opinion that an emergency exists, or is impending, which affects, or may affect, one or more or all of a depository bank's or credit union's offices, they may, in the reasonable and proper exercise of their discretion, determine not to open any one or more or all of the offices on any business or banking day or, if having opened, to close any one or more or all of the offices during the continuation of the emergency.  The office or offices so closed shall remain closed until such time as the officers determine that the emergency has ended and for such further time thereafter as may reasonably be required to reopen;  however, in no case shall the office or offices remain closed for more than 48 consecutive hours, excluding other legal holidays, without requesting the approval of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any day on which a depository bank or credit union, or any one or more of its offices, is closed during all or any part of its normal banking hours under the authorization granted under this chapter shall be, with respect to the depository bank or credit union or, if not all of its offices are closed, then with respect to any office or offices which are closed, a legal holiday for all purposes with respect to any banking business of any character.  No liability, or loss of rights of any kind, on the part of any depository bank or credit union, or any of its directors, officers, or employees, shall accrue or result by virtue of any closing authorized by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The provisions of this section shall be construed and applied as being in addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other law of this state or of the United States, authorizing the closing of a state bank or credit union or excusing the delay by a depository bank or credit union in the performance of its duties and obligations because of emergencies or conditions beyond the depository bank or credit union's control, or otherwise.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the commissioner finds that the violation or practice set forth in subsection (a) requires immediate action for the protection of depositors or the public, or where the violation or practice, or the continuation of the violation or practice, is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of the assets, capital or earnings of a state bank or credit union, then the commissioner may issue orders under subsection (a) which shall become effective upon service of those orders, without prior notice or hearing.  Upon entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the person (i) that the order has been entered, (ii) the reasons for the order, and (iii) that within 10 calendar days the matter will be scheduled for a hearing unless the time period is waived by the person subject to the order.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, or the person fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, then the person shall be deemed in default, and, on the thirty-first day, the order shall become permanent and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.

In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding a temporary or permanent injunction, and awarding the commissioner or the attorney general or both costs in bringing such action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A person who is subject to an order of the commissioner shall not have any civil or criminal liability in an action brought by the state for any act or omission made in good faith in reliance upon that order, even if a subsequent decision of any court invalidates that order.
