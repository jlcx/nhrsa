<codesect>
(a) The commissioner shall examine each notice or application filed under RSA 383-A:6-602 to determine whether it complies with applicable filing requirements, including payment of any required fee.  No later than 30 days after receipt of the filing by the commissioner, the notice or application shall be deemed substantially complete unless the commissioner notifies the filer within the 30-day period that it is not substantially complete or requests the person to submit additional information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The filer may re-file the notice or application with required modifications or submissions.  If the re-filing is made within 90 days after receipt of commissioner's notice, then the initial filing fee shall cover the re-filing, and no additional filing fee shall be required to be paid.  If the re-filing is made after the expiration of the 90-day period, then a new fee must be paid.  The commissioner shall then determine whether the re-filed notice or application is substantially complete within 30 days after receipt of the re-filing and shall so notify the person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A notice or application deemed substantially complete under this section shall be subject to final determination by the commissioner under RSA 383-A:6-604.
