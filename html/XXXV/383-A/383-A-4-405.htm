<codesect>
(a) A state bank or credit union shall maintain a fidelity bond that provides protection against losses from (i) any dishonest or criminal act of any person, including any of its directors, officers, employees, and agents, and (ii) any act such as robbery, burglary, or forgery by a person not associated with the bank.  The board of directors shall review the fidelity bond annually, or more often as circumstances require, to evaluate the adequacy of the amount of coverage.  A bank or credit union shall give notice to the commissioner if the coverage is decreased by 25 percent or more under RSA 383-A:6-602.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) From time to time, the commissioner may reduce or increase the amount of the fidelity bond that a state bank or credit union is required to maintain.  At no time shall the amount fall below the minimum required by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policy shall require that the fidelity insurer notify the commissioner within 10 days after the cancellation or nonrenewal of the fidelity bond.
