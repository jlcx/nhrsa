<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of effectuating the depositor ratification procedures required by this paragraph, the commissioner is directed to adopt depositor voting procedures, applying to the same extent and with comparable limitations as federal savings and loan associations operating within this state are permitted under rules of the Office of Thrift Supervision, or any successor thereto.  The rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall contain a provision allowing for the inclusion of comments on the conversion by individual corporators and groups of corporators with the voting materials submitted to the depositors.
