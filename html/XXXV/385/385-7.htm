<codesect>
When a safe deposit box is rented to a person, and such renter appoints a deputy on the records of the lessor by written power of attorney expressly providing that the deputy shall have a continued right of access to the box after the death of the renter, and the renter dies survived by such deputy, then, notwithstanding any rule of law to the effect that a power of attorney is terminated by the death of the principal, such surviving deputy shall have a right of access to such box for any purpose;  and the lessor of the box shall be protected against the heirs, assigns, executors and administrators of such deceased renter in recognizing such right.
