&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary including RSA 387:5, III-c, any lending institution may treat manufactured housing the same as realty for the purposes of securing loans for the financing of such housing.  When a lending institution does treat manufactured housing as realty, no certificate of title shall be required under RSA 261:1 et seq.;  however, all of the provisions with regard to conveyances, deeds, foreclosure and any other provisions of law applicable to mortgages of realty shall apply to manufactured housing, including the provisions of RSA 387:4 and RSA 393:15 and 15-a which are applicable to realty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section and RSA 393:18-b, "manufactured housing'' shall mean any and all forms of modular, unitized or prefabricated housing, as well as mobile homes which are brought to and assembled on a building site, placed on a foundation or slab and hooked up to all conventional and necessary utility systems and which are intended to be used as a permanent dwelling unit.  "Manufactured housing'' does not include housing or mobile homes which are fully constructed on the site.
