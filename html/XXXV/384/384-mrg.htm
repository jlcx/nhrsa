&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 384:6 Removal by Bank Commissioner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Whenever, in the opinion of the bank commissioner, any officer, trustee, or director of a financial institution shall have continued to violate any law relative thereto, or shall have continued unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of said financial institution, after having been warned in writing by the commissioner to discontinue such violations of law or such unsafe or unsound practices, he may cause notice to be served upon such officer, trustee, or director to appear before him to show cause why he should not be removed from office.  A copy of such order shall be sent by registered mail to each trustee or director of the financial institution affected.  If, after granting such officer, trustee, or director a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the commissioner finds that he has continued to so violate the law, or has continued unsafe or unsound practices after having been warned, the commissioner may, with the approval of 2 persons of good standing in the banking business, to be named by the governor upon the request of the bank commissioner, order that such officer, director, or trustee be removed from office.  A copy of such order shall be served upon such officer, trustee, or director and upon the financial institution of which he is an officer, trustee, or director whereupon he shall cease to be an officer, trustee, or director of such financial institution.  Provided that such order and the findings of fact upon which it is based shall not be made public or disclosed to any one except the officer, trustee, or director involved and the trustees or directors of the financial institution affected, otherwise than in connection with proceedings for a violation of this section.  No such officer, trustee, or director removed from office as herein provided shall, without the consent of the bank commissioner, participate in any manner in the management or operation of said financial institution.  Any person so removed from office may, with the approval of the trustees or directors of the financial institution affected expressed by majority vote in which he shall not participate, appeal by petition to the supreme court within 30 days from the date of the order of removal.  Upon hearing, after such notice as the court may order, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner to show that the order of removal is clearly unreasonable or unlawful, and all findings of the bank commissioner upon all questions of fact properly before him shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable and the order shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law unless the court by a clear preponderance of the evidence before it finds that such order is unjust or unreasonable.  Pending decision of the supreme court, the order of removal shall continue in effect.

Unless the charter or bylaws provide otherwise, a board of directors or trustees may permit any or all directors or trustees to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all of the directors or trustees participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting.  A director or trustee participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.  However, a director or trustee shall be physically present at a majority of the meetings such director or trustee attends.  If any member of the board of directors of a nondepository trust company resides outside of the state of New Hampshire, the board may permit such out-of-state director to be physically present at a lesser number of meetings, if such arrangement is approved in writing by the bank commissioner, based upon a finding that the safety and soundness of such financial institution will not be impaired by such less frequent physical presence.

No merger shall be permitted which will result in a violation of the deposit limitation contained in RSA 384-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The exercise of the authority contained in paragraph I of this section by any out-of-state bank which is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision shall be subject to a determination by the bank commissioner that the laws of the state in which the bank is chartered, and if it is part of a bank holding company the laws of each state in which a banking subsidiary of the out-of-state bank holding company is located, would permit a substantially similar transaction to occur.

I. The commissioner is hereby authorized to examine New Hampshire branches of out-of-state banks.  The commissioner may, as an adjunct to such authority, enter into agreements with out-of-state state bank regulatory agencies or federal bank regulatory agencies or both to examine or participate in the examination of New Hampshire offices or out-of-state offices of out-of-state banks and out-of-state bank holding companies.  Notwithstanding RSA 98-B:5, or any other provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner is authorized to permit one or more banking department employees to travel outside the state of New Hampshire for purposes of conducting or participating in the examination of such out-of-state bank or bank holding company without the necessity of obtaining the separate consent of the governor and executive council for such out-of-state travel.  The commissioner is further authorized to enter into agreements with out-of-state state and federal bank regulatory agencies for purposes of sharing and protecting the confidentiality of any New Hampshire banking department examination report, workpapers or other examination information and the examination report, workpapers or other examination information of the out-of-state state or federal bank regulatory agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The cost of any examination conducted pursuant to paragraph I shall be the same as that provided by RSA 383:11, I, except that the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals and other expenses of examination personnel employed in making examinations pursuant to the provisions of paragraph I shall be chargeable to the out-of-state bank or out-of-state bank holding company examined and shall be paid by such institution in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Neither the commissioner nor any employee affected hereby shall be required or compelled, as a condition of continued employment or otherwise, to consent to such flexible or alternative work schedule.  The commissioner shall be entitled to establish policies that set forth the number of hours in each work day and the days of the week that constitute work days, or other conditions applicable to flexible and alternative work schedules, and any such flexible or alternative work schedule agreements entered into between the commissioner and examiners shall be subject to such policies.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subdivision, an out-of-state bank, which is permitted by the federal or state regulatory authority that issued its charter to exercise trust powers either through a trust department or as a limited purpose institution organized for the sole purpose of conducting trust activities, may exercise trust powers in New Hampshire in the same manner as is authorized for a New Hampshire bank under RSA 390:13, and may establish one or more places of business in this state for the conduct of trust activities, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The out-of-state bank is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a bank holding company that has a direct or indirect bank subsidiary that has an office in this state at which deposits are accepted;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The law of the state in which the main office of the out-of-state bank is located would allow a New Hampshire bank to establish one or more places of business in such state for the conduct of trust activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. As a condition precedent to the right of an out-of-state bank to act in the capacities specified in paragraph I, the out-of-state bank shall file a stipulation with the department of revenue administration, in which it shall agree that any funds, securities, or property held by it under any appointment under this section shall be taxed in the same manner and to the same extent as funds of the same character held by a New Hampshire bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An out-of-state bank seeking to act in the capacities specified in paragraph I shall apply to the bank commissioner for approval to establish a place of business in this state pursuant to this section.  The out-of-state bank shall pay the same application fee to establish a place or places of business in this state as a New Hampshire bank would pay under RSA 384-B:2 to establish a branch or branches in this state.  The bank commissioner may conduct a public hearing on the application of the out-of-state bank.  If the bank commissioner finds that the out-of-state bank is adequately staffed, equipped, and able to furnish trust services in accordance with applicable laws regulating the activities of fiduciaries in this state, the bank commissioner shall approve the application in writing with such conditions as the bank commissioner deems appropriate.  The bank commissioner may examine the trust activities of the out-of-state bank any time the bank commissioner deems necessary to ensure its continued safety and soundness, ability to furnish trust services, and compliance with the laws of this state.  The out-of-state bank shall make its books and records pertaining to its trust activities in this state available to the bank commissioner for such examination and shall pay the same cost for such examination as is assessed to New Hampshire banks for similar examinations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A New Hampshire bank is authorized to conduct trust activities in any other state and to establish a place or places of business in any other state for the purpose of conducting trust activities, in accordance with the laws of such other state.  A New Hampshire bank shall apply to the bank commissioner for approval to establish a place or places of business in any other state pursuant to this section.  The New Hampshire bank shall pay the same application fee to establish a place or places of business in such other state as a New Hampshire bank would pay under RSA 384-B:2 to establish a branch or branches in this state.  The bank commissioner may conduct a public hearing on the application of the New Hampshire bank.  If the bank commissioner finds that the New Hampshire bank is adequately staffed, equipped, and able to furnish trust services in accordance with applicable laws regulating the activities of fiduciaries in such other state, the bank commissioner shall approve the application in writing with such conditions as the bank commissioner deems appropriate.  The bank commissioner may examine the out-of-state trust activities of the New Hampshire bank at any time the commissioner deems necessary to ensure its continued safety and soundness, ability to furnish trust services, and compliance with the laws of such other state or states.  The New Hampshire bank shall make its books and records pertaining to its trust activities in any other state available to the bank commissioner for such examination and shall pay for the cost of such examination.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, and in addition to any authority granted by RSA 564-B, any bank, as defined in RSA 384:57, II, authorized to exercise trust powers in this state, is authorized while acting as a fiduciary to purchase for the fiduciary estate, directly from underwriters or distributors or in the secondary market:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Bonds or other securities underwritten or distributed by such bank or an affiliate thereof or by a syndicate which includes such bank or affiliate, provided that such bank discloses in any written communication or account statement reflecting the purchase of such bonds or securities the nature of the interest of such bank or affiliate in the underwriting or distribution of such bonds and securities and whether such bank or affiliate received any fee in connection with such purchase;  and
<br>

(b) Be compensated by the investment company, investment trust, or other company for providing services in a capacity other than as trustee, such as advisor, distributor, transfer agent, registrar, sponsor, manager, shareholder servicing agent, administrator, or custodian, if the fiduciary at least annually notifies each person to whom it is required to send account statements under RSA 564-B:8-813 of the rate and method by which the compensation was determined.
