A family trust company may voluntarily dissolve in the manner provided in this chapter.  Such dissolution may be accomplished by the liquidation of the family trust company or by reorganizing the family trust company into a domestic or foreign corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership that does not have banking or trust powers, and in both instances surrendering its family trust company charter to the bank commissioner.
