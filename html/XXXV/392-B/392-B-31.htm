Not later than 30 days thereafter, the bank commissioner shall either approve or not approve the application.  If the bank commissioner approves the application, then the applicant may proceed with the dissolution under the plan, subject to such conditions that the bank commissioner may prescribe.  If the applicant subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution must be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the bank commissioner and obtain his or her approval to proceed under the amended plan.  If the bank commissioner does not approve the application or amended plan, if any, the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to RSA 541.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and conditions, if any, prescribed by the bank commissioner, necessary to liquidate the family trust company or to effect the reorganization, the applicant shall submit a written report of its actions to the bank commissioner and the applicant's board of directors shall certify, under oath, that it is true and correct.  Following receipt of the report, the bank commissioner may examine the family trust company to determine whether the bank commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken to liquidate or reorganize the family trust company in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the bank commissioner.  The cost of the examination shall be paid by the applicant.  Not later than 60 days after the filing of the report, the bank commissioner shall examine the report and the bank commissioner's findings, and, if it is satisfied, shall so notify the applicant in writing that the dissolution has been completed and is final.  Thereupon, the applicant shall surrender its charter to the bank commissioner, and the bank commissioner shall issue a certificate of dissolution to be filed with the secretary of state pursuant to RSA 392-B:32.
