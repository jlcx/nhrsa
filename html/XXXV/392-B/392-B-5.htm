&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-B:5 Petition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Said organizers may file a petition requesting that the bank commissioner grant a charter for a family trust company.  Such petition shall be made in the form prescribed by the bank commissioner, together with all other information required by the bank commissioner to be submitted with the petition, and shall be signed by the organizer or organizers, as the case may be.  The petition shall state that the family trust company or proposed family trust company will not transact business with the general public without the approval of the bank commissioner and shall state the name of the designated representative whose relationship to other individuals determines whether the individuals are family members under RSA 392-B:1, IV.  An examination fee of $10,000 shall be paid when the petition is filed.  Sums collected under this section shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the bank commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a family trust company shall be subject to the provisions of Title 35 in the same manner and to the same extent as a nondepository trust company, unless expressly exempted by the bank commissioner pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A family trust company or proposed family trust company may request in writing, in the form required by the bank commissioner, that it be exempted from any provision of Title 35.  The bank commissioner may grant or deny the exemption request in whole or in part.  The bank commissioner also may issue rules, orders, or declaratory rulings granting exemptions to all family trust companies, or to family trust companies that meet specified conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The bank commissioner may examine or investigate the family trust company or proposed family trust company in connection with the request for exemption.  Unless the application presents novel or unusual questions, the bank commissioner shall approve or deny the application for exemption no later than the 61st day after the date the bank commissioner considers the petition complete and accepted for filing.  The bank commissioner may require the submission of additional information in order to make an informed decision to approve or reject the proposed exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any exemption granted under the provisions of this section may be made subject to conditions or limitations imposed by the bank commissioner consistent with this chapter, and those conditions or limitations shall be included in an order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Rules, orders, or declaratory rulings of the bank commissioner may provide for other circumstances that justify exemption from any of the specified provisions of Title 35, specifying the provisions that are subject to the exemption request, and establishing procedures and requirements for obtaining, maintaining, or revoking exemptions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The bank commissioner may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the person or group of persons acting in concert who propose to acquire or hold directly or indirectly 10 percent or more of the beneficial ownership or control of the family trust company, new officers and directors and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  If any such person is a subsidiary of another company, the banking department may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the individuals who are the indirect owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If required by the bank commissioner, the persons described in subparagraph (a) shall submit to the banking department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints shall be necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the banking department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The bank commissioner shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the banking department.  The banking department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The bank commissioner may require the incorporators to pay the actual costs of each background investigation and criminal history records check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The bank commissioner may make further inquiry and investigation as the bank commissioner deems appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon receipt of a petition deemed to be complete by the bank commissioner, the bank commissioner shall promptly conduct an examination of all relevant facts connected with the formation of the proposed family trust company.  The bank commissioner may examine the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whether the proposed organizational and capital structure and the amount of initial capital appear adequate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whether the proposed officers and directors or managers, as a group, have sufficient experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the proposed family trust company will be free from improper or unlawful influence and otherwise will operate in compliance with law, and that success of the proposed family trust company is reasonably probable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the proposed name of the proposed family trust company is likely to mislead the public as to its character or purpose or is the same as a name already adopted by an existing bank, savings association, or trust institution in this state, or so similar thereto as to be likely to mislead the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any other factor, as the bank commissioner may deem appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The bank commissioner may make further inquiry and investigation as the bank commissioner deems appropriate.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, information bearing on actual or proposed accounts of the family trust company or proposed family trust company applying for the exemption or the identity or residence address of the designated relative or any other family member shall be confidential and not subject to public disclosure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The failure of a petitioner to furnish required information, data, other material, or the required fee within 30 days after a request may be considered an abandonment of the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any application not deemed complete may be rejected by the bank commissioner.  A rejected application may be refiled with the bank commissioner upon such form and in such manner as prescribed by the bank commissioner and a refiling fee of $10,000 shall be paid.
