<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI. The initial capital required to organize a family trust company shall be not less than $250,000.  The bank commissioner may require, in the exercise of his or her discretion based on safety and soundness factors, as set forth in paragraph IV, additional capital at such levels as he or she determines is necessary to protect against the risks inherent in the business of the family trust company.  Once organized, a family trust company shall maintain a minimum level of capital required by the bank commissioner to operate in a safe and sound manner based upon his or her examination of the company, provided that the level of capital shall not be less than $250,000.  The bank commissioner may, by rule, order, or declaratory ruling set liquidity requirements for such capital.  The bank commissioner may require any family trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary to comply with reasonable trust standards, as applicable, not inconsistent with law.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. A family trust company shall pledge to the bank commissioner securities or a surety bond for the benefit of the bank commissioner to defray the costs of a liquidation of the family trust company by the bank commissioner in the event it should fail.  The amount of the securities or the surety bond shall be determined by the bank commissioner in an amount that he or she deems appropriate to defray such costs, but in no event shall such amount exceed $1,250,000 initially or if the family trust company has a rating from the bank commissioner of a one or 2.  If a family trust company has a rating from the bank commissioner of 3 or lower, then the amount of the securities or the surety bond shall be increased to $3,000,000 and the family trust company shall satisfy such increase within 14 calendar days of receipt of written notice from the bank commissioner.  In the event of a receivership of a family trust company, the bank commissioner may, without regard to any priorities, preferences, or adverse claims, reduce the pledged securities or the surety bond to cash and, as soon as practicable, utilize the cash to defray the costs associated with the receivership.  If the family trust company chooses to pledge securities to satisfy this provision, the securities shall be held at a depository institution or a Federal Reserve Bank approved by the bank commissioner.  The bank commissioner may specify the types of securities that may be pledged.  Any fees associated with holding such securities shall be the responsibility of the family trust company.  If the family trust company chooses to purchase a surety bond to satisfy this provision, the surety bond shall be issued by a bonding company, approved by the bank commissioner, that is authorized to do business in this state and that has a rating in one of the 3 highest grades as determined by a national rating service.  The surety bond shall be in a form approved by the bank commissioner.  The family trust company may not obtain a surety bond from any entity in which the family trust company has a financial interest.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The safety and soundness factors to be considered by the bank commissioner in the exercise of his or her discretion include:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) The nature and type of business proposed to be conducted.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) The nature and liquidity of assets proposed to be held in its own account.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) The amount of fiduciary assets projected to be under management.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) The type of fiduciary assets proposed to be held and the proposed depository of the assets.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) The complexity of fiduciary duties and degree of discretion proposed to be undertaken.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(f) The competence and experience of proposed management.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(g) The extent and adequacy of proposed internal controls.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(h) The proposed presence or absence of annual unqualified audits by an independent certified public accountant.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(i) The reasonableness of business plans for retaining or acquiring additional equity capital.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(j) The existence and adequacy of insurance proposed to be obtained by the family trust company for the purpose of protecting its clients, beneficiaries, and grantors.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. Based on the factors in paragraph III, the bank commissioner may require any family trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary for its safe and sound operation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, a family trust company may invest its funds for its own account in any type or character of equity securities or debt securities subject to the limitations provided by this section, which investments shall otherwise comply with the prudent investor standard described in RSA 564-B:9-902.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. Subject to paragraphs VII and VIII, the total investment in equity and investment securities of any one issuer, obligor, or maker held by a family trust company for its own account shall not exceed an amount equal to 15 percent of the family trust company's equity capital.  The bank commissioner may authorize investments in excess of this limitation if the bank commissioner concludes that the safe and sound operation of a family trust company would not be adversely affected by a proposed investment exceeding this limitation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. In calculating compliance with the investment limits set forth in paragraph VI, a family trust company shall not be required to combine:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) The family trust company's pro rata share of the securities of an issuer in the portfolio of a collective investment vehicle with the family trust company's pro rata share of the securities of that issuer held by another collective investment vehicle in which the family trust company has invested;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) The family trust company's own direct investment in the securities of an issuer with the family trust company's pro rata share of the securities of that issuer held by collective investment vehicles in which the family trust company has invested under the provisions of this section.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. Notwithstanding paragraph VI, a family trust company may purchase for its own account, without limitation and subject only to the exercise of prudent judgment:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Bonds and other general obligations of a state, an agency, or political subdivision of a state, the United States, or an agency or instrumentality of the United States.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) A debt security that this state, an agency or political subdivision of this state, the United States, or an agency or instrumentality of the United States has unconditionally agreed to purchase, insure, or guarantee.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Securities that are offered and sold under 15 U.S.C. section 77d(5).<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) Mortgage-related securities as defined in 15 U.S.C. section 78c(a).<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) Investment securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Fannie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Association, or the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation;  and<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(f) Investment securities issued or guaranteed by the North American Development Bank.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIX.
