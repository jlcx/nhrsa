&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In deciding whether or not to grant the petition, the bank commissioner shall consider the information set forth in RSA 392-B:5, IV.  Upon reaching his or her decision, the bank commissioner shall make a record thereof.  If the petition is denied, it shall be dismissed and no new petition concerning the same company shall be filed within one year thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the bank commissioner determines that the petition does not meet the requirements of RSA 392-B:5, IV by the exercise proposed by the family trust company of all the powers and privileges which are included in the petition, but that the same would be satisfied by the exercise of a part thereof, he or she shall notify the petitioners;  and in such case, the petitioners may have leave to withdraw, and may at once file another petition setting forth new organizational documents, upon which the same procedure shall be conducted as upon the original petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A petition of the organizers for a charter for the proposed family trust company shall be exempt from any notice, objection, or hearing requirements otherwise applicable to nondepository trust companies.
