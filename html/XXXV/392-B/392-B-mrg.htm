&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-B:3 Limited Liability Company. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding RSA 304-C:21, I, or any other provision of law to the contrary, a family trust company subject to the regulation of the bank commissioner may be organized as a limited liability company with all the powers and privileges and subject to all the duties, restrictions, and liabilities of a corporate family trust company.  A family trust company organized as a limited liability company shall have all the powers and privileges and, except as otherwise provided in this section, be subject to all the duties, restrictions, and liabilities of state laws applicable to a limited liability company.  A family trust company organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to all of the same laws and regulations that relate to a family trust company organized as a corporation.  All managers and employees of a family trust company organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to the same duties and liabilities as pertain to directors, trustees, and employees of a family trust company organized as a corporation.  Any reference to corporations, directors, officers, stockholders, or other like terms used to describe corporations in the statutes governing family trust company shall be construed to apply in the same manner to limited liability companies, managers, employees, members, or other like terms used to describe limited liability companies unless the context otherwise requires.  The organizational instrument of a family trust company chartered as a limited liability company shall provide that its existence shall be perpetual, that the company shall be managed by managers, that no member of the company shall be individually liable for the debts of the company, other than to the extent of the member's investment therein, and that any limitation on transferability of ownership interests shall exclude any transfer required by lawful order of the bank commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-B:5 Petition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Said organizers may file a petition requesting that the bank commissioner grant a charter for a family trust company.  Such petition shall be made in the form prescribed by the bank commissioner, together with all other information required by the bank commissioner to be submitted with the petition, and shall be signed by the organizer or organizers, as the case may be.  The petition shall state that the family trust company or proposed family trust company will not transact business with the general public without the approval of the bank commissioner and shall state the name of the designated representative whose relationship to other individuals determines whether the individuals are family members under RSA 392-B:1, IV.  An examination fee of $10,000 shall be paid when the petition is filed.  Sums collected under this section shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the bank commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a family trust company shall be subject to the provisions of Title 35 in the same manner and to the same extent as a nondepository trust company, unless expressly exempted by the bank commissioner pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A family trust company or proposed family trust company may request in writing, in the form required by the bank commissioner, that it be exempted from any provision of Title 35.  The bank commissioner may grant or deny the exemption request in whole or in part.  The bank commissioner also may issue rules, orders, or declaratory rulings granting exemptions to all family trust companies, or to family trust companies that meet specified conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The bank commissioner may examine or investigate the family trust company or proposed family trust company in connection with the request for exemption.  Unless the application presents novel or unusual questions, the bank commissioner shall approve or deny the application for exemption no later than the 61st day after the date the bank commissioner considers the petition complete and accepted for filing.  The bank commissioner may require the submission of additional information in order to make an informed decision to approve or reject the proposed exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any exemption granted under the provisions of this section may be made subject to conditions or limitations imposed by the bank commissioner consistent with this chapter, and those conditions or limitations shall be included in an order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Rules, orders, or declaratory rulings of the bank commissioner may provide for other circumstances that justify exemption from any of the specified provisions of Title 35, specifying the provisions that are subject to the exemption request, and establishing procedures and requirements for obtaining, maintaining, or revoking exemptions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The bank commissioner may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the person or group of persons acting in concert who propose to acquire or hold directly or indirectly 10 percent or more of the beneficial ownership or control of the family trust company, new officers and directors and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  If any such person is a subsidiary of another company, the banking department may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the individuals who are the indirect owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If required by the bank commissioner, the persons described in subparagraph (a) shall submit to the banking department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints shall be necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the banking department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The bank commissioner shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the banking department.  The banking department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The bank commissioner may require the incorporators to pay the actual costs of each background investigation and criminal history records check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The bank commissioner may make further inquiry and investigation as the bank commissioner deems appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon receipt of a petition deemed to be complete by the bank commissioner, the bank commissioner shall promptly conduct an examination of all relevant facts connected with the formation of the proposed family trust company.  The bank commissioner may examine the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whether the proposed organizational and capital structure and the amount of initial capital appear adequate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whether the proposed officers and directors or managers, as a group, have sufficient experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the proposed family trust company will be free from improper or unlawful influence and otherwise will operate in compliance with law, and that success of the proposed family trust company is reasonably probable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the proposed name of the proposed family trust company is likely to mislead the public as to its character or purpose or is the same as a name already adopted by an existing bank, savings association, or trust institution in this state, or so similar thereto as to be likely to mislead the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any other factor, as the bank commissioner may deem appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The bank commissioner may make further inquiry and investigation as the bank commissioner deems appropriate.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, information bearing on actual or proposed accounts of the family trust company or proposed family trust company applying for the exemption or the identity or residence address of the designated relative or any other family member shall be confidential and not subject to public disclosure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The failure of a petitioner to furnish required information, data, other material, or the required fee within 30 days after a request may be considered an abandonment of the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any application not deemed complete may be rejected by the bank commissioner.  A rejected application may be refiled with the bank commissioner upon such form and in such manner as prescribed by the bank commissioner and a refiling fee of $10,000 shall be paid.

If a family trust company requests a hearing, the bank commissioner may not reveal confidential information prior to the conclusion of the hearing and a ruling.  Prior to dissemination of any confidential information, the bank commissioner shall require a written agreement not to reveal the confidential information by the party receiving the confidential information.  In no event shall the bank commissioner disclose confidential information to the general public, any competitor, or any potential competitor of a family trust company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude a law enforcement officer from gaining access to otherwise confidential records by subpoena, court order, search warrant, or other lawful means.  The bank commissioner may share information with other out of state or federal regulators with whom the department has an information sharing agreement.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude any agency of the state of New Hampshire from gaining access to otherwise confidential records in accordance with any applicable law, including in connection with an investigation or review of the secretary of state conducted in accordance with RSA 421-B.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-B:20 Minimum Capital Requirements;  Investment of Capital. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The initial capital required to organize a family trust company shall be not less than $250,000.  The bank commissioner may require, in the exercise of his or her discretion based on safety and soundness factors, as set forth in paragraph IV, additional capital at such levels as he or she determines is necessary to protect against the risks inherent in the business of the family trust company.  Once organized, a family trust company shall maintain a minimum level of capital required by the bank commissioner to operate in a safe and sound manner based upon his or her examination of the company, provided that the level of capital shall not be less than $250,000.  The bank commissioner may, by rule, order, or declaratory ruling set liquidity requirements for such capital.  The bank commissioner may require any family trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary to comply with reasonable trust standards, as applicable, not inconsistent with law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A family trust company shall pledge to the bank commissioner securities or a surety bond for the benefit of the bank commissioner to defray the costs of a liquidation of the family trust company by the bank commissioner in the event it should fail.  The amount of the securities or the surety bond shall be determined by the bank commissioner in an amount that he or she deems appropriate to defray such costs, but in no event shall such amount exceed $1,250,000 initially or if the family trust company has a rating from the bank commissioner of a one or 2.  If a family trust company has a rating from the bank commissioner of 3 or lower, then the amount of the securities or the surety bond shall be increased to $3,000,000 and the family trust company shall satisfy such increase within 14 calendar days of receipt of written notice from the bank commissioner.  In the event of a receivership of a family trust company, the bank commissioner may, without regard to any priorities, preferences, or adverse claims, reduce the pledged securities or the surety bond to cash and, as soon as practicable, utilize the cash to defray the costs associated with the receivership.  If the family trust company chooses to pledge securities to satisfy this provision, the securities shall be held at a depository institution or a Federal Reserve Bank approved by the bank commissioner.  The bank commissioner may specify the types of securities that may be pledged.  Any fees associated with holding such securities shall be the responsibility of the family trust company.  If the family trust company chooses to purchase a surety bond to satisfy this provision, the surety bond shall be issued by a bonding company, approved by the bank commissioner, that is authorized to do business in this state and that has a rating in one of the 3 highest grades as determined by a national rating service.  The surety bond shall be in a form approved by the bank commissioner.  The family trust company may not obtain a surety bond from any entity in which the family trust company has a financial interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The safety and soundness factors to be considered by the bank commissioner in the exercise of his or her discretion include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The nature and type of business proposed to be conducted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The nature and liquidity of assets proposed to be held in its own account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The amount of fiduciary assets projected to be under management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The type of fiduciary assets proposed to be held and the proposed depository of the assets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The complexity of fiduciary duties and degree of discretion proposed to be undertaken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The competence and experience of proposed management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The extent and adequacy of proposed internal controls.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The proposed presence or absence of annual unqualified audits by an independent certified public accountant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The reasonableness of business plans for retaining or acquiring additional equity capital.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The existence and adequacy of insurance proposed to be obtained by the family trust company for the purpose of protecting its clients, beneficiaries, and grantors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Based on the factors in paragraph III, the bank commissioner may require any family trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary for its safe and sound operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, a family trust company may invest its funds for its own account in any type or character of equity securities or debt securities subject to the limitations provided by this section, which investments shall otherwise comply with the prudent investor standard described in RSA 564-B:9-902.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Subject to paragraphs VII and VIII, the total investment in equity and investment securities of any one issuer, obligor, or maker held by a family trust company for its own account shall not exceed an amount equal to 15 percent of the family trust company's equity capital.  The bank commissioner may authorize investments in excess of this limitation if the bank commissioner concludes that the safe and sound operation of a family trust company would not be adversely affected by a proposed investment exceeding this limitation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In calculating compliance with the investment limits set forth in paragraph VI, a family trust company shall not be required to combine:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The family trust company's pro rata share of the securities of an issuer in the portfolio of a collective investment vehicle with the family trust company's pro rata share of the securities of that issuer held by another collective investment vehicle in which the family trust company has invested;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The family trust company's own direct investment in the securities of an issuer with the family trust company's pro rata share of the securities of that issuer held by collective investment vehicles in which the family trust company has invested under the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Notwithstanding paragraph VI, a family trust company may purchase for its own account, without limitation and subject only to the exercise of prudent judgment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Bonds and other general obligations of a state, an agency, or political subdivision of a state, the United States, or an agency or instrumentality of the United States.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A debt security that this state, an agency or political subdivision of this state, the United States, or an agency or instrumentality of the United States has unconditionally agreed to purchase, insure, or guarantee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Securities that are offered and sold under 15 U.S.C. section 77d(5).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Mortgage-related securities as defined in 15 U.S.C. section 78c(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Investment securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Fannie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Association, or the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Investment securities issued or guaranteed by the North American Development Bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The bank commissioner may allow a family trust company to make other investments of its corporate funds not specified in this chapter by rules, orders, or declaratory rulings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392-B:24 Termination of Exemption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If any transaction involving a family trust company requires an application to the bank commissioner for approval under this chapter, and such approval is not obtained prior to consummation of such a transaction, any exemption from the provisions of Title 35 granted to the family trust company shall automatically terminate upon the consummation of the unapproved transaction unless the bank commissioner approves the continuation of the exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The bank commissioner may revoke any exemption from the provisions of Title 35 granted to a family trust company in the following circumstances:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An officer or director of the family trust company makes a false statement under oath on any document required to be filed by this chapter or by any rules or orders of the bank commissioner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The family trust company fails to submit to an examination by the bank commissioner as required by law;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An officer or director of the family trust company withholds requested information from the bank commissioner;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the bank commissioner determines from examination or other credible evidence that a family trust company has violated any of the requirements of Title 35 or fails to meet any condition or limitation on which an exemption from the provisions of Title 35 is based, the bank commissioner may, by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, notify the family trust company that the family trust company's exemptions from the provisions of Title 35 will be revoked unless the family trust company corrects the violation or failure or shows cause why any exemptions should not be revoked.  The notification shall state grounds for the revocation with reasonable certainty and shall advise of an opportunity for a hearing.  The notice shall state the date upon which the revocation shall become effective absent a correction or showing of cause why the exemption should not be revoked, which shall not be before the 30th day after the date the notification is mailed or delivered, except as provided in paragraph IV.  The revocation shall take effect for the family trust company on the date stated in the notice if the family trust company does not request a hearing in writing before the effective date.  After the revocation takes effect, the family trust company shall be subject to all of the requirements and provisions of Title 35 applicable to a nondepository trust company.

Such determination shall be based on the factors set forth in RSA 392-B:5, VI to the extent applicable.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A family trust company seeking to dissolve its charter shall file an application for dissolution with bank commissioner accompanied by a filing fee of $1,500 payable to the bank commissioner.  The bank commissioner shall examine the application for completeness and compliance with the requirements of this section, the domestic business entity laws applicable to the requested type of liquidation or reorganization, and its rules.  The application shall include a comprehensive plan of dissolution setting forth the disposition of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect the liquidation or reorganization.  Among other things, the plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge or assumption of all of the family trust company's known or unknown claims and liabilities and the transfer of all of its responsibilities as a trustee to a successor trustee or trustees.  Additionally, the filing shall include such other certifications, affidavits, documents, or information with respect to the dissolution as the bank commissioner may require to understand how such assets and liabilities will be disposed of, the timetable for effecting disposition of such assets and liabilities, and the applicant's proposal for dealing with any claims that are asserted after the dissolution has been completed.  The bank commissioner may conduct a special examination of the applicant for purposes of evaluating the application.  Cost of the special examination shall be paid by the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the bank commissioner finds that the application for dissolution is incomplete, the bank commissioner shall return it for completion not later than 60 days after it is filed.  If the application is found to be complete by the bank commissioner, not later than 30 days thereafter, the bank commissioner shall hold a hearing for the purpose of determining whether the plan of dissolution disposes of the assets and liabilities in a lawful manner, is fair and equitable to all interested persons, has no adverse effect on the business of banking in the state, and in general carries out the purposes and intentions of RSA 392-B:28, 29 and 30.  Not later than 30 days thereafter, the bank commissioner shall either approve or not approve the application.  If the bank commissioner approves the application, then the applicant may proceed with the dissolution under the plan, subject to such conditions that the bank commissioner may prescribe.  If the applicant subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution must be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the bank commissioner and obtain his or her approval to proceed under the amended plan.  If the bank commissioner does not approve the application or amended plan, if any, the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and conditions, if any, prescribed by the bank commissioner, necessary to liquidate the family trust company or to effect the reorganization, the applicant shall submit a written report of its actions to the bank commissioner and the applicant's board of directors shall certify, under oath, that it is true and correct.  Following receipt of the report, the bank commissioner may examine the family trust company to determine whether the bank commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken to liquidate or reorganize the family trust company in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the bank commissioner.  The cost of the examination shall be paid by the applicant.  Not later than 60 days after the filing of the report, the bank commissioner shall examine the report and the bank commissioner's findings, and, if it is satisfied, shall so notify the applicant in writing that the dissolution has been completed and is final.  Thereupon, the applicant shall surrender its charter to the bank commissioner, and the bank commissioner shall issue a certificate of dissolution to be filed with the secretary of state pursuant to RSA 392-B:32.  If the bank commissioner is not satisfied that all required actions have been taken, it shall notify the applicant in writing what additional actions shall be taken to be eligible for a certificate of dissolution.  The bank commissioner shall establish a deadline for the submission of evidence that the additional actions have been taken.  The bank commissioner may extend the deadline for good cause shown.  If the applicant fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the bank commissioner, the bank commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that its application is not approved, and the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The bank commissioner may adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the procedures and requirements for a dissolution pursuant to RSA 392-B:28-32.
