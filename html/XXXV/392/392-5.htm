&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392:5 Petition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A petition setting forth said organizational instrument or its terms, signed by the organizers and requesting that the board of trust company incorporation grant a charter shall be filed with the bank commissioner in the form prescribed by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall designate in such form the questions, requests for information and certifications applicable only to deposit taking or lending institutions that need not be responded to by organizers of a nondepository trust company.  An examination fee of $5,000 shall be paid when the petition is filed.  Sums collected under this section shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the bank commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of a petition deemed to be complete by the commissioner, the commissioner shall promptly conduct an examination of all relevant facts connected with the formation of the proposed trust company.  The commissioner may examine the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The proposed market or markets to be served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whether the proposed organizational and capital structure and the amount of initial capital appear adequate in relation to the proposed business and market or markets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the anticipated volume and nature of business indicate a reasonable probability of success and profitability based on the market or markets proposed to be served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Whether the proposed officers and directors or managers, as a group, have sufficient experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the proposed trust company will be free from improper or unlawful influence and otherwise will operate in compliance with law, and that success of the proposed trust company is reasonably probable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whether the proposed name of the proposed trust company is likely to mislead the public as to its character or purpose or is the same as a name already adopted by an existing bank, savings association, or trust institution in this state, or so similar thereto as to be likely to mislead the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any other factor, as the commissioner may determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The failure of a petitioner to furnish required information, data, other material, or the required fee within 30 days after a request may be considered an abandonment of the petition.
