&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392:5 Petition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A petition setting forth said organizational instrument or its terms, signed by the organizers and requesting that the board of trust company incorporation grant a charter shall be filed with the bank commissioner in the form prescribed by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall designate in such form the questions, requests for information and certifications applicable only to deposit taking or lending institutions that need not be responded to by organizers of a nondepository trust company.  An examination fee of $5,000 shall be paid when the petition is filed.  Sums collected under this section shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the bank commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of a petition deemed to be complete by the commissioner, the commissioner shall promptly conduct an examination of all relevant facts connected with the formation of the proposed trust company.  The commissioner may examine the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The proposed market or markets to be served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whether the proposed organizational and capital structure and the amount of initial capital appear adequate in relation to the proposed business and market or markets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the anticipated volume and nature of business indicate a reasonable probability of success and profitability based on the market or markets proposed to be served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Whether the proposed officers and directors or managers, as a group, have sufficient experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the proposed trust company will be free from improper or unlawful influence and otherwise will operate in compliance with law, and that success of the proposed trust company is reasonably probable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whether the proposed name of the proposed trust company is likely to mislead the public as to its character or purpose or is the same as a name already adopted by an existing bank, savings association, or trust institution in this state, or so similar thereto as to be likely to mislead the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any other factor, as the commissioner may determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The failure of a petitioner to furnish required information, data, other material, or the required fee within 30 days after a request may be considered an abandonment of the petition.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may, at his or her discretion on request or otherwise, determine that confidential information received in connection with any petition or application of or concerning a public trust company should not be publicly available, in which case such information shall be confidential communications, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be disclosed unless, in the judgment of the commissioner, the ends of justice and the public advantage will be served by the disclosure of the information.

If a trust company requests a hearing, the commissioner may not reveal confidential information prior to the conclusion of the hearing and a ruling.  Prior to dissemination of any confidential information, the commissioner shall require a written agreement not to reveal the confidential information by the party receiving the confidential information.  In no event shall the commissioner disclose confidential information to the general public, any competitor, or any potential competitor of a trust company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this chapter is intended to preclude a law enforcement officer from gaining access to otherwise confidential records by subpoena, court order, search warrant, or other lawful means.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commissioner shall have the ability to share information with other out of state or federal regulators with whom the department has an information sharing agreement.  Nothing in this chapter is intended to preclude any agency of the state of New Hampshire from gaining access to otherwise confidential records in accordance with any applicable law, including in connection with an investigation or review of the secretary of state conducted in accordance with RSA 421-B.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392:25 Minimum Capital Requirements;  Investment of Capital. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The initial capital required to organize a trust company shall be not less than $500,000.  The board of trust company incorporation may require, in the exercise of its discretion based on safety and soundness factors, as set forth in paragraph IV, additional capital at such levels as it determines is necessary to protect against the risks inherent in the business of the trust company.  Once organized, a nondepository trust company shall maintain a minimum level of capital required by the commissioner to operate in a safe and sound manner based upon his or her examination of the company, provided that the level of capital shall not be less than $500,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to the minimum capital requirements, a trust company being organized as a nondepository trust company shall pledge to the commissioner securities or a surety bond for the benefit of the commissioner to defray the costs of a liquidation of the trust company by the commissioner in the event it should fail.  The amount of the securities or the surety bond shall be determined by the commissioner in an amount that the he or she deems appropriate to defray such costs, but in no event shall exceed $1,000,000.  In the event of a receivership of a nondepository trust company, the commissioner may, without regard to any priorities, preferences, or adverse claims, reduce the pledged securities or the surety bond to cash and, as soon as practicable, utilize the cash to defray the costs associated with the receivership.  If the nondepository trust company chooses to pledge securities to satisfy this provision, the securities shall be held at a depository institution or a Federal Reserve Bank approved by the commissioner.  The commissioner may specify the types of securities that may be pledged.  Any fees associated with holding such securities shall be the responsibility of the nondepository trust company.  If the nondepository trust company chooses to purchase a surety bond to satisfy this provision, the surety bond shall be issued by a bonding company, approved by the commissioner, that is authorized to do business in this state and that has a rating in one of the 3 highest grades as determined by a national rating service.  The surety bond shall be in a form approved by the commissioner.  The nondepository trust company may not obtain a surety bond from any entity in which the trust company has a financial interest.  The commissioner may require any trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary to comply with reasonable banking and trust standards, as applicable, not inconsistent with law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nondepository trust companies organized prior to January 1, 2007, shall be required to increase and maintain their level of capital to $500,000.  Any nondepository trust company that has less than $500,000 in capital on January 1, 2007, shall comply with the minimum capital requirement by January 1, 2010.  At a minimum, such nondepository trust company shall increase and maintain its existing capital level by at least $50,000 per year until January 1, 2010.  In addition, a nondepository trust company shall pledge to the commissioner securities or a surety bond for the benefit of the commissioner in the same manner as specified in paragraph II to defray the costs associated with a receivership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The safety and soundness factors to be considered by the board or the commissioner in the exercise of their discretion include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The nature and type of business proposed to be conducted including, without limitation, whether the company will accept deposits or make loans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The nature and liquidity of assets proposed to be held in its own account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The amount of fiduciary assets projected to be under management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The type of fiduciary assets proposed to be held and the proposed depository of the assets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The complexity of fiduciary duties and degree of discretion proposed to be undertaken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The competence and experience of proposed management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) The extent and adequacy of proposed internal controls.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) The proposed presence or absence of annual unqualified audits by an independent certified public accountant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) The reasonableness of business plans for retaining or acquiring additional equity capital.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) The existence and adequacy of insurance proposed to be obtained by the trust company for the purpose of protecting its clients, beneficiaries, and grantors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Based on the factors in paragraph IV, the commissioner may require any trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary for its safe and sound operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, a nondepository trust company may invest its funds for its own account in any type or character of equity securities or debt securities subject to the limitations provided by this section, which investments shall otherwise comply with the prudent investor standard described in RSA 564-B:9-902.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Subject to paragraphs VIII and IX, the total investment in equity and investment securities of any one issuer, obligor, or maker held by a nondepository trust company for its own account shall not exceed an amount equal to 15 percent of the nondepository trust company's equity capital.  The commissioner may authorize investments in excess of this limitation if the commissioner concludes that the safe and sound operation of a nondepository trust company would not be adversely affected by a proposed investment exceeding this limitation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In calculating compliance with the investment limits set forth in paragraph VII, a nondepository trust company shall not be required to combine:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The nondepository trust company's pro rata share of the securities of an issuer in the portfolio of a collective investment vehicle with the nondepository trust company's pro rata share of the securities of that issuer held by another collective investment vehicle in which the nondepository trust company has invested;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The nondepository trust company's own direct investment in the securities of an issuer with the nondepository trust company's pro rata share of the securities of that issuer held by collective investment vehicles in which the nondepository trust company has invested under the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Notwithstanding paragraph VII, a nondepository trust company may purchase for its own account, without limitation and subject only to the exercise of prudent judgment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Bonds and other general obligations of a state, an agency, or political subdivision of a state, the United States, or an agency or instrumentality of the United States.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A debt security that this state, an agency or political subdivision of this state, the United States, or an agency or instrumentality of the United States has unconditionally agreed to purchase, insure, or guarantee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Securities that are offered and sold under 15 U.S.C. section 77d(5).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Mortgage-related securities as defined in 15 U.S.C. section 78c(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Investment securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Fannie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Association, or the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Investment securities issued or guaranteed by the North American Development Bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The commissioner may allow a nondepository trust company to make other investments of its corporate funds not specified in this chapter by rules, orders, or declaratory rulings.

Such dissolution may be accomplished by the liquidation of the trust company or by reorganizing the trust company into a domestic or foreign corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership that does not have banking or trust powers, and in both instances surrendering its trust company charter to the board of trust company incorporation.  A trust company that reorganizes into any other entity pursuant to this section shall not engage in any activity that is authorized only for a bank or a trust company.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392:46 Approval of Voluntary Dissolution;  Filing Fee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A nondepository trust company seeking to dissolve its charter shall file an application for dissolution with the board of trust company incorporation accompanied by a filing fee of $1500 payable to the bank commissioner.  The bank commissioner shall examine the application for completeness and compliance with the requirements of this section, the domestic business entity laws applicable to the requested type of liquidation or reorganization, and its rules.  The application shall include a comprehensive plan of dissolution setting forth the disposition of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect the liquidation or reorganization.  Among other things, the plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge or assumption of all of the nondepository trust company's known or unknown claims and liabilities and the transfer of all of its responsibilities as a trustee to a successor trustee or trustees.  Additionally, the filing shall include such other certifications, affidavits, documents or information with respect to the dissolution as the board may require to understand how such assets and liabilities will be disposed of, the timetable for effecting disposition of such assets and liabilities, and the applicant's proposal for dealing with any claims that are asserted after the dissolution has been completed.  The bank commissioner may conduct a special examination of the applicant for purposes of evaluating the application.  Cost of the special examination shall be paid by the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the bank commissioner finds that the application for dissolution is incomplete, the bank commissioner shall return it for completion not later than 60 days after it is filed.  If the application is found to be complete by the bank commissioner, he or she shall so notify the board in writing and shall report any information he or she has obtained from an examination of the applicant to the board.  Not later than 30 days thereafter, the board shall hold a hearing for the purpose of determining whether the plan of dissolution disposes of the assets and liabilities in a lawful manner, is fair and equitable to all interested persons, has no adverse effect on the business of banking in the state and in general carries out the purposes and intentions of RSA 392:43-45.  Not later than 30 days thereafter, the board shall either approve or not approve the application.  If the board approves the application, then the applicant may proceed with the dissolution under the plan, subject to such conditions that the board may prescribe.  If the applicant subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution must be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the board and obtain its approval to proceed under the amended plan.  If the board does not approve the application or amended plan, if any, the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and conditions, if any, prescribed by the board of incorporation, necessary to liquidate the trust company or to effect the reorganization, the applicant shall submit a written report of its actions to the board of incorporation and the applicant's board of directors shall certify, under oath, that it is true and correct.  Following receipt of the report, the bank commissioner may examine the trust company to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken to liquidate or reorganize the trust company in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the board.  Not later than 60 days after the filing of the report, the board of incorporation shall examine the report and the bank commissioner's findings, and, if it is satisfied, shall so notify the applicant in writing that the dissolution has been completed and is final.  Thereupon, the applicant shall surrender its charter to the board, and the board shall issue a certificate of dissolution to be filed with the secretary of state pursuant to RSA 392:47.  If the board is not satisfied that all required actions have been taken, it shall notify the applicant in writing what additional actions shall be taken to be eligible for a certificate of dissolution.  The board shall establish a deadline for the submission of evidence that the additional actions have been taken.  The board may extend the deadline for good cause shown.  If the applicant fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the board of incorporation, the board shall notify the applicant in writing that its application is not approved, and the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board may adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the procedures and requirements for a dissolution pursuant to RSA 392:43-47.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392:47 Procedure;  Effect;  Recording Fee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the board of trust company incorporation approves a voluntary dissolution application, the applicant shall file the certificate of dissolution in the office of the secretary of state, accompanied by a fee of $35.  In the case of a reorganization, the applicant shall also file the documents required by the secretary of state for domestic business entities to complete a statutory reorganization of the type approved by the board, including the organizational instruments for the reorganized entity.  The secretary of state shall record the certificate and other documents, if any, and issue a certificate evidencing such liquidation or reorganization, as applicable.  When the secretary of state has issued a certificate evidencing the liquidation or reorganization, as applicable, the dissolving banking corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or limited partnership shall be deemed to have been voluntarily dissolved or reorganized, as applicable, with the same effect as if such voluntary dissolution or reorganization had been effected by a domestic business corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership, by making the filings required of such domestic business entities under the provisions of state law applicable to such domestic business entities.
