<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI. A nondepository trust company seeking to dissolve its charter shall file an application for dissolution with the commissioner accompanied by a filing fee of $1500 payable to the bank commissioner.  The bank commissioner shall examine the application for completeness and compliance with the requirements of this section, the domestic business entity laws applicable to the requested type of liquidation or reorganization, and its rules.  The application shall include a comprehensive plan of dissolution setting forth the disposition of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect the liquidation or reorganization.  Among other things, the plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge or assumption of all of the nondepository trust company's known or unknown claims and liabilities and the transfer of all of its responsibilities as a trustee to a successor trustee or trustees.  Additionally, the filing shall include such other certifications, affidavits, documents or information with respect to the dissolution as the commissioner may require to understand how such assets and liabilities will be disposed of, the timetable for effecting disposition of such assets and liabilities, and the applicant's proposal for dealing with any claims that are asserted after the dissolution has been completed.

If the bank commissioner finds that the application for dissolution is incomplete, the bank commissioner shall return it for completion not later than 60 days after it is filed.  If the application is found to be complete by the bank commissioner, he or she shall examine the plan of dissolution for the purpose of determining whether the plan of dissolution disposes of the assets and liabilities in a lawful manner, is fair and equitable to all interested persons, has no adverse effect on the business of banking in the state and in general carries out the purposes and intentions of RSA 392:43-45.  If the commissioner concludes that these considerations are satisfied, he or she shall approve the application.  The applicant may then proceed with the dissolution under the plan, subject to such conditions that the commissioner may prescribe.  If the applicant subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution must be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the commissioner and obtain his or her approval to proceed under the amended plan.  If the commissioner does not approve the application or amended plan, if any, the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to RSA 541.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and conditions, if any, prescribed by the commissioner, necessary to liquidate the trust company or to effect the reorganization, the applicant shall submit a written report of its actions to the commissioner and the applicant's board of directors shall certify, under oath, that it is true and correct.  Following receipt of the report, the bank commissioner may examine the trust company to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken to liquidate or reorganize the trust company in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed.  Not later than 60 days after the filing of the report, the commissioner, if he or she is so satisfied, shall so notify the applicant in writing that the dissolution has been completed and is final.  Thereupon, the applicant shall surrender its charter to the commissioner, and the commissioner shall issue a certificate of dissolution to be filed with the secretary of state pursuant to RSA 392:47.  If the commissioner is not satisfied that all required actions have been taken, he or she shall notify the applicant in writing what additional actions shall be taken to be eligible for a certificate of dissolution.  The commissioner shall establish a deadline for the submission of evidence that the additional actions have been taken.  The commissioner may extend the deadline for good cause shown.  If the applicant fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that its application is not approved, and the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to RSA 541.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV.
