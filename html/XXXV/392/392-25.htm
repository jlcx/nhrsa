&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 392:25 Minimum Capital Requirements;  Investment of Capital. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The initial capital required to organize a trust company shall be not less than $500,000.  The board of trust company incorporation may require, in the exercise of its discretion based on safety and soundness factors, as set forth in paragraph IV, additional capital at such levels as it determines is necessary to protect against the risks inherent in the business of the trust company.  Once organized, a nondepository trust company shall maintain a minimum level of capital required by the commissioner to operate in a safe and sound manner based upon his or her examination of the company, provided that the level of capital shall not be less than $500,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to the minimum capital requirements, a trust company being organized as a nondepository trust company shall pledge to the commissioner securities or a surety bond for the benefit of the commissioner to defray the costs of a liquidation of the trust company by the commissioner in the event it should fail.  The amount of the securities or the surety bond shall be determined by the commissioner in an amount that the he or she deems appropriate to defray such costs, but in no event shall exceed $1,000,000.  In the event of a receivership of a nondepository trust company, the commissioner may, without regard to any priorities, preferences, or adverse claims, reduce the pledged securities or the surety bond to cash and, as soon as practicable, utilize the cash to defray the costs associated with the receivership.  If the nondepository trust company chooses to pledge securities to satisfy this provision, the securities shall be held at a depository institution or a Federal Reserve Bank approved by the commissioner.  The commissioner may specify the types of securities that may be pledged.  Any fees associated with holding such securities shall be the responsibility of the nondepository trust company.  If the nondepository trust company chooses to purchase a surety bond to satisfy this provision, the surety bond shall be issued by a bonding company, approved by the commissioner, that is authorized to do business in this state and that has a rating in one of the 3 highest grades as determined by a national rating service.  The surety bond shall be in a form approved by the commissioner.  The nondepository trust company may not obtain a surety bond from any entity in which the trust company has a financial interest.  The commissioner may require any trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary to comply with reasonable banking and trust standards, as applicable, not inconsistent with law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nondepository trust companies organized prior to January 1, 2007, shall be required to increase and maintain their level of capital to $500,000.  Any nondepository trust company that has less than $500,000 in capital on January 1, 2007, shall comply with the minimum capital requirement by January 1, 2010.  At a minimum, such nondepository trust company shall increase and maintain its existing capital level by at least $50,000 per year until January 1, 2010.  In addition, a nondepository trust company shall pledge to the commissioner securities or a surety bond for the benefit of the commissioner in the same manner as specified in paragraph II to defray the costs associated with a receivership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The safety and soundness factors to be considered by the board or the commissioner in the exercise of their discretion include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The nature and type of business proposed to be conducted including, without limitation, whether the company will accept deposits or make loans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The nature and liquidity of assets proposed to be held in its own account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The amount of fiduciary assets projected to be under management.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(10) The existence and adequacy of insurance proposed to be obtained by the trust company for the purpose of protecting its clients, beneficiaries, and grantors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Based on the factors in paragraph IV, the commissioner may require any trust company to increase its capital funds from time to time as may be necessary for its safe and sound operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, a nondepository trust company may invest its funds for its own account in any type or character of equity securities or debt securities subject to the limitations provided by this section, which investments shall otherwise comply with the prudent investor standard described in RSA 564-B:9-902.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Subject to paragraphs VIII and IX, the total investment in equity and investment securities of any one issuer, obligor, or maker held by a nondepository trust company for its own account shall not exceed an amount equal to 15 percent of the nondepository trust company's equity capital.  The commissioner may authorize investments in excess of this limitation if the commissioner concludes that the safe and sound operation of a nondepository trust company would not be adversely affected by a proposed investment exceeding this limitation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In calculating compliance with the investment limits set forth in paragraph VII, a nondepository trust company shall not be required to combine:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The nondepository trust company's own direct investment in the securities of an issuer with the nondepository trust company's pro rata share of the securities of that issuer held by collective investment vehicles in which the nondepository trust company has invested under the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
