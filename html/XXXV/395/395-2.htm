The court may issue an injunction prohibiting, as far as may be thought necessary, the transaction of any business of said institution and the commissioner shall cause the same to be served.  Any justice of the superior court, upon petition and notice to the commissioner, may dissolve, modify, continue or extend such injunction as equity may require.  If in the opinion of said justice the public good requires he may direct the commissioner to take possession forthwith of the property and business of such institution, and he may retain possession thereof until it shall resume business, or until its affairs shall finally be liquidated as herein provided;  and upon completing such liquidation the charter of such institution shall be vacated.
