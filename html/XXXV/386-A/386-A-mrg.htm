&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Notwithstanding RSA 304-C:21, I or any other provision of law to the contrary, a guaranty savings bank may be organized as a limited liability company.  A bank organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to the provisions of state law applicable to such type of entity, provided, however, any filing required to be made with the secretary of state shall be made instead with the bank commissioner.  Any reference to a corporation in the banking statutes shall also include a limited liability company.  A bank organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to all of the same laws and regulations that relate to a bank organized as a corporation.  All managers and employees of a bank organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to the same duties and liabilities as pertain to directors, trustees, and employees of a bank organized as a corporation.  Any reference to corporations, directors, officers, stockholders, or other like terms used to describe corporations in the banking statutes shall be construed to apply in the same manner to limited liability companies, managers, employees, members, or other like terms used to describe limited liability companies unless the context otherwise requires.  The organizational instruments of a bank either chartered or operating as a limited liability company shall satisfy the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in order to be deemed "incorporated'' for purposes of federal deposit insurance.

Sums collected under this section shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the bank commissioner.  The bank commissioner shall examine and investigate each petition as he or she considers expedient.  The commissioner may, upon request of any interested person or corporation or at his or her own discretion, order a public hearing, or may approve said petition without a hearing.  The petitioners shall cause to be published such notices relating to the petition as the commissioner may order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The department may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the petitioner's organizers, officers, and directors, trustees, or managers and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  The department may also complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on any person, including an individual, that owns, beneficially owns, has the right to vote, or has the power to sell or direct the sale of 10 percent or more of the petitioner.  If the petitioner is a subsidiary, the department may complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the individuals who are the indirect owners, as defined in RSA 397-A:1, VIII-a.

A savings bank organized hereunder may accept savings deposits from any person, firm, association or corporation disposed to enjoy the advantages of such bank.  Any such bank may classify its holders of interest bearing savings accounts according to the character, amount, duration, volume or regularity of their dealings with the bank, may by bylaw determine the privileges and obligations of each such class of depositors, and, subject to other applicable provisions of law, may divide the net income or profits of deposits, based on such classification, at such reasonable times and in such just manner and proportion and subject to such equitable rules and regulations as the bank may from time to time provide, so long as each depositor shall receive the same rate of interest as all others in his class.  The right is reserved to such banks to refuse any sums offered for deposit and to repay deposits.  In addition to the powers contained in its bylaws, any such bank may at any time require that up to 90 days' advance notice be given to it by each depositor prior to the withdrawal of any savings deposit or portion thereof;  provided that written notice of any such action taken by the bank shall be given immediately to the bank commissioner.
