Except as provided in this paragraph, 10 persons may subscribe to articles of agreement in writing for the purpose of forming a mutual savings bank or a guaranty savings bank and may, upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter, become a corporation with all the powers and privileges and subject to all the duties, restrictions, and liabilities of either a mutual savings bank or a guaranty savings bank, as set forth in the general laws now or hereafter in force relating to such corporations.  If the bank is being organized by a bank holding company or a financial holding company as defined by the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or by a savings and loan holding company as defined by the federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, as amended, or by any other type of company that will directly or indirectly hold all of the shares of the saving bank's capital stock, or in connection with a reorganization of a bank into a holding company structure, then only the holding company or, if applicable, the subsidiary of the holding company that will hold all of the shares of the saving bank's capital stock, is required to subscribe to the articles of agreement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 386-A:1-a Limited Liability Company. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding RSA 304-C:21, I or any other provision of law to the contrary, a guaranty savings bank may be organized as a limited liability company.  A bank organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to the provisions of state law applicable to such type of entity, provided, however, any filing required to be made with the secretary of state shall be made instead with the bank commissioner.  Any reference to a corporation in the banking statutes shall also include a limited liability company.  A bank organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to all of the same laws and regulations that relate to a bank organized as a corporation.  All managers and employees of a bank organized as a limited liability company shall be subject to the same duties and liabilities as pertain to directors, trustees, and employees of a bank organized as a corporation.  Any reference to corporations, directors, officers, stockholders, or other like terms used to describe corporations in the banking statutes shall be construed to apply in the same manner to limited liability companies, managers, employees, members, or other like terms used to describe limited liability companies unless the context otherwise requires.  The organizational instruments of a bank either chartered or operating as a limited liability company shall satisfy the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in order to be deemed "incorporated'' for purposes of federal deposit insurance.
