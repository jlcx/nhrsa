<codesect>
When so provided by the bylaws, the board of directors may appoint and may provide for the compensation of loan officers to act under the supervision of the credit committee or, if none, the board of directors, and such loan officers, when so appointed and when authorized by the credit committee, or, if none, the board of directors, may approve or disapprove loans as prescribed in the lending policy, without the necessity for a meeting or approval by any member of the credit committee or, if none, the board of directors.  A member whose application was disapproved by a loan officer may appeal such action to the credit committee (or, if none, the board of directors), which may, by majority vote, reverse the loan officer's decision.
