&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 383-D:4-401 Family Client. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) With the commissioner's prior approval, a family trust company may designate a person as a family client if that person has a close and continuous relationship with one or more family clients.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person is a family client for one year after an involuntary event that otherwise would cause the person to cease to qualify as a family client.  If, as the result of an involuntary event, a person becomes a client of the family trust company but does not otherwise qualify as a family client, then the person is a family client for one year after the involuntary event.  For purposes of this subsection, an involuntary event means an event that is not within the reasonable control of the family trust company or a family client, including the divorce or death of a family member, a former family member, a key employee, or former key employee.  The revocation of an individual's designation as a key employee under RSA 383-D:4-403(b) is not an involuntary event.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a person who, immediately before a change of the designated relative as provided in RSA 383-D:10-1002 or a change of the method of determining family members as provided in RSA 383-D:10-1003, was a family client and a client of the family trust company, then that person is a family client for one year after the effective date of the change.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), an individual who is within (i) the fifth degree of lineal kinship to the designated relative or (ii) the ninth degree of collateral kinship to the designated relative;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A spouse or former spouse of an individual described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In lieu of the method for determining family members under subsection (a)(2), a family trust company may elect to treat as a family member any individual who is the designated relative's lineal descendant and is not more than 10 generations removed from the designated relative.  A family trust company that wishes to use this alternate method shall make the election on its application under RSA 383-D:5-502 or file with the commissioner a notice in accordance with RSA 383-D:10-1003.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For purposes of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a family member's child includes the family member's adopted child, stepchild, or foster child or an individual who was a minor when the family member became that individual's guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For purposes of this section, "lineal kinship'' means a family member who is in the direct line of ascent or descent from the designated relative, and "collateral kinship'' means a relationship that is not lineal, but stems from a common ancestor.  Degrees are calculated by adding the number of steps from the designated relative through each person to the family member either directly in the case of lineal kinship or through the common ancestor in the case of collateral kinship.
