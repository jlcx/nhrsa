In districts having an official ballot, the question shall appear upon the ballot pursuant to RSA 670:7.

At the next annual meeting, the village district shall elect 2 commissioners for 3-year terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the village district votes to increase the number of commissioners to 5 and its commissioners serve one-year terms, at the first annual meeting following the vote, the village district shall elect 5 commissioners for one-year terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At succeeding annual elections the village district shall fill commissioner vacancies as they regularly occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
