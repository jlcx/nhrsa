&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All political advertising shall be signed at the beginning or the end with the names and addresses of the candidate, his fiscal agent, or the name and address of the chairman or the treasurer of a political committee, or the name and address of a natural person, according to whether a candidate, political committee, or natural person is responsible for it.  Said signature shall clearly designate the name of the candidate, party or political committee by or on whose behalf the same is published or broadcast.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Political advertising to promote the success or defeat of a measure by a business organization, labor union, or other enterprise or organization shall be signed.  The name of the enterprise or organization shall be indicated and the chairman or treasurer of the enterprise or organization shall sign his name and address.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit contributions which are prohibited under RSA 664:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of printed or written matter, the signature and address of signer shall be printed or written in a size of type or lettering large enough to be clearly legible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) In the case of political advertising broadcast on radio, television, or any public address system, the name and address of the signer shall be clearly identified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) All political advertising broadcast on television shall identify the name of the candidate who pays for the advertisement or whose advertisement is paid for by a campaign committee.  Such identification shall be made both aurally and visually.  The visual presentation shall be clearly legible and shall use letters equal to or greater than 12 percent of the vertical picture height and shall air for not less than 4 seconds at the conclusion of the broadcast.  For the purpose of this section, "campaign committee'' means any committee established to elect a particular candidate to office, including raising funds for that purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, buttons or any printed or written political advertising which is attached to or displayed on any motor vehicle need not be signed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any advertising in support of or in opposition to a candidate by a political committee shall comply with this paragraph.  If the advertising is not authorized by the candidate or candidate committee, the advertising shall so state and shall identify the sponsor of the advertisement.  All such political advertising shall include the statement:  "This advertisement has been paid for by (name of sponsor) and has not been authorized by any candidate.''  Such statement shall be made both aurally and visually if broadcast on television.  The visual presentation on television shall be clearly legible and shall use letters equal to or greater than 12 percent of the vertical picture height and shall be broadcast for not less than 4 seconds at the conclusion of the advertisement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any advertising which is not political advertising because it does not advocate the success or defeat of a party, measure, or person, but which mentions or depicts a candidate, shall include the statement:  "This advertisement has been paid for by (name of sponsor) and has not been authorized by any candidate.''
