&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any political committee, except the political committee of a political party, shall register with the secretary of state as provided in this section.  The committee shall register with the secretary of state not later than 24 hours after receiving any contribution in excess of $500 or before making any expenditure in excess of $500, but in no event later than 14 days after the formation of the committee.  The registration shall be accompanied by a fee of $50, which shall be deposited by the secretary of state into the general fund;  provided, however, that the political committee of a candidate which registers under this section shall not be required to pay the $50 fee.  Each political committee shall designate a treasurer or agent who is a citizen of this state and who is authorized to receive all process and other legal documents on behalf of the political committee, and through whom may be obtained access to all books and records of the political committee.  The political committee shall file with the secretary of state a statement of the purpose of the committee and shall indicate whether the committee will be making independent expenditures in support of or in opposition to any candidate including a statement of the name, address, occupation, and principal place of business of its chairperson and treasurer or agent, and the names and addresses of other officers.  The committee shall file an amendment to its registration within 14 days of any change in the officers or purpose of the committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No member of a political committee which is required to register under RSA 664:3, I, except members of political committees of political parties, shall do any act directly or indirectly on behalf of the committee to promote the success or defeat of a political party, a measure or a candidate, unless the requirements of RSA 664:3, I are met.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any political committee which is organized to support a candidate in any election shall secure the written consent of the candidate or his fiscal agent before it receives contributions or makes expenditures.  Such written consent shall be filed with the secretary of state when the statements required by paragraph I are filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All political committees' registrations under this chapter shall be valid from the date of registration until 10 days after the primary or general election, whichever is appropriate, unless terminated sooner, in writing, by the chairman and the treasurer of the committee.  However, any committee which has a continuing obligation to report as required under RSA 664:6 shall continue to exist for the purpose of making such reports.
