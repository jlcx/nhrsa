<codesect>
A political committee of a candidate or a candidate may electronically report receipts and expenditures, as required by RSA 664:6, 664:7, and 664:7-b, by uploading the report to the secretary of state's website.  The report shall be publicly available on the website on or before the date that an itemized statement of receipts and expenditures is due.  The committee or candidate may publicly release receipt and expenditure information under this section more frequently than is required by RSA 664:6, 664:7, and 664:7-b provided the receipt and expenditure report is up to date when due.
