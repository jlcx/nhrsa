<codesect>
Absent uniformed services voters, absent voters temporarily residing outside the United States, and federal ballot only voters domiciled outside the United States may use the federal write-in absentee ballot in general, special, and primary elections to vote for federal offices only.  As required by federal law, a federal write-in absentee ballot shall not be counted if it is submitted from any location in the United States by an absent voter temporarily residing outside the United States or a federal ballot only voter domiciled outside the United States.  The federal write-in absentee ballot shall not be counted if a state absentee ballot is received from the voter.  In completing the ballot, the voter may designate a candidate by writing in the name of the candidate or by writing in the name of a political party next to the title of the office, in which case the ballot shall be counted for that office for the candidate of the political party.  Clerks may use the federal write-in absentee ballot as a request for an official absentee ballot as provided for in RSA 657:12.
