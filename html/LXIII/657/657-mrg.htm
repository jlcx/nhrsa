&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 657:16 Refusal to Certify;  Procedure.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If he or she refuses to certify the application, the town or city clerk shall notify the applicant in writing within 7 days to that effect.  The town or city clerk shall provide the applicant with an absentee ballot and a notice that the ballot will not be counted unless the applicant submits the documents necessary to complete an absentee registration.  The applicant shall be advised in writing what documents, if any, have been received in proper form and which the applicant must submit in the outer envelope that contains the absentee ballot envelope.  The town or city clerk shall mark the absentee ballot application, the absentee ballot affidavit, and the outer envelope with the words "Not Registered.''  Upon receipt of an outer envelope marked "Not Registered,'' the clerk shall open the outer envelope.  If the applicant returns the required documents with the absentee ballot by the date set for correcting the checklist under RSA 654:27 and RSA 654:28, the town or city clerk shall forward the registration forms to the supervisors of the checklist and, if the applicant is found to be qualified, the applicant shall be registered and his or her absentee ballot shall be processed in the same manner as the absentee ballot of a previously registered voter.  All documents received after the deadline for correcting the checklist under RSA 654:27 and RSA 654:28 shall be processed as election day registrations under RSA 654:7-a.  If the ballot is returned without the required documents in proper form, the ballot shall be marked in the manner set forth by law for successfully challenged absentee ballots and preserved in accordance with RSA 33-A:3-a.  The clerk shall preserve the application of any applicant who is not registered as a voter until the time set by law for the destruction of the ballots after the election at which time the application shall be destroyed.  Any justice of the superior court has jurisdiction in equity upon such notice as he or she may order to require that the name of the person making application for an absentee ballot be placed upon the checklist or registered as a member of any party and be sent an absentee ballot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 657:21-a Special Assistance to Emergency Services Worker. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an emergency services worker receives notice after noon on the Friday before any state election that he or she is being called into service under circumstances that will prevent that person from obtaining an absentee ballot before leaving and from voting in person at the polls on election day, upon notification that such a call-out has occurred, the secretary of state with assistance from the attorney general and the department of safety shall make every reasonable effort to cause absentee ballot request forms, absentee ballots, absentee affidavits, and any other materials necessary to vote to be transported to the emergency services workers and to be returned to the town or city clerk of each voter's town or ward.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, "emergency services worker'' shall include law enforcement, emergency medical services personnel, firefighters, members of the New Hampshire national guard, utility workers, employees or volunteers for the American Red Cross, and any other emergency worker declared such by the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purposes of this section "every reasonable effort'' includes, but is not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Employing local, county, or state law enforcement to transport ballots, affidavits, and other necessary materials to and from the site in New Hampshire where emergency services are temporarily housed, staged, or deployed for an in-state emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Causing ballots, affidavits, and other necessary materials to be transported by the United States mail or commercial overnight courier to and from an out-of-state site where emergency services workers are temporarily housed, staged, or deployed for an out-of-state emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For the purposes of this section "circumstances that will prevent that person from voting in person at the polls on election day'' shall include deployment to any disaster that has been declared by the President of the United States or the governor of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, any ballot returned to a polling place pursuant to this section which arrives before the polls are closed shall be processed according to law and if found otherwise in conformance with law shall be counted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If, in the judgment of the secretary of state, time does not permit obtaining and transporting the local ballot for each emergency services worker, the secretary of state may prepare and issue a statewide-offices-only absentee ballot for the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The secretary of state, in cooperation with the department of safety and the attorney general, shall develop procedures for implementing this section.  The procedures shall include publication of an emergency telephone number available 24 hours daily during the period covered by this section, to allow after-hours and weekend notification to the secretary of state that this section is being invoked.  Suitable information on the availability of this section shall be made available to persons covered by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The public agency or employer of emergency services workers responsible for making call-outs subject to the provisions of this section shall provide the secretary of state with the name and domicile address of each person called out and an address where an absentee ballot may be delivered on the Saturday, Sunday, or Monday prior to the election at the site of the emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the costs of executing this section at any election exceed $500, the secretary of state shall certify the same to the state treasurer, and prepare a manifest to authorize the state treasurer to make payments from funds not otherwise appropriated.  The governor is authorized to draw a warrant for said sums out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.
