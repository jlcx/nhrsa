&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 657:26 Absentee Voter Website. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The secretary of state shall make available by July 31, 2010 a public website by which an absentee voter, in the 2010 general election and every subsequent state election, may determine whether the voter's absentee ballot request has been received by the clerk, whether the absentee ballot has been sent pursuant to such request, and whether the envelope purporting to contain the absentee ballot has been received by the clerk.  The town and city clerk shall, without delay, enter into the statewide centralized voter registration database the dates that all valid requests for absentee ballots are received, the dates all absentee ballots are sent, and the dates all envelopes purporting to contain absentee ballots are received.  The secretary of state shall allow free and secure access to any voter who enters on the website his or her full first name, full last name, the town where the voter has requested an absentee ballot, and the voter's date of birth as they appear in the statewide centralized voter registration database.  The city and town clerk shall provide instructions to absentee voter applicants describing how to access this website.
