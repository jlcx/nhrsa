&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 659:52 Opening Envelope;  Depositing Ballot. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the absentee ballot is not challenged, the moderator shall, after announcing the name of the voter, open the envelope containing the ballot so the affidavit is not destroyed.  The moderator shall then take the ballot out of the envelope without unfolding the ballot or without permitting the ballot to be examined, and he or she shall preserve the affidavit with the ballots cast at the election as provided in RSA 659:101.  The moderator shall then have a checkmark placed beside the name of the absentee voter on the checklist and write therewith the letters "A.V.'' in red ink and shall then deposit the ballot in the ballot box.
