<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person is guilty of a class B felony if, at any election, such person knowingly checks in at the checklist and casts a New Hampshire ballot on which one or more federal or statewide offices or statewide questions are listed if the person also casts a ballot in the same election year in any election held in any other state or territory of the United States where one or more federal or statewide offices or statewide questions are listed.  For federal or statewide offices and statewide questions, neither the candidates nor the questions need be the same in both jurisdictions for a violation to occur.  The titles for offices need not be identical, but must serve an equivalent role in government, for a violation to occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Two or more elections occur with the same election year if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The election for federal or statewide office or on a question being voted on statewide in another state or territory is held on the same day that New Hampshire holds its general election;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The term of office for any office listed on the ballot in the other state or territory starts in the same year as the term of office for that office or its equivalent in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state shall not be required to prove that the person actually marked the ballot for a candidate for any specific office;  it shall be sufficient to prove that the person cast a ballot.  Evidence that a person was checked off on the checklist, or the equivalent record in another state or territory, as having voted is prima facie evidence that the person cast a ballot in that election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the election in New Hampshire and the other state or territory are held on different dates, it is an affirmative defense that the person legitimately moved his or her domicile to or from the other state or territory between the dates when the elections were held.
