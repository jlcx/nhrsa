&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 659:50 Announcement by Moderator. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The moderator shall begin processing absentee ballots by clearly announcing that he or she is about to open the envelopes which were delivered to him or her.  The moderator shall then remove the envelope containing the ballots of each absentee voter and shall compare the signature on the affidavit with the signature on the application for the ballot.  If:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The name of the voter is on the checklist;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The affidavit appears to be properly executed;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The signature on the affidavit appears to be executed by the same person who signed the application;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The signatures appear to be the signatures of a duly qualified voter who has not voted at the election;  then the moderator shall publicly announce the name of the absentee voter, except that with respect to any voter who has been included in the address confidentiality program under RSA 7:43 or who has been granted a protective order under RSA 173-B, the moderator shall identify such voters as "confidential voter number 1'' and "confidential voter number 2,'' and so forth.  If these conditions are not met, the moderator shall follow the procedure provided in RSA 659:53.
