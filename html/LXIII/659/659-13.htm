&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 659:13 Obtaining a Ballot. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person desiring to vote shall, before being admitted to the enclosed space within the guardrail, announce his or her name to one of the ballot clerks who shall thereupon repeat the name;  and, if the name is found on the checklist by the ballot clerk, the ballot clerk shall put a checkmark beside it and again repeat the name.  The ballot clerk shall state the address listed on the checklist for the voter, and ask if the address is correct;  if the address on the checklist is not correct, the ballot clerk shall correct the address in red on the paper checklist and the supervisors of the checklist shall cause the centralized voter registration database to reflect the correction.  The ballot clerk shall request that the voter present a valid photo identification meeting the requirements of paragraph II.  If the voter does not have a valid photo identification, the ballot clerk shall inform the voter that he or she may execute a challenged voter affidavit.  The voter, if still qualified to vote in the town or ward and having presented a valid photo identification verifying the voter's identity or executed a challenged voter affidavit, and unless challenged as provided for in RSA 659:27 through 659:33, shall then be allowed to enter the space enclosed by the guardrail.  After the voter enters the enclosed space, the ballot clerk shall give the voter one of each ballot to be voted on in that election which shall be folded as it was upon receipt from the secretary of state.  The ballot clerk shall also mark the checklist using a ruler or other straight edge to ensure accuracy of the mark in order to show that the voter obtained his or her ballot.  The person entering voter information into the centralized voter registration database shall cause the records to indicate when a voter has not presented a valid photo identification and whether such voter executed a challenged voter affidavit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The following forms of identification bearing a photograph of the voter shall satisfy the identification requirements of paragraph I:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A driver's license issued by the state of New Hampshire or any other state, regardless of expiration date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An identification card issued by the director of motor vehicles under the provisions of RSA 260:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A United States armed services identification card.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A United States passport, regardless of expiration date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any other valid photo identification issued by federal, state, county, or municipal government.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A valid student identification card.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A photo identification not authorized by subparagraphs (a) through (f) but determined to be legitimate by the supervisors of the checklist, the moderator, or the town or city clerk, provided that if any person authorized to challenge a voter under RSA 659:27 objects to the use of such photo identification, the voter shall be required to execute a challenged voter affidavit as if no identification was presented.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Verification of the person's identity by a moderator or supervisor of the checklist or the town or city clerk, provided that if any person authorized to challenge a voter under RSA 659:27 objects to such verification, the voter shall be required to execute a challenged voter affidavit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a voter on the nonpublic checklist executes a challenged voter affidavit in accordance with paragraph I, the affidavit shall not be subject to RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The secretary of state shall cause a letter of identity verification to be mailed by first class mail to each voter who executed a challenged voter affidavit in accordance with paragraph I.  The letter shall be mailed within 60 days after the election, except that if the election is a state primary election, the letter shall be mailed 60 days after the general election, and if the election is a regularly scheduled municipal election, the letter shall be mailed by the July 1 or January 1 next following the election.  The secretary of state shall mark the envelope with instructions to the United States Post Office not to forward the letter and to provide address correction information.  The letter shall notify the person that a person who did not present valid photo identification voted using his or her name and address and instruct the person to return the letter within 90 days with a written confirmation that the person voted or to contact the attorney general immediately if he or she did not vote.  The letter shall also inform the person of the procedure for obtaining a free nondriver's picture identification card for voting purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The secretary of state shall cause any letters mailed pursuant to subparagraph (a) that are returned as undeliverable by the United States Post Office to be referred to the attorney general.  The secretary of state shall also prepare and forward to the attorney general a list of all persons who were mailed letters under subparagraph (a) and have not confirmed that they voted.  Upon receipt of notice from a person who receives a letter of identity verification that the person did not vote, or upon receipt of a referral from the secretary of state, the attorney general shall cause an investigation to be made to determine whether fraudulent voting occurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Within 60 days after a state general election, the secretary of state shall compile a report of the number of voters that did not present valid photo identification at each election occurring since the previous state general election, and forward the report to the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, and the chairpersons of the appropriate house and senate standing committees with jurisdiction over election law.
