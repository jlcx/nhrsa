I. Processing of previously received absentee ballots shall begin at 1:00 p.m.  The processing of the absentee ballots shall not unnecessarily interfere with normal voting procedures, nor shall the polls be closed at any time during the processing of such ballots.  Absentee ballots which are received after 1:00 p.m. and prior to 5:00 p.m. shall be processed as soon after receipt as possible.  Under no circumstances shall absentee ballots be counted prior to the closing of the polls.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, upon the written challenges of 10 or more voters who are present at the polls no later than 1:00 p.m., the moderator shall postpone the processing of all absentee ballots until after the polls close and prior to the counting of all ballots cast in the election.
