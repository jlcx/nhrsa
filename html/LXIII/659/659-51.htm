&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 659:51 Challenges. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All absentee ballots are subject to challenge after the moderator publicly announces the name of the absentee voter, except for voters provided for in RSA 7:46, but not after the ballot is removed from the envelope.  No challenge to an absentee ballot may be asserted except in conformity with the requirements of RSA 659:27-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the ballot is challenged, the moderator shall write on the envelope containing the ballot the word "challenged'' and the name and address of the person who makes the challenge and the basis of the challenge.  The moderator shall also number each challenged envelope consecutively by marking, for example, the first challenged ballot "Challenged Ballot No. 1.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The moderator shall then determine if the challenge to the ballot is well grounded.  If the moderator decides the challenge is well grounded, the moderator shall not open the envelope but shall preserve it with the other ballots cast at the election as provided in RSA 659:101 and shall record next to the name of the absentee voter on the clerk's list of absentee voters prepared pursuant to RSA 657:15 the word "challenged'' and the reason for the challenge.  The clerk shall record this information in the statewide centralized voter registration database.  If the moderator decides that the challenge is not well grounded, he or she shall open the envelope so the affidavit is not destroyed and proceed first to mark on the reverse of the folded ballot the corresponding challenge number as previously marked on the envelope.  The moderator shall then proceed to deposit the ballot as provided in RSA 659:52.
