<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every candidate for state or federal office who intends to have his or her name printed upon the ballot of any party for a primary shall designate in the declaration of candidacy, or on the primary petitions and assents to candidacy, the form in which the candidate's name shall be printed on the ballot.  The designated name may include the candidate's given name or a shortened form of the candidate's given name or a one-word nickname customarily related to the candidate, and by which the candidate is commonly recognized.  The designated name may also include an initial for the first or middle name, or both.  No candidate may designate a nickname that implies that the candidate is some other person, that constitutes a slogan or otherwise associates the candidate with a cause or issue, that has an offensive or profane meaning, or that creates a perception of a professional or vocational affiliation, such as "Doc'' or "Coach.''  No candidate may designate a name or nickname that includes characters other than the 26-letter English alphabet, a dash, an apostrophe, a period, or a comma.  A candidate shall include his or her surname in the designation of the form in which the candidate's name shall be printed on the ballot.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every candidate for state or federal office who intends to have his or her name placed on the ballot for the state general election by means other than nomination by party primary shall designate in the declaration of intent the form in which the candidate's name shall be printed on the ballot.  The designated name may include the candidate's given name or a shortened form of the candidate's given name or a one-word nickname customarily related to the candidate, and by which the candidate is commonly recognized.  The designated name may also include an initial for the first or middle name, or both.  No candidate may designate a nickname that implies that the candidate is some other person, that constitutes a slogan or otherwise associates the candidate with a cause or issue, that has an offensive or profane meaning, or that creates a perception of a professional or vocational affiliation, such as "Doc'' or "Coach.''  No candidate may designate a name or nickname that includes characters other than the 26-letter English alphabet, a dash, an apostrophe, a period, or a comma.  A candidate shall include his or her surname in the designation of the form in which the candidate's name shall be printed on the ballot.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A candidate who files more than one declaration of candidacy or declaration of intent shall designate the same form of his or her name to appear on each such declaration.  The same form of a candidate's name shall also appear on every primary petition and assent to candidacy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the appropriate official with whom the declaration of candidacy, declaration of intent, primary petitions, or assents to candidacy are filed does not accept them and returns them to the candidate because in the opinion of the official they do not conform to the provisions of this section, the candidate may appeal to the ballot law commission as provided in RSA 665:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Legal names shall be placed on the ballot in a manner that the appearance of the name is consistent with the appearance of other names on the ballot as determined by the secretary of state.  A candidate may appeal the decision of the secretary of state relative to the appearance of the candidate's name on the ballot to the ballot law commission within 5 days of receiving notification under RSA 664:22.
