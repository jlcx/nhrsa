It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the provisions of part 2, article 11-a of the New Hampshire constitution regarding division of representative districts into 2 or more representative districts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 662-A:2 Scope of Authorization. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any incorporated town comprising a single state representative district under RSA 662:5 shall be entitled to exercise the powers recognized by article 11-a, part second, of the New Hampshire constitution, and implemented through this chapter, to create a redistricting commission to present to its voters a referendum to request that the legislature divide the town into 2 or more districts for the purpose of electing representatives to the general court.  If a town to be divided into districts under this chapter is included in a floterial district and also has a non-floterial district solely made up of representatives from the town, the provisions of this chapter shall only apply to the non-floterial district.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Within 10 days of the filing of a preliminary report relative to any redistricting proposal, the town clerk shall file certified copies of the report with the secretary of state.  Within 30 days of the receipt of the preliminary report, the secretary of state shall review the redistricting proposal to insure that it is consistent with the principle of one-person, one-vote using the most recent decennial census figures for the town and to insure that no provision of the redistricting of the town is in conflict with the constitution or laws of this state or the United States.

The secretary of state shall specify objections in writing to the commission within the period of time allowed for review and shall offer recommendations for changes in the redistricting proposal which would correct any inconsistencies in the proposal.  Failure to specify objections to a redistricting proposal under this section shall constitute approval by the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission may seek judicial review of a disapproval of the proposal by the secretary of state in superior court to determine the lawfulness of the decision of the secretary of state.  The clerk of the court shall schedule a hearing on any such appeal within 10 days of the filing of the petition.
