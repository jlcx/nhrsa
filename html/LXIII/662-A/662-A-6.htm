&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Following approval of the commission's proposal, the secretary of state shall submit proposed districts to the voters of the town at the next town election.  The wording of the question shall be:
<br>
"Do you favor dividing the town into representative districts for the purpose of electing representatives to the general court as recommended by the redistricting commission?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The selectmen or town council shall cause the final report of the commission to be printed in the town report, shall make copies available in the clerk's office, and shall post the report in the same manner that proposed ordinances are posted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a majority of voters voting on the question answer in the affirmative, the secretary of state shall cause a bill to divide the town into representative districts to be submitted to the general court at the next legislative session.  Upon passage of the bill and the signing of the bill into law, the town shall be deemed divided into the approved districts for the next succeeding election of representatives to the general court and all subsequent elections until the completion of the next decennial census and reapportionment of the general court.  If legislation adopting the town's proposed districts is not enacted by the general court in the next succeeding session of the general court, no further action or approval by the town is required for future introduction of legislation adopting the districts approved by the town pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a majority of the voters voting on the question do not answer in the affirmative, the town shall continue as a multi-member district for the purposes of electing representatives to the general court and reapportionment of the general court.
