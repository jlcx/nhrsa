&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any annual school district meeting under an article in the warrant placed there by petition, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of having 2-year or 3-year terms for the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer.  If the school district has adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of changing the terms of the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer from one year to (here insert term option) years, beginning with the terms of the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer to be elected at next year's regular school district meeting?''  Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the school district has not adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used to determine the vote of the school district.  If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of 2-year or 3-year terms, at the next annual meeting after the vote of approval, the school district shall elect a school district clerk, moderator and treasurer for 2-year or 3-year terms in accordance with the results of such vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After the 2-year or 3-year terms for school district clerk, moderator and treasurer have been established, at any annual school district meeting held the year before the end of the 2-year or 3-year term, under an article in the warrant placed there by petition, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of changing the 2-year or 3-year terms for the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer.  If the school district has adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of changing the terms of the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer from (here insert term option) years to (here insert term option) year(s), beginning with the terms of the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer who shall be elected at next year's regular school district meeting?''  The question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the school district has not adopted an official ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used to determine the vote of the school district.  If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of changing the terms, at the next annual school district meeting, the voters shall elect the clerk, moderator and treasurer in accordance with the result of such vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The terms of the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer shall all be for one year, for 2 years, or for 3 years.  The terms of only one or 2 of such officers shall not be changed independently of the other one or 2 officers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The power of choosing one year, 2-year, or 3-year terms for the school district clerk, moderator and treasurer shall not extend to any other officers of the school district.
