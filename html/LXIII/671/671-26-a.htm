&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 671:26-a Coordinating Certain Town and School District Elections. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
To facilitate voting for future annual meetings, to reduce costs, and to best accommodate the voters of the town, the legislative body of a town, which has not adopted the official ballot referendum form of meeting, although the school district has adopted the official ballot referendum form of meeting, may authorize coordination of future town elections with the school district elections.  The joint elections shall be held at a time and place determined by, and shall be supervised by, the election officials of the town, as provided in RSA 671:26.  The town and the school board shall allocate the costs of the joint elections in the same manner as in previous years, or as mutually agreed upon by the governing body of the town and the school board.
