<codesect>
A warrant for the school district election shall be posted by the school board, in the same manner as the selectmen for town elections as provided in RSA 669:2;  provided that, in a cooperative school district, a copy of the warrant shall be posted in at least one public place in each preexisting district, as well as at the place of meeting.  If a school board shall unreasonably neglect or refuse to warn an election, a justice of superior court, upon petition of 10 or more voters, or  1/10 of the voters of the district, whichever is less, may issue such warrant and cause it to be posted.
