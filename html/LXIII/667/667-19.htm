&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 667:19 Filling Vacancies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal from a district of a delegate may be filled by a special election held in the district.  The special election may be held on the same day on which another meeting of the town or ward is held or at a different time.  However, if the special election is held in a representative district having more than one town, ward or unincorporated place, the election must be held on the same day throughout the district.  An article for the election of a delegate shall be inserted in the warrants calling the meeting.  All laws relating to the election of representatives to the general court, so far as they are applicable, apply to the special election to fill the vacancy in the office of delegate.
