&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
At every state primary election, the voters in each state representative district shall elect delegates to each state party convention.  In order to be elected as a delegate to a state party convention, a person shall be a registered voter of the same party in the district from which the person is to be elected, and shall receive either a minimum of 10 votes or 10 percent of the votes cast in the district from which the person is to be elected, whichever is less.  A person who is entitled to serve as a delegate because he or she has been nominated for office as provided in RSA 667:21 shall not be entitled to serve as an elected delegate under this section, and the next highest eligible vote-getter shall be elected.
