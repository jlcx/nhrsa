My name is ____________________. I am today registering to vote in the city/ 
 town of ____________________, New Hampshire. 
 I understand that to vote in this city/town, I must be at least 18 
 years of age, I must be a United States citizen, and I must be domiciled in 
 this city/town. 
 I understand that a person can claim only one state and one city/town 
 as his or her domicile at a time. A domicile is that place, to which upon 
 temporary absence, a person has the intention of returning. By registering or
 voting today, I am acknowledging that I am not domiciled or voting in any 
 other state or any other city/town. 
 In declaring New Hampshire as my domicile, I am subject to the laws of 
 the state of New Hampshire which apply to all residents, including laws 
 requiring a driver to register a motor vehicle and apply for a New 
 Hampshire's driver's license within 60 days of becoming a resident. 
 In declaring New Hampshire as my domicile, I realize that I am not 
 qualified to vote in the state or federal elections in another state. 
 If I have any questions as to whether I am entitled to vote in this 
 city/town, I am aware that a supervisor of the checklist is available to 
 address my questions or concerns. 
 I acknowledge that I have read and understand the above qualifications 
 for voting and do hereby swear, under the penalties for voting fraud set 
 forth below, that I am qualified to vote in the above-stated city/ town, and,
 if registering on election day, that I have not voted and will not vote at 
 any other polling place this election.

 vote or voting is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000.
