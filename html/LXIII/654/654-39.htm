Whenever a person is reregistered, his or her party designation, if any, on the checklist undergoing revision shall not be changed except as provided in RSA 654:34.

III. Beginning June 1 of such year, the supervisors shall review the checklist and shall strike therefrom the names of all persons who have not registered or reregistered under paragraphs I and IV;  provided, that there shall not be stricken from said checklist the name of any person duly qualified to vote unless such person, not less than 30 days prior to such action, shall have been sent notice by the supervisors at his last known address of his failure to reregister stating the procedure to be followed in order to reregister and have his name retained on said checklist nor unless such person shall have been given a reasonable opportunity to follow said procedure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed reregistered and need not appear before the supervisors if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person voted in any election within the 4 years immediately preceding a 10-year verification;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person has been added to the checklist since the last state general election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Upon completion of verification of the checklist, but in no event later than September 1, the supervisors shall file with the secretary of state the following certificate:  We, the supervisors of the checklist (or registrars of voters) of the town (or ward __________) of __________, do hereby certify that we have verified the checklist of registered voters in the town (or ward __________ of the city) of __________, pursuant to the provisions of RSA 654:39.
