When the supervisors of the checklist receive a registration form from the town or city clerk or when an applicant submits the form to said supervisors in person at a session for the correction of the checklist, the supervisors of the checklist shall cause his or her name to be added to the checklist, unless it is established that it is more likely than not that the applicant is not qualified to vote in the city or town under RSA 654:1 through 654:6.  All decisions of the supervisors of the checklist shall be made by majority vote thereof.
