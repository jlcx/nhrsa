<codesect>
The secretary of state shall issue and distribute guidelines for the composition and style of checklists and for the maintenance of data related to checklists by which the supervisors of the checklist shall compile and correct the checklist.  Such guidelines shall specify the information which will be maintained and updated by the supervisors.  The secretary shall establish standard forms and procedures for the use of the supervisors for the maintenance of such information.  The information to be maintained and updated shall include the full name, domicile address, mailing address, and party affiliation, if any, of each voter on the checklist and such other information as the secretary requires.  Every checklist used at any election shall contain the full name, domicile address, mailing address, and party affiliation, if any, of each voter on the checklist.  The paper checklists used by ballot clerks on election day need not include mailing addresses.  The name and address of a voter shall not appear on the checklist at the request of the voter if the voter presents to the supervisors of the checklist a valid protective order pursuant to RSA 173-B.  The name, domicile address, and mailing address, if different, of such a voter shall be maintained on a separate list of voters, which shall be nonpublic and not subject to RSA 91-A.  If it is necessary to establish such a nonpublic list, the public checklist shall be marked at the end with a notation of the number of voters whose names are maintained on the nonpublic list.
