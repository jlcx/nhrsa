<codesect>
If the supervisors of the checklist receive a report from the United States Postal Service or the department of safety directly or as communicated by the secretary of state through the centralized voter registration database that a voter has permanently changed his or her address to another town, city, or state, they shall strike that name from the checklist at the next session for the correction of the checklist.  The supervisors of the checklist shall retain the report in accordance with RSA 33-A:3-a.  As an alternative, the supervisors of the checklist may first send a 30-day notice letter and then shall remove the name from the checklist if the voter does not respond to that notice as set forth in RSA 654:44.
