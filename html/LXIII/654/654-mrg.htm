I. Every inhabitant of the state, having a single established domicile for voting purposes, being a citizen of the United States, of the age provided for in Article 11 of Part First of the Constitution of New Hampshire, shall have a right at any meeting or election, to vote in the town, ward, or unincorporated place in which he or she is domiciled.  An inhabitant's domicile for voting purposes is that one place where a person, more than any other place, has established a physical presence and manifests an intent to maintain a single continuous presence for domestic, social, and civil purposes relevant to participating in democratic self-government.  A person has the right to change domicile at any time, however a mere intention to change domicile in the future does not, of itself, terminate an established domicile before the person actually moves.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. A student of any institution of learning may lawfully claim domicile for voting purposes in the New Hampshire town or city in which he or she lives while attending such institution of learning if such student's claim of domicile otherwise meets the requirements of RSA 654:1, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any elected or appointed official for whom one of the qualifications for his or her position is eligibility to be a voter in the area represented or served shall be considered to have resigned if the official moves his or her domicile so that he or she can no longer qualify to be a voter in the area represented or served.  Any vacancy so created shall be filled as prescribed by law.

<codesect>
A domicile for voting purposes acquired by any person in any town shall not be interrupted or lost by a temporary absence therefrom with the intention of returning thereto as his or her domicile.  Domicile for the purpose of voting as defined in RSA 654:1, once existing, continues to exist until another such domicile is gained.  Domicile for purposes of voting is a question of fact and intention.  A voter can have only one domicile for these purposes.  No person shall be deemed to have lost a domicile by reason of his or her presence or absence while the voter or his or her spouse is employed in the service of the United States;  nor while engaged in the navigation of the waters of the United States or of the high seas;  nor while a teacher in or student of any seminary of learning;  nor while confined in any public prison or other penal institution;  nor while a patient or confined for any reason in any nursing, convalescent home or hospital, old folks or old age home, or like institution or private facility.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The supervisors may refuse to add the name of an applicant to the checklist if he or she fails to present the evidence or an affidavit as required by this section.  Without limiting the acceptance of other forms of proof of domicile or identity deemed reasonable by the supervisors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any one of the following documents is presumptive evidence that the individual seeking to vote meets the domicile requirement, provided the document is currently valid, was issued to or in the name of the applicant, and shows the address the applicant claims as a domicile:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) New Hampshire driver's license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) New Hampshire vehicle registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Armed services identification, or other photo identification issued by the United States government.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any one of the following is presumptive evidence of the identity of an applicant sufficient to satisfy the identity requirement for an official authorized by RSA 659:30 to take the oath of an applicant swearing to a qualified voter, domicile, or election day affidavit or a sworn statement on the general election day voter registration form:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Photo driver's license issued by any state or the federal government.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) United States passport, armed services identification, or other photo identification issued by the United States government.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Photo identification issued by local or state government.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The presumptions established in this paragraph may be defeated by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the applicant is not qualified as a voter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To prove the qualifications set forth in paragraphs I and II, an applicant for registration as a voter must prove his or her identity to establish that the evidence used to prove age, citizenship, and domicile relate to the applicant.  A person who has in his or her immediate possession a photo identification approved for use by paragraph II must present that identification when applying for registration.  A person who does not have an approved photo identification with him or her may establish identity through completion of the qualified voter affidavit, which shall be retained in accordance with RSA 33-A:3-a, or a sworn statement on the general election day voter registration form.  Residents of a nursing home or similar facility may prove their identity through verification of identity by the administrator of the facility or by his or her designee.  For the purposes of this section, the application of a person whose identity has been verified by an official of a nursing home or similar facility shall be treated in the same manner as the application of a person who proved his or her identity with a photo identification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person who is applying for registration as a voter and who is currently registered to vote in a different town or ward in New Hampshire shall complete the voter registration form provided for in RSA 654:7.  If the election official receiving the application confirms through the centralized voter registration database required by RSA 654:45 that the applicant is currently registered to vote in New Hampshire, the applicant shall prove identity and domicile, but shall not be required to prove his or her age or citizenship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The election official approving the application for registration as voter of a person who does not present an approved form of photo identification as proof of identity when registering, shall mark the voter registration form to indicate that no photo identification was presented and shall inform the person that, if he or she is a first-time election day registrant in New Hampshire, he or she will receive a letter of identity verification.  The person entering the voter information into the centralized voter registration database shall determine if the person is listed in the system as having been previously registered in the town or ward reported by the applicant on the voter registration form.  If the person is a new registrant who has not been previously registered anywhere in New Hampshire or if the centralized voter registration database does not confirm a previous registration claimed on the voter registration form, the election official shall cause the record created in the centralized voter registration database to indicate that the person is a new applicant in New Hampshire and that no photo identification was presented.  When municipalities enter information on people who register on election day into the centralized voter registration database, to the extent practical applicants who are registering for the first time in New Hampshire and who also register without presenting an approved photo identification shall be entered first.  The person entering the voter information of election day residents into the centralized voter registration database shall cause the records to indicate if the voter executed a domicile affidavit or a sworn statement on the general election day voter registration form.

(b) The secretary of state shall cause a letter of identity verification to be mailed by first class mail to each voter identified at any election as a first-time election day registrant in New Hampshire who also did not verify his or her identity with an approved photo identification.  The letter shall be mailed within 60 days after the election, except that if the election is a state primary election, the letter shall be mailed 60 days after the general election, and if the election is a regularly scheduled municipal election, the letter shall be mailed by the July 1 or January 1 next following the election.  The secretary of state shall mark the envelope with instructions to the United States Post Office not to forward the letter and to provide address correction information.  The letter shall notify the person that a person who was unable to present photo identification registered or registered and voted using his or her name and address and instruct the person to return the letter within 45 days with a written confirmation that the person registered and voted or to contact the attorney general immediately if he or she did not register and vote.  Any voter under a protective order pursuant to RSA 173-B, and whose name does not appear on the checklist as provided under RSA 654:25, shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph V.

(b) The secretary of state shall cause a letter of identity verification to be mailed by first class mail to each voter identified at any election as a first-time election day registrant in New Hampshire who also did not verify his or her identity with an approved photo identification.  The letter shall be mailed by January 10 in every odd-numbered year in the case of persons registering at a state primary or general election, or within 90 days after any other election.  The secretary of state shall mark the envelope with instructions to the United States Post Office not to forward the letter and to provide address correction information.  The letter shall notify the person that a person who was unable to present photo identification registered or registered and voted using his or her name and address and instruct the person to return the letter within 45 days with a written confirmation that the person registered and voted or to contact the attorney general immediately if he or she did not register and vote.  Any voter under a protective order pursuant to RSA 173-B, and whose name does not appear on the checklist as provided under RSA 654:25, shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The secretary of state shall cause any letters mailed pursuant to subparagraph (b) that are returned as undeliverable by the United States Post Office to be referred to the attorney general.  The secretary of state shall also prepare and forward to the attorney general a list of all persons who were mailed letters under subparagraph (b) and have not confirmed their registration.  Upon receipt of notice from a person who receives a letter of identity verification that the person did not register and vote, or upon receipt of a referral from the secretary of state, the attorney general shall cause an investigation to be made to determine whether fraudulent registration or voting occurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Within 90 days of each election, the secretary of state shall cause a list of persons executing domicile affidavits and sworn statements on the general election day voter registration form since the prior election to be forwarded to the attorney general and the division of motor vehicles.  The secretary of state shall send a letter to each such person informing him or her of a driver's obligation to obtain a New Hampshire driver's license within 60 days of becoming a New Hampshire resident.  The letter shall be mailed within 60 days after the election, except that if the election is a state primary election, the letter shall be mailed 60 days after the general election, and if the election is a regularly scheduled municipal election, the letter shall be mailed by the July 1 or January 1 next following the election.  The secretary of state shall mark the envelope with instructions to the United States Post Office not to forward the letter and to provide address correction information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The secretary of state shall cause any letters mailed pursuant to subparagraph (d) that are returned as undeliverable by the United States Post Office to be referred to the attorney general and the attorney general shall cause an investigation to be made to determine whether fraudulent registration or voting occurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Upon completion of any investigation authorized under this section, the attorney general shall forward a report summarizing the results of the investigation to the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, and the chairpersons of the appropriate house and senate standing committees with jurisdiction over election law.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 654:31 Availability of Checklist and Voter Information. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Checklist information'' means the data, in any form, required to be placed on the public checklist by RSA 654:25, when that data is obtained or derived from a checklist or from the statewide centralized voter registration database maintained by the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Commercial purposes'' means knowingly using, selling, giving, or receiving the checklist information for the purpose of selling or offering for sale any property or service unrelated to an election or political campaign.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In towns and cities, the public checklist as corrected by the supervisors shall be open for the examination of any person at all times before the opening of a meeting or election at which the list is to be used.  The supervisors of the checklist or city or town clerk shall furnish one or more copies of the most recent public checklist of their town or city to any person requesting such copies.  The supervisors of the checklist or city or town clerk may only provide checklist information for their town or city.  The supervisors of the checklist or city or town clerk shall charge a fee of $25 for each copy of the public checklist for a town or ward.  For public checklists containing more than 2,500 names, the supervisors of the checklist or city or town clerk shall charge a fee of $25, plus $0.50 per thousand names or portion thereof in excess of 2,500, plus any shipping costs.  The supervisors of the checklist or city or town clerk may provide public checklist information on paper, computer disk, computer tape, electronic transfer, or any other form.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The secretary of state shall, upon request, provide to a political party, as defined in RSA 664:2, IV, or to a political committee, as defined in RSA 664:2, III, a list of the name, domicile address, mailing address, town or city, voter history, and party affiliation, if any, of every registered voter in the state.  The secretary of state shall, upon request, provide to a candidate for county, state, or federal office a list of the name, domicile address, mailing address, town or city, voter history, and party affiliation, if any, of every registered voter in the state or in the candidate's district.  In this section, "voter history'' means whether the person voted and, for primary elections, in which party's primary the person voted, in each state election for the preceding 2 years.  The secretary of state shall charge a fee of $25 plus $0.50 per thousand names or portion thereof in excess of 2,500 plus shipping charges for each copy of the list provided under this section.  In addition, the secretary of state shall charge and collect on behalf of and remit to the supervisors of the checklist of each city and town the amount that such supervisors would have charged had the public checklist of their city or town been purchased from them.  The secretary of state may provide lists as prescribed in this section on paper, computer disk, computer tape, electronic transfer, or any other form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except for fees collected on behalf of a city or town, fees collected by the secretary of state under this section shall be deposited in the election fund established pursuant to RSA 5:6-d.

VI. No person shall use or permit the use of checklist or voter information provided by any supervisors of the checklist or city or town clerk or by the secretary of state for commercial purposes.  Whoever knowingly violates any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if a natural person or guilty of a felony if any other person.  The secretary of state may insert inauthentic entries into copies of the public checklist provided under this section for purposes of facilitating enforcement of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. This section shall not be construed to restrict the transfer of checklist information to the state or federal courts as required by RSA 654:45 for any lawful purpose.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Change of registration of a voter whose party membership has been previously registered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any legal voter whose party membership has been registered may change such registration by appearing in person before the supervisors of the checklist for his town or ward any time they meet, except as prohibited by paragraph IV, and stating to them under oath or affirmation, if required, that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) He intends to affiliate with and generally supports the candidates of the party with which he offers to register, in which case he shall be registered as a member of such party;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) He does not wish to be registered as a member of any party, in which case his party designation shall be removed from the checklist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) He may also change such registration at any primary, upon making oath or affirmation to the same effect, but he shall not be permitted in such case to vote the ballot of any party at such primary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Change of registration of a voter who has been registered as an undeclared voter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any legal voter who has been registered as an undeclared voter may register as a member of the party of the voter's choice by appearing before the supervisors of the checklist for the voter's town or ward any time they meet, except as prohibited by paragraph IV, and stating to them, under oath or affirmation, if required, that the voter intends to affiliate with and generally supports the candidates of the party with which the voter offers to register, in which case the voter shall be registered as a member of such party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A voter may also register as a member of a party at any primary by requesting to be registered as a member and voting the ballot of the party of the voter's choice.  A voter may also register once again as an undeclared voter after voting in a primary as a registered member of a party by returning the card or signing the list of undeclared voters from the statewide centralized voter registration database provided for in paragraph V.  If cards are used, the voter shall return the card to the person at the polls designated by the town or city clerk to accept the card.  All such cards and lists shall be in the possession of the supervisors of the checklist at the close of the polls on election day.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any provision of paragraphs I and II to the contrary, no person who has voted in a primary may thereafter on the day of said primary change the person's party registration, unless, prior to voting in the primary, the person was registered as an undeclared voter, in which case the person may once again register as an undeclared voter, as provided in subparagraph II(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No person, who is already registered to vote, whether his party membership has been previously registered or not, shall affiliate with a party or disaffiliate from a party between the first Wednesday in June and the day before the state primary election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) At any primary, the supervisors of the checklist shall make available within the polling place a card or list of undeclared voters from the statewide centralized voter registration database to enable a voter who was registered as an undeclared voter but who changed registration on the day of the primary in order to vote as a registered member of a party to change registration so that the voter is registered once again as an undeclared voter.  The card or list shall be in substantially the following form:
<PRE>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Between April 1 and August 1 in the next even-numbered year, the supervisors shall advertise notice of their sessions at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the town or city and hold sufficient sessions for verification of the checklist as in their opinion will enable all eligible voters in said town or ward to appear before them and register or reregister as the case may be.  Whenever a person is reregistered, his party designation, if any, on the checklist undergoing revision shall not be changed except as provided in RSA 654:34.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon completion of verification of the checklist, but, in no event later than September 1, the supervisors shall file with the secretary of state the following certificate:  We, the supervisors of the checklist of the town (or ward ___) of ___, do hereby certify that we have verified the checklist of registered voters in the town (or ward ___ of the city) of ___ as directed by the ballot law commission.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The supervisors may appoint such temporary assistant supervisors as may be necessary, but who shall have none of the powers and duties of supervisors.

I. The secretary of state is authorized to plan, develop, equip, establish, site, and maintain a statewide centralized voter registration database and communications system, hereinafter referred to as the voter database, connecting users throughout the state.  The voter database shall include the current information on the voter registration forms, the accepted absentee ballot applications, the voter checklists, and voter actions as recorded on the marked checklist maintained by each city, ward, and town in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any election official in the state authorized by this chapter to have direct access to the voter database may obtain immediate electronic access to the information contained in the voter database related to individuals registered or registering to vote in the election official's jurisdiction.  The office of the clerk is hereby designated as a database access point for each town or city.  The secretary of state may authorize additional database access points in a town or city, including election day access points at polling places.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An electronic communications system that provides access for election officials from at least one point in each city and town within the state.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An interactive computer program allowing local election officials access to records contained in the database with a process to add, delete, modify, or print a voter registration record related to the election official's jurisdiction.  The system shall be designed so that there can be regular updates to the database, the records reflect the name of each registered voter with no duplication, and the names of ineligible voters are removed.  The system shall contain safeguards to ensure that the names of properly registered voters are not removed in error.
<br>

(b) Voter database record data shall be verified by matching the records with those of the department of safety and the federal social security administration as are required by law, and with the records of the state agency or division charged with maintaining vital records.  For this purpose the voter registration record database may be linked to the state agency or division charged with maintaining vital records and the department of safety, provided that no linked agency or division may save or retain voter information or use it for purposes other than verifying the accuracy of the information contained in the voter database.  The link authorized by this subparagraph shall not allow the department of state or election officials direct access to the motor vehicle registration or driver's license records maintained by the division of motor vehicles.  The commissioner of safety may authorize the release of information from motor vehicle registration and driver's license records to the extent that the information is necessary to department of state and department of safety cooperation in a joint notification to individuals of apparent discrepancies in their records and to the extent that the information is necessary to resolve those discrepancies.  The commissioner of safety and the secretary of state are authorized to enter into an agreement that establishes the services to be provided by the department of safety and the cost for those services.  The department of safety shall not be required to provide any services under this subparagraph unless an agreement is in place and there are sufficient funds in the election fund to pay the cost for the services.  The system shall facilitate the identification and correction of voter registration records whenever a registered voter has died or has been disenfranchised pursuant to part I, article 11 of the New Hampshire constitution or RSA 654:5 through RSA 654:6, or when the domicile address does not match the address provided by the same individual to the department of safety.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Access by local election officials to the voter database shall be limited to the supervisors of the checklist, city registrars and deputy registrars, and town or city clerks and their deputies, as determined by the secretary of state.  Access by local election officials shall be subject to the limitations of paragraph VI, and shall be limited to the records of individuals who are currently registered to vote in the official's jurisdiction and individuals who are applying to register to vote in the official's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The secretary of state shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The voter checklist for a town or city shall be available pursuant to RSA 654:31.  Any person who discloses information from the voter database in any manner not authorized by this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
