&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 654:2 Temporary Absence. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A domicile for voting purposes acquired by any person in any town shall not be interrupted or lost by a temporary absence therefrom with the intention of returning thereto as his or her domicile.  Domicile for the purpose of voting as defined in RSA 654:1, once existing, continues to exist until another such domicile is gained.  Domicile for purposes of voting is a question of fact and intention.  A voter can have only one domicile for these purposes.  No person shall be deemed to have lost a domicile by reason of his or her presence or absence while employed in the service of the United States;  nor while engaged in the navigation of the waters of the United States or of the high seas;  nor while a teacher in or student of any seminary of learning;  nor while confined in any public prison or other penal institution;  nor while a patient or confined for any reason in any nursing, convalescent home or hospital, old folks or old age home, or like institution or private facility.
