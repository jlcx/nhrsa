&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 669:13 Non-Partisan Official Ballot System. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A town may vote to adopt the non-partisan official ballot system for election of town officers under an article in the warrant for any town meeting, and may rescind such action in like manner.  In any town in which the partisan ballot system is in effect, and which has a population, according to most recent federal census, of 4,500 or more, adoption of the non-partisan ballot system shall be by ballot.  Whenever in such town there shall appear in the warrant for any town meeting an article relating to the adoption of the non-partisan ballot system, the town clerk shall cause to be printed on the official ballot, if any, otherwise upon a ballot specially prepared for the purpose, the question, "Shall the non-partisan ballot system for the election of town officers be adopted by this town?'', which question shall be followed by boxes in which the voter may indicate "Yes'' or "No''.  If the majority of the qualified voters present and voting at such meeting shall answer said question in the affirmative, the non-partisan ballot system shall be deemed to have been adopted by said town.  In all towns, the non-partisan ballot system shall not be in effect until the town election first following the meeting at which such system is adopted.  A plurality shall elect in towns using the non-partisan ballot system.
