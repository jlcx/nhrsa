<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I of this section, any town which has adopted a municipal charter under the provisions of RSA 49-B:1-6 may establish the second Tuesday in March, the second Tuesday in May, or the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in odd-numbered years as the date for the election of town officers.

III. No town election shall be held in conjunction with the biennial election.

Such local political subdivision may, in addition, vote to hold the second session of its annual meeting, for transacting all business not required to be voted on by official ballot, within 2 weeks of the election date at a time and date determined by the governing body.  The joint elections shall be held at a time and place determined by, and shall be supervised by, the election officials of the local political subdivision, coordinated as set forth in RSA 671:25 and RSA 671:26, with costs allocated in the same manner as in previous years or as may be mutually agreed upon by the governing bodies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 669:2 Warrant. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The selectmen shall include as part of the warrant for the annual town meeting a warrant for each annual town election which shall prescribe the place, day and hour of the election, the officers to be elected, and the questions to be submitted to the voters.  In a town which has adopted an official ballot system for the election of town officers, the warrant shall specify the time the polls are open and the hour before which the polls may not close.

In a town which has not adopted an official ballot system, it shall be sufficient for a town meeting warrant to list items to be taken up at the town business meeting, including the election of town officers.

The validity of any actions taken by a person who assumes office pursuant to this section and is later removed as a result of an appeal may not be challenged on the basis that the person was subsequently removed as a result of the appeal.

Upon receipt of his ballot from the moderator, each voter shall write thereon the name of every person for whom he desires to vote.  Each voter shall deliver his ballot to the moderator in open meeting;  and the moderator, on receiving the ballot, shall direct the town clerk to check the name of the voter on the checklist, and shall, without inspecting the name of any person voted for, examine the ballot so far only as to determine whether the same contains more than one ballot;  if it does not, he shall place the ballot in the ballot box;  but if it does, he shall make it manifest to the meeting and reject the same unless the voter shall correct his ballot.

<center><h2>Filling of Vacancies</h2></center>

<center><h3>Section 669:61</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 669:61 Vacancies in Town Offices. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever a vacancy as defined in RSA 652:12 occurs in any elective town office or whenever a town neglects or refuses to fill an elective town office, said vacancy shall be filled by the action of that body or person authorized by law to appoint or elect such officer for a term ending upon the election and qualification of his successor, unless otherwise provided.  Unless otherwise provided, at said next annual town election, the voters of the town shall then elect an officer for the full term provided by law or the balance of an unexpired term provided by law, as the case may be.  If a town then refuses or neglects to fill said office, a vacancy shall be deemed again to exist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to empower a town to find that a vacancy exists, in the case of a contested election or recount, until the rendering of a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the ballot law commission as to such contested election in accordance with RSA 652:12, V, or until the recount has been concluded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purposes of paragraph I, and with respect to those offices elected by official, non-partisan ballot, the term "next annual town election'' shall mean the next annual town election for which the nomination filing period, as set forth in RSA 669:19, begins subsequent to the occurrence of the vacancy.  Any vacancy which occurs between the beginning of the filing period and the town election shall not be filled by official ballot until the annual town election the following year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The legislative body of a town may adopt or rescind the optional procedure in this paragraph for filling vacancies in elective town offices.  If the authorized person or body does not make an appointment to fill the vacancy pursuant to paragraph I within 45 days after at least one legally-qualified person has applied in writing for such appointment, then upon the filing of a petition with the selectmen signed by the number of voters required under RSA 39:3 for the warning of a special town meeting, presented not less than 90 days before the next annual town meeting, the selectmen shall call a special election to fill the vacancy.  The special election shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 39:3 and other applicable provisions governing town elections.  The person elected at the special election shall serve for a term ending upon the election and qualification of his or her successor.  Unless otherwise provided, at the next annual town election, the voters of the town shall elect an officer for the full term provided by law or the balance of an unexpired term provided by law, as the case may be.  If the town then refuses or neglects to fill the office, a vacancy shall be deemed again to exist.
