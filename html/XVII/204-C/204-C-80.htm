<codesect>
The purpose of this subdivision is to establish a homeless prevention program and a fund therefor to be used to provide housing assistance on behalf of very low income persons and families in order to help them meet their housing costs, thereby preventing homelessness resulting from their inability to meet such costs, and to maximize the opportunity for homeless families and individuals to obtain housing in the private market.  This subdivision is also intended to assist persons and families who are receiving public assistance or have recently graduated from public assistance to low wage jobs and persons with disabilities to enable them to afford decent, safe housing.
