&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 204-C:37 Trust Agreements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In the discretion of the authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state.  Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received or proceeds of any mortgage or mortgages pledged and may convey or mortgage the assets of the authority or any portion of such assets.  Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.  Any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.  All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the authority.
