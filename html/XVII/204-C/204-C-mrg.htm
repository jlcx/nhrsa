Prior to making any mortgage loan or any loan to a lending institution, or prior to purchasing any loan or mortgage loan under this chapter, the authority shall find with respect to each such commitment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. That, with respect to rental multi-family housing, eligible elderly and low income persons and families can afford the adjusted rental or carrying charges set for a reasonable number, as determined by the authority, but in no event fewer than  1/8 of the units in the housing, to be financed pursuant to such commitment without the expenditure of more than 30 percent of their annual income for basic shelter cost, including the additional cost, if any, of heat, hot water, and other utilities, except telephone;  provided, however, that, if necessary to make the project financially feasible, such percentage of annual income may be increased to 32 percent;  and provided further that, if, in order to meet federal requirements or to obtain federal assistance, a different percentage of annual income shall be required, then such percentage of annual income shall be increased, or based on the federal requirement, if applicable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. That with respect to housing other than rental multi-family housing, that the general housing market area, as determined by the authority, to be served by such housing does or shall by reason of the housing to be provided include housing for eligible elderly or low income persons and families, as well as eligible persons and families;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. That there exists a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations at rents or carrying charges which eligible persons and families including eligible elderly and low income persons and families can afford within the general housing market area, as determined by the authority, to be served by such housing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. That without the assistance contemplated by such commitment, private enterprise cannot supply such housing in such general housing market area at rentals or carrying charges which eligible persons and families can afford;  and at which eligible elderly and low income persons and families can afford without the expenditure of more than 30 percent of their income for basic shelter cost, including the additional cost, if any, of heat, hot water, and other utilities, except telephone;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. That as to any loan to a lending institution or purchase of a loan or mortgage loan, an inadequate supply of funds for housing loans or mortgage loans exists in normal banking channels within the state and available to the general housing area;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. That such housing either is itself designed to house eligible elderly and low income persons and families and eligible persons and families of varied economic means or shall not create or contribute to an undue concentration of low income families in one neighborhood;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. That the housing to be financed by the authority pursuant to such commitment shall increase the supply of or promote the quality of decent, safe and sanitary housing for eligible persons and families, including a reasonable number, as determined by the authority, of eligible elderly and low income persons and families and shall be of public use and provide a public benefit;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. That such housing shall be undertaken, and the eligible mortgagor, eligible person and family or lending institution regulated, pursuant to the rules of the authority and subject to this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. That the authority's estimate of its revenues from the financing of such housing, together with all subsidies, grants or other financial assistance from governmental agencies or other sources to be received in connection with such housing, shall equal in the aggregate the amount estimated by the authority as necessary for debt service on its bonds and notes to be issued for the purpose of financing such housing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 204-C:40 Reserve Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The authority may create and establish one or more special funds, hereafter referred to as "bond reserve funds'', and shall pay into each such bond reserve fund any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purpose of such fund;  any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions of the authority authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes;  and any other moneys which may be available to the authority for the purpose of such fund from any other source or sources.  All moneys held in any bond reserve fund are hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds with respect to which such bond reserve fund may be established, as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided.  Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made and the revenues, moneys or property so pledged subject to RSA 204-C:33.  The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such bond reserve fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement.  Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such bond reserve fund shall be a fund for all such bonds issued to finance housing without distinction or priority of any bond over another;  provided the authority in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such bond reserve fund shall be the fund for particular housing and for the bonds issued to finance particular housing and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of bonds having a subordinate lien in respect of the security authorized to other bonds of the authority and, in such case, the authority may create separate or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Moneys in any bond reserve fund shall not be withdrawn from at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such fund to less than the bond reserve fund requirement established for such fund, as provided in paragraph IV, except for the purpose of making, with respect to bonds secured in whole or in part by such fund, payment when due of principal, interest, redemption premiums and the sinking fund payments, if any, with respect to such bonds for the payment of which other moneys of the authority are not available.  Any income or interest earned by any bond reserve fund resulting from the investment of such bond may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority to the extent it does not reduce the amount of that bond reserve fund below the bond reserve fund requirement for such fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The authority shall not at any time issue bonds, secured in whole or in part by a bond reserve fund, if upon the issuance of such bonds, the amount in such bond reserve fund will be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for such fund, unless the authority at the time of issuance of such bonds shall deposit in such fund from the proceeds of the bonds issued, or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in such fund, shall not be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for such fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In this section, "bond reserve fund requirement'' means, as of any particular date of computation, an amount of money, as provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the bonds or notes with respect to which such fund is established.  In computing the amount of the bond reserve funds for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of such funds shall be invested shall be valued in such manner as the authority by resolution shall determine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 204-C:57 Fund Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established within the authority an affordable housing fund.  All revenues collected from the sources described in RSA 204-C:59 or from government appropriations or grants shall be credited to the fund, but such revenues shall not be deemed to be money received on account of the state, and nothing in this subdivision shall be understood as pledging the faith and credit of the state.  Such funds shall be used by the authority to facilitate the purchase and rehabilitation or construction of affordable housing primarily for low and moderate income persons and families, as provided in paragraph II, and for pre-construction technical assistance to entities which undertake such efforts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority shall enter into contracts for grants and loans with eligible applicants according to standards and rules that the authority shall adopt and publish.  The authority shall make a good faith effort to approve applications from both for-profit and nonprofit organizations consistent with the criteria established in this paragraph.  However, when entering into contracts pursuant to this section, the authority shall give priority to the affordable housing projects which meet one or more of the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Projects containing the highest percentage of housing units which are affordable to low income people;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Projects containing the longest commitment to low-income people;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Projects containing the maximum number of units for low or moderate income families with children;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Projects which shall preserve the existing stock of low and moderate income housing.
<br>
No application from an eligible applicant shall be rejected solely or primarily because a greater level of assistance will be required to make the proposal feasible due to market conditions prevailing in the geographical area as opposed to other areas of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In granting assistance pursuant to paragraph II, the authority shall make all reasonable efforts to assure that all geographic areas from which there are proposals satisfying the criteria of paragraph II shall receive assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The authority shall not provide financial assistance under this subdivision to any project in which more than 50 percent of the units will not be affordable to persons of low or moderate income.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Prior to granting any assistance pursuant to RSA 204-C:57, II, the authority shall find with respect to each such commitment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That there exists a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing available at costs which low or moderate income persons can afford within the general housing market area, as determined by the authority;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That without the assistance contemplated by such commitment, private enterprise cannot supply such housing in such general housing market area at rentals or carrying charges which low or moderate income persons can afford without the expenditure of more than 30 percent of their income;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That the assistance contemplated shall preserve or increase the supply of decent, safe and sanitary housing for low or moderate income persons and shall be of public use and provide a public benefit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Loans made from the fund shall be for periods and terms to be determined by the authority.  Such loans may include, but shall not be limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Long-term mortgage loans to finance the total cost of a project or to supplement other available financing;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Short-term loans to supplement use of other funds, including tax-exempt bond proceeds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Prior to granting any assistance pursuant to 204-C:57, II for new construction, the authority shall hold a public hearing in the community in which the proposed project is to be located.

If the authority determines that the entity in charge of the project is not competent to carry the project forward but that the project is still worth completing, it may oust the entity and complete the project through such other means and agents and under such financial conditions as it determines to be in the public interest.
