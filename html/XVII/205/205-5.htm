&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 205:5 Land Available for Public or Private Agencies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The authority may make land in a redevelopment project available for use by private enterprise or public agencies in accordance with the redevelopment plan.  Such land may be made available at its use value, which represents the value (whether expressed in terms of rental or capital price) at which the authority determines such land should be made available in order that it may be developed or redeveloped for the purposes specified in such plan.  To assure that land acquired in a redevelopment project is used in accordance with the redevelopment plan, an authority, upon the sale or lease of such land, shall obligate purchasers or lessees:  (1) to use the land for the purpose designated in the redevelopment plan;  (2) to begin the building of their improvements within a period of time which the authority fixes as reasonable;  and (3) to comply with such other conditions as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.  Any such obligations by the purchaser shall be covenants and conditions running with the land where the authority so stipulates.
