&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 205:1-b Findings and Declaration of Necessity. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby found and declared that there exist in many communities within this state areas of vacant or predominantly vacant real property which are substandard or blighted for the reasons set forth in RSA 205:2-b;  that such areas constitute a serious and growing menace to the safety and health of the communities of this state;  that such areas are not being used at all or are being used in an unplanned, haphazard and piecemeal manner;  that such areas impair economic values, retard the provision of residential, commercial, industrial, institutional and recreational buildings and other improvements, impair the tax revenues in these communities and threaten the sources of public revenue and the financial stability of these communities, thus preventing the sound growth of these communities and the provision of new places of residence or employment for their citizens;  that the development or redevelopment of such areas in these communities in accordance with a comprehensive redevelopment plan is necessary to improve economic values, return important tax revenues, and provide additional places of residence or employment;  that the development or redevelopment of such areas cannot be achieved by the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids herein provided;  that the development or redevelopment of such areas are public purposes for which public monies may be expended and public uses for which the power of eminent domain and other governmental powers may be exercised, consistent with RSA 205:3-b;  that the development or redevelopment of such areas in accordance with an approved redevelopment plan will stimulate the investment of private capital, the construction of residential, commercial, industrial, institutional and recreational buildings and the provision of new sources of employment and will eliminate and prevent the recurrence of the existing substandard and blighted and blighting conditions now existing in such areas;  and the necessity in the public interest for these provisions is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.
