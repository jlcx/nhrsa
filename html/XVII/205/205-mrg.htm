&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 205:1 Finding and Declaration of Necessity. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby found and declared (a) that there exist in many communities within this state blighted areas for the reasons set forth in RSA 205:2-b;  (b) that such areas impair economic values and tax revenues;  that such areas cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health and safety of the residents of the state, that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities;  (c) that the clearance, replanning and preparation for rebuilding of these areas, and the prevention or the reduction of blight and its causes, are public purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired, consistent with this chapter, and are governmental functions of state concern;  (d) that there are also certain areas where the condition of the title, the diverse ownership of the real property to be assembled, the street or lot layouts, or other conditions prevent a proper development of the real property, and that it is in the public interest that such areas, as well as blighted areas, be acquired by eminent domain, consistent with this chapter, and made available for sound and wholesome development in accordance with a redevelopment plan, and that the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the financing of the acquisition and preparation of real property by a public agency for such redevelopment is likewise a public use justifying the use of the powers of eminent domain when exercised consistent with RSA 205:3-b and a public purpose for which public money may be expended and such other powers authorized;  (e) that redevelopment activities will stimulate residential construction which is closely correlated with general economic activity;  and that such undertakings authorized by this chapter will aid the production of better housing and more desirable neighborhoods and community development at lower costs and will make possible a more stable and larger volume of residential construction, which will assist materially in achieving and maintaining full employment;  and (f) that it is in the public interest that advance preparation for such projects and activities be made now, and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

It is hereby found and declared that (a) certain of the blighted areas may, through the means provided herein, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such manner that the conditions of blight may be eliminated, remedied or prevented and, to the extent feasible, the salvable blighted areas should be conserved and rehabilitated through voluntary action and the regulatory process, and (b) all powers conferred in this chapter are for public uses justifying the use of the powers of eminent domain when exercised consistent with RSA 205:3-b and public purposes for which public money may be expended and such other powers exercised, and the necessity in the public interest for these provisions is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

Any housing authority now or hereafter established pursuant to RSA 203 may carry out as a redevelopment project or as a part of a redevelopment project in any area in which a redevelopment project is determined to be necessary by a housing authority, any work or undertaking to develop or redevelop an area of vacant or predominantly vacant land which is substandard or blighted or in the process of becoming blighted (1) because it is unduly costly to develop or redevelop such an area through the ordinary operations of private enterprise (a) by reason of the existence of ledge, rock, unsuitable soil or other physical conditions or because of the necessity for unduly expensive excavation, fill or grading, or (b) by reason of the need for unduly expensive foundations, retaining walls or unduly expensive measures for waterproofing structures or for draining the area or for the prevention of the flooding thereof or for the protection of adjacent properties and the water table therein or for unduly expensive measures incident to building around or over rights-of-way through the area or for otherwise making the area appropriate for sound development, or (2) because obsolete, inappropriate or otherwise faulty platting or subdivision, division of the area by rights-of-way, diversity of ownership of plots, inadequacy of transportation facilities or other utilities, inadequacy of access to the area, tax and special assessment delinquencies, a substantial change in business or economic conditions or practices, a deterioration of site improvements or facilities, an abandonment or cessation of a previous use or of work on improvements begun but not feasible to complete without the aids provided by this chapter or any combination of the foregoing or other conditions in any such area which are not being remedied by the ordinary operations of private enterprise, result in any such area not being used at all or result in any such area being used in an unplanned, haphazard, or piecemeal manner with building on small parcels or sections of any such area without any overall plan or design, so that in essence any such area is detrimental to the safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth of the community in which it is situated.  The powers granted in this section are in amplification of and in addition to the powers granted in RSA 205:2 and 2-a, with respect to the inclusion of areas of vacant or predominantly vacant land in a redevelopment project.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph VI of RSA 203:3, the authority conferred by this section shall be exercised only within the territorial limits of the municipality for which the housing authority is created.

Any municipality may, in addition to the cooperation provided in RSA 203:23, authorize financing for any redevelopment project as provided in paragraphs I and II and may enter into an agreement with an authority relating to one or more redevelopment projects, which need not be contiguous nor undertaken simultaneously, to provide that the taxes raised by assessment on the taxable property included as part of a redevelopment project shall be divided as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In each year, that portion of the taxes for said year which would be raised from said taxable property (including taxable property added to a redevelopment project area by amendment of a redevelopment plan) by the rate at which the tax is assessed for said year by and for the municipality upon the initial valuation thereof in the tax year in which the redevelopment plan for the project was first approved, shall be allocated to the municipality as taxes by and for said municipality;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Of the taxes raised each year by the rate at which the tax is assessed for said year upon the actual valuation of the taxable property in the redevelopment project as shown upon the assessors' valuation books for that year, that portion which is in excess of the amount described in paragraph I hereof shall be allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid into a special fund of the authority for the payment of the principal of and interest on loans, moneys advanced to, or indebtedness (whether funded, refunded, assumed, or otherwise) incurred by such authority to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, such redevelopment project.  Unless and until the total sum of the valuations of the taxable property in the redevelopment project exceeds the initial valuation, all of the taxes raised from said property shall be allocated to the municipality as taxes by and for said municipality.  When such loans, advances, and indebtedness, if any, and interest thereof, have been paid or when the sums held in the special fund created hereby together with the interest thereon, are sufficient to make such payment, all moneys thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable property in such redevelopment project shall be allocated to the municipality as taxes by and for said municipality and the agreement shall in all respects terminate.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
