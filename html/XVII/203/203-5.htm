&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 203:5 Appointment, Qualifications and Tenure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the governing body of a municipality adopts a resolution as aforesaid, it shall promptly notify the mayor of such adoption.  Upon receiving such notice, the mayor shall appoint 5 persons as commissioners of the authority created for said municipality.  The commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, but thereafter commissioners shall be appointed as aforesaid for a term of office of 5 years except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.  Thereafter, a board of commissioners may request that the mayor appoint a sixth commissioner, who shall be a public housing resident or assisted housing participant within the programs administered by that board of commissioners.  Upon receiving such request, the mayor shall appoint a sixth commissioner.  Any such sixth resident commissioner shall serve for a term of 5 years with all of the powers and responsibilities of that position.  No commissioner of an authority may be a paid officer or employee of the municipality for which the authority is created.  A commissioner shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified.  A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.  A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his or her services, but shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his or her duties.  The powers of each authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof in office from time to time.  Three commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes.  Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number.  The mayor shall designate which of the commissioners appointed shall be the first chairperson, who shall serve in the capacity of chairperson until the expiration of his or her term of office as commissioner.  When the office of the chairperson of the authority thereafter becomes vacant, the authority shall select a chairperson from among its commissioners.  An authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice-chairperson, and it may employ a secretary (who shall be executive director), technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation.  For such legal services as it may require, an authority may call upon the chief law officer of the municipality or may employ its own counsel and legal staff.  An authority may delegate to one or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.
