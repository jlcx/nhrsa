&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 203:2 Finding and Declaration of Necessity. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared:  (a) that there exist in the state insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations and that persons of low income are forced to reside in such insanitary or unsafe accommodations;  that within the state there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations;  that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state and impair economic values;  that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities;  (b) that these areas in the state cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved, through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income (as herein defined) would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise;  (c) that the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which insanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern;  (d) that it is in the public interest that work on projects for such purposes be commenced as soon as possible in order to relieve the acute housing shortage which now constitutes an emergency;  and the necessity in the public interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted, is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 203:4 Creation of Housing Authority. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In each municipality, as herein defined, of the state there is hereby created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the housing authority of the municipality;  provided that such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers as hereunder until the governing body of the municipality by resolution adopted by majority vote of those present at any regular or special meeting shall have declared that there is need for an authority to function in such municipality.  In towns, such resolution must be adopted by majority vote of those present and voting, by use of ballot, if at an annual meeting;  and if such resolution is to be acted upon at a special meeting, the procedure for adoption shall be the same as that prescribed for the making of appropriations at special meetings as provided in RSA 31:5.  In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the creation of an authority and of the adoption of a resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority.  Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is need for an authority.  A copy of such resolution duly certified by the clerk shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 203:5 Appointment, Qualifications and Tenure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the governing body of a municipality adopts a resolution as aforesaid, it shall promptly notify the mayor of such adoption.  Upon receiving such notice, the mayor shall appoint 5 persons as commissioners of the authority created for said municipality.  The commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, but thereafter commissioners shall be appointed as aforesaid for a term of office of 5 years except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.  Thereafter, a board of commissioners may request that the mayor appoint a sixth commissioner, who shall be a public housing resident or assisted housing participant within the programs administered by that board of commissioners.  Upon receiving such request, the mayor shall appoint a sixth commissioner.  Any such sixth resident commissioner shall serve for a term of 5 years with all of the powers and responsibilities of that position.  No commissioner of an authority may be a paid officer or employee of the municipality for which the authority is created.  A commissioner shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified.  A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.  A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his or her services, but shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his or her duties.  The powers of each authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof in office from time to time.  Three commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes.  Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number.  The mayor shall designate which of the commissioners appointed shall be the first chairperson, who shall serve in the capacity of chairperson until the expiration of his or her term of office as commissioner.  When the office of the chairperson of the authority thereafter becomes vacant, the authority shall select a chairperson from among its commissioners.  An authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice-chairperson, and it may employ a secretary (who shall be executive director), technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation.  For such legal services as it may require, an authority may call upon the chief law officer of the municipality or may employ its own counsel and legal staff.  An authority may delegate to one or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.

The bonds and other obligations of an authority (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt of the municipality, the state or any political subdivision thereof and neither the municipality, the state or any political subdivision thereof shall be liable thereon, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of said authority.  The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any debt limitation or restriction.  Bonds of an authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt from taxes.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Any municipality may agree to bear any loss incurred as a result of the acquisition of real property which is later not used for redevelopment purposes because a redevelopment plan for a redevelopment project including such real property is not approved by the governing body (or agency designated by it or empowered by law so to act) or is amended to omit such real property or is abandoned for any reason and funds to meet any such loss may be provided as set forth in paragraph XII hereof and as provided in RSA 203:25.

Real property so made available, is declared to be used for essential public and governmental purposes and such real property shall be exempt from all taxes and special assessments of the state or any political subdivision for the period so made available;  provided that, in lieu of such taxes, an authority may require that the owners or operators of any such real property shall make such payments to the state or any political subdivision as the authority finds consistent with the maintenance of the low-rent character of the housing projects or the achievement of the purpose of the housing authorities law.  On or before March 1 of each year, the authority shall furnish to the municipality a certificate setting forth the real property to be exempt from all taxes and special assessments as provided herein during the ensuing tax year.  This paragraph shall apply only to municipalities which have a population of more than 60,000 as of the last published Federal census at the time of the approval of any such exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. Enter into agreements (which may extend over any period, notwithstanding any provision or rule of law to the contrary) with a housing authority for the construction of public parking facilities as provided in RSA 252-A;  provided, however, that any such agreement shall require that the public parking facilities shall be conveyed to the municipality or its designee upon completion of the project.  Any authority may construct such facilities in any area that the municipality shall authorize and shall not be limited to blighted, substandard or slum areas.  Any municipality may issue and sell its general obligation bonds or notes as provided by RSA 252-A to raise funds to be granted to a housing authority for the purposes of carrying out such agreements.  Municipalities may make assessments as provided by RSA 252-A and may increase motor vehicle permit fees as provided by RSA 260:27-b in order to pay the cost of construction of a public parking facility including payment of indebtedness incurred by the issuance of such bonds or notes.
