<center><h3>Section 205-A:2</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 205-A:2 Prohibition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No person who owns or operates a manufactured housing park shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Require any person as a precondition to renting, leasing or otherwise occupying a space for manufactured housing in a manufactured housing park to pay an entrance or other fee in an amount greater than the equivalent of 3 months' rent for said space provided that in no event shall any fee of any kind be charged unless for services actually rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Deny any resident of a manufactured housing park the right to sell at a price of such resident's own choosing said resident's manufactured housing within the park or require the resident or purchaser to remove the manufactured housing from the park on the basis of the sale thereof.  A resident of a manufactured housing park may place no more than 2 "for sale'' signs on or in the manufactured housing for the purpose of selling the home.  The park owner or operator may reserve the right to approve the purchaser of the manufactured housing as a tenant, but such approval may not be unreasonably withheld.  The park owner or operator may require as a condition of said permission that the purchaser and the purchaser's household meet the current rules of the park.  In connection with the sale of a tenant's manufactured housing, the park owner or operator shall not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Make any rule or enter into a contract, which shall abrogate or limit the tenant's right to place "for sale'' signs on or in the tenant's manufactured housing;  provided, however, the park owner or operator may by rule or contract provision impose reasonable limitations as to size, quality, registration of such signs, requirements that the posting of such signs be pursuant to bona fide efforts to sell, and removal when the home is no longer being offered for sale.  No such limitation as to size or quality shall restrict the use of a painted or printed sign which is 216 square inches or less in size and which contains no more than the words "for sale'', along with the name, address and telephone number of the seller, or the name, address, and telephone number of the seller's agent or representative;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Charge a commission or fee with respect to the price realized by the seller unless the park owner or operator has acted as an agent for the manufactured housing owner pursuant to a written contract;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Require the purchaser to provide the names of more than 3 references from whom the park owner or operator can seek information concerning the behavior and financial reliability of the purchaser;  nor shall the purchaser be required to obtain a written report from any such reference;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For a period of 3 years after the implementation of a rule restricting occupancy, refuse to approve the on-site sale of manufactured housing to any person on the basis of age or family status unless such a restriction on occupancy was included in the rules or lease or rental agreement at the time the seller commenced tenancy in the park.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Impose a non-refundable fee for processing an application for tenancy that exceeds $125, unless the park owner provides the applicant with an itemized breakdown of the application fee.  An application fee may exceed $125, provided that it is reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the park rules require a pre-sale inspection of the home, fail to provide written notice to the park tenant, within 14 calendar days of receiving written notification from the tenant that he or she is going to attempt to sell his or her home in place, of all repairs and improvements that the park owner requires in order to approve the sale.  If the park rules do not require a pre-sale inspection of the home and the tenant makes a written request for a specification of the repairs and improvements that the park owner requires for approval of an on-site sale, the park owner shall have 14 days to provide a written list of the required repairs and improvements.  The park owner's response to the tenant is valid for 90 days after which time if a sale has not been completed, the park owner may require additional improvements or repairs of any defective conditions which have arisen since the park owner's initial response.  The park owner may not require:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The repair or removal of anything inside the home that does not adversely affect the infrastructure of the park.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Compliance with an aesthetic standard if the standard relates to physical characteristics, such as size, original construction materials or color;  provided however that nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent a park owner from requiring compliance with aesthetic standards related to maintenance or repairs of deteriorating or defective features of the home, or the removal of a structure or fixture which was added to the home by the seller without the permission of the park owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Fail to provided written notice to the prospective buyer, within 14 calendar days of receipt of the prospective buyer's completed application for tenancy, setting forth the reason for the park owner's refusal to approve or indicating the park owner's approval of the prospective buyer as a park tenant.  If the prospective buyer is denied the park owner shall, upon request of the seller, send a notice of the denial to the seller that does not disclose the reason therefor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Require manufactured housing at the time of sale or otherwise, which is safe, sanitary and in conformance with aesthetic standards, if any, of general applicability contained in the rules, to be removed from the park.  For the purposes hereof, manufactured housing shall be presumed to be safe if it is established that the manufactured housing was constructed to any nationally recognized building or construction code or standard.  Failure to meet any such standard or code, in and of itself, shall raise no presumption that the manufactured housing is unsafe;  nor may such failure be used as a reason for withholding approval of an on-site sale.  The park owner or operator shall have the burden of showing that manufactured housing is unsafe, unsanitary, or fails to meet the aesthetic standards of the park.  No aesthetic standard shall be applied against manufactured housing if such standard relates to physical characteristics, such as size, original construction materials or color.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Require any tenant to purchase any goods or services, including but not limited to fuel oil, paving, snow plowing, dairy products, laundry services, bakery products, or food products, from any particular person or company.  The park owner or operator may require skirting on the manufactured housing and may make rules governing the size and number of out-buildings and additions;  but in such case, must provide the tenant with reasonable options as to the type of materials and construction.  The park owner or operator may also impose reasonable conditions relating to central fuel and gas metering systems in the park;  provided that if such conditions are imposed, the charges for such goods or services shall not exceed the average prevailing price in the locality for similar goods and services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Prevent any person or company from selling to or delivering to or otherwise supplying and servicing any tenant with goods or services, or make any charge or request any fee from any such person or company for such activities;  provided, that a park owner or operator may prohibit or regulate the soliciting or peddling of sales, goods or services within the park premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Require any tenant, or person seeking space in the manufactured housing park, to purchase manufactured housing from any particular person unless the person designated is the park owner or operator and the requirement is imposed only in connection with the initial leasing or renting of a newly-constructed lot or space not previously leased or rented to any other person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Fail to disclose to each prospective tenant, in writing and a reasonable time prior to the entering into of any rental agreement, all terms and conditions of the tenancy, including rental, utility, entrance and service charges.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Make or attempt to enforce any rule which:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Establishes an additional charge or increased rental payments, directly or indirectly, for persons under the age of 18 residing in manufactured housing.  The park owner or operator may make reasonable rules governing the number of adults or total number of persons permitted to reside in manufactured housing and may establish an additional charge not to exceed 10 percent of gross monthly rent per adult per month where the number of adults residing in manufactured housing exceeds the limit established by such rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Requires a tenant to get prior permission of the park owner or operator before an overnight guest can stay in the park;  provided, however, a park owner or operator may require prior permission for any guest who stays longer than 30 days, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Imposes a charge for pets, unless the park owner or operator establishes that services are rendered and expenses are actually incurred because of the existence of such pets;  provided that the park owner or operator may make rules, which at the time of implementation, affect only new tenants and the addition of pets by current park residents, governing the number or type of pets per site and providing for a penalty, after 30 days notice, of not more than $10 per month for each violation of such rules.  Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring a park owner or operator to permit pets, other than those which remain entirely within the manufactured housing and normally require no outside facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Requires a tenant to sell or otherwise dispose of any personal property, fixture, or pet which the tenant had prior permission from the park owner or former park owner to possess or use;  provided, however, that such a rule may be made and enforced if it is necessary to protect the health and safety of other tenants in the park.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Charge or attempt to charge a tenant for repair or maintenance to any underground system, such as oil tanks, or water, electrical or septic systems, for causes not due to the negligence of the tenant or transfer or attempt to transfer to a current tenant responsibility for such repair or maintenance to the tenant by gift or otherwise of all or part of any such underground system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Fail to provide each tenant with the name, address and telephone number of a manager or agent who resides within 10 miles of the park, if the park owner or operator does not reside within 25 miles of the park, which manager or agent shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Be reasonably available in person, by means of telephone, or by telephone recording device checked at least twice daily to receive reports of the need for emergency repairs within the park;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Be authorized to make or contract emergency repairs without specific authorization from the park owner or operator;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Be authorized to make or contract to make necessary non-emergency repairs if the park owner or operator cannot be reached within a reasonable amount of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Fail to provide each person who applies to be a tenant of the park with a written copy of the rules of said manufactured housing park.  Said rules shall set forth the terms and conditions of the tenancy and shall contain the following notice at the top of the first page printed in capital typewritten letters or in 10 point bold face print:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 205-A:4 Permissible Reasons for Eviction. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
After the effective date of this section, a tenancy may be terminated by a park owner or operator pursuant to this chapter only for one or more of the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Nonpayment of rent, utility charges, or reasonable incidental service charges;  provided that no action for possession shall be maintained if prior to the expiration of an eviction notice the tenant shall pay or tender all arrearages due plus $15 as liquidated damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Failure of the tenant to comply with local ordinances or state or federal law or regulations relating to manufactured housing or manufactured housing parks, provided that the tenant is first given written notice of the tenant's failure to comply with said laws or regulations and a reasonable opportunity thereafter to comply with said laws or regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Damage by the tenant to the demised property, reasonable wear and tear excepted.

<center><h3>Section 205-A:4-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 205-A:4-a Notice to Lienholders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who loans money secured by a lien on manufactured housing owned by a tenant in a manufactured housing park may give written notice of such lien to the park owner or operator and shall become an eligible lienholder for purposes of this section by giving such notice.  An eligible lienholder may request the tenant to provide a copy of the park rules then in effect and a written statement disclosing the amount of rent and other charges that the tenant is obligated to pay to the park owner or operator.  If the eligible lienholder is unable to obtain such park rules or information relating to the tenancy from the tenant or is uncertain as to its reliability, such lienholder may request the park owner or operator to provide such park rules or information to confirm its reliability.  The park owner or operator shall provide such park rules and information to the eligible lienholder within 30 days of receipt of such request.  If the park rules are amended or the amount of the rent or other charges are changed after the park owner or operator has received the original notice from the eligible lienholder, the park owner or operator shall give written notice of such change to such lienholder at the same time notice is given to the tenant.  If the eligible lienholder assigns its interest in the lien on the manufactured housing, it shall give written notice of the assignment and the name and address of the assignee to the park owner or operator at the time the assignment is made.  If the loan secured by the lien on the manufactured housing is repaid, the eligible lienholder shall give written notice of the release of the lien to the park operator or owner at the time the release is given.  Any lienholder may release its lien on request of a park owner or operator on such terms and conditions as they may mutually agree.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At any time the tenant is in arrears for more than 30 days in the payment of rent and other charges, the park owner and operator may give written notice of such default by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, to the eligible lienholder with a copy to the tenant.  A specification of the amount that is past due and the current monthly rent and charges shall accompany such notice of default.  The eligible lienholder shall have a period of not more than 60 days from receipt of such notice of default to determine whether it will assume responsibility for the payment of rent and other charges arising after the date of receipt of such notice of the default.  If the tenant pays all unpaid rent and other charges within the 60-day period, the park owner or operator shall give notice of such payment in writing to the eligible lienholder, and no further action by such lienholder shall be required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the eligible lienholder elects to assume responsibility for the payment of rent and other charges commencing on the date of receipt of the notice of default pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, II, it shall notify the park owner or operator in writing, with a copy to the tenant, within the 60-day period and make payment of the rent and other charges that are due;  provided, however, that no late charges shall be assessed against such lienholder if payment is made within the 60-day period.  If the tenant subsequently pays all unpaid rent and other charges, including liquidated damages as provided in RSA 205-A:4, I, due to the park owner or operator, such lienholder shall not be responsible for the payment of rent or other charges thereafter unless a new event of default occurs and it agrees to assume responsibility for such payment pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, II and III.  If the eligible lienholder performs its obligations under this paragraph, it may exercise all of its rights as a secured party including, without limitation, the foreclosure of its lien on the manufactured housing.  The eligible lienholder shall have all of the rights of the tenant to sell the manufactured housing in the park.  The eligible lienholder shall not take any action which is contrary to the park rules provided to it pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, I and shall comply with such rules at such time as it takes possession of the manufactured housing through foreclosure or otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the eligible lienholder elects not to assume responsibility for the payment of rent and other charges pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, III, it shall notify the park owner or operator in writing, with a copy to the tenant, and may remove the manufactured housing from the park within the 60-day period as permitted under the laws of this state.  If the manufactured housing is not removed from the park within the 60-day period, the lien of the park owner or operator provided in RSA 205-A:4-a, VII relating solely to the amount of unpaid rent and other charges due from the tenant arising after the date of receipt of the notice of default by the eligible lienholder pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, II and of reasonable moving costs and storage charges if the park owner or operator removes the manufactured housing from the site shall take priority over the lien of such lienholder.  Subject to such priority lien of the park owner or operator, the eligible lienholder may exercise all of its rights as a secured party including, without limitation, the foreclosure of its lien on the manufactured housing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a lienholder fails to give notice of its lien pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, I, or having given notice of its lien fails to give notice of the assignment thereof pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, I, or fails to give notice of its election to the park owner or operator within the 60-day period pursuant to RSA 205-A:4-a, III or IV, the lien of the park owner or operator provided in RSA 205-A:4-a, VII shall take priority over the lien of such lienholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any park owner or operator who fails to give notice in writing of any change in rent or other charges to an eligible lienholder shall be barred from collecting from such lienholder during the 60-day period provided in RSA 205-A:4-a, II any amount owed by the tenant which exceeds the rent and other charges previously disclosed to such lienholder.  After the expiration of the 60-day period, the park owner or operator may collect from the eligible lienholder the rent and other charges then in effect in the park, as disclosed in the specification required in the notice of default as provided in RSA 205-A:4-a, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A park owner or operator may commence eviction proceedings against a tenant at any time in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and may take possession of the space in the park occupied by such tenant following the issuance of a writ of possession, provided that if there is an eligible lienholder, it must be given written notice of the commencement of such proceedings and the eligible lienholder does not elect to assume responsibility for the payment of the rent and other charges within the 60-day period allowed by RSA 205-A:4-a, II.  The park owner or operator shall have a lien on the manufactured housing of a tenant for the amount of all of the rent and other charges due from the tenant and of reasonable moving costs and storage charges if the park owner or operator removes the manufactured housing from the site, which lien shall take priority over all prior liens other than liens on account of real estate taxes and liens of eligible lienholders except as otherwise provided in RSA 205-A:4-a, IV and V.  Such lien of the park owner or operator shall be in the nature of a security interest in manufactured housing as provided in RSA 477:44, IV.  The park owner or operator may sell the manufactured housing as permitted by RSA 382-A:9 to recover the amount of its claim, subject to the homestead rights of the tenant as provided in RSA 480:1 unless waived by the tenant.  A tenant shall be deemed to have waived the tenant's homestead rights if the tenant has executed a written waiver or if the rent and other charges due from the tenant are more than 60 days in arrears and the tenant has abandoned the premises, as evidenced by the absence of the tenant from the premises and the termination of any utility service serving the premises.  Upon sale of the manufactured housing, the park owner or operator shall convey the manufactured housing by means of a deed or other document conforming to the requirements of RSA 477:44.  The board of selectmen or assessors of the city or town may issue a statement that the manufactured housing may be relocated without the payment of the taxes assessed thereon as provided in RSA 80:2-a in the event the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to pay the full amount of the property tax outstanding.  The costs of sale pursuant to RSA 382-A:9 shall be deducted from the proceeds of the sale and paid to the seller.  Nothing contained in this section shall affect the obligations of the tenant to the park owner or operator under any rental or other agreement or the park rules.

No charges so disclosed may be increased by the park owner or operator without an explanation for the increase and specifying the date of implementation of said increase, which date shall be no less than 60 days after written notice to the tenant.  Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed to permit a park owner or operator to vary the terms of a written or oral rental agreement without the express written consent of the tenant.

II. In the event that a park owner or operator shifts responsibility for payment of water, sewer, or any other utility service to the tenant, the park owner or operator shall be responsible for the cost incurred in the conversion, including the cost of installation of utility meters, if any, on each manufactured home in the park, except as permitted by the public utilities commission pursuant to RSA 374 and RSA 378.  After such a conversion, manufactured housing park tenants shall be billed directly by the utility for the use of such services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any park owner or operator who is billed as a single entity for any utility service shall be prohibited, on and after the effective date of this paragraph, from charging manufactured housing park tenants an administrative fee in relation to such utility service, except as permitted by the public utilities commission pursuant to RSA 374 and RSA 378.

I. No manufactured housing park owner shall make a final unconditional acceptance of any offer for the sale or transfer of a manufactured housing park without first giving 60 days' notice:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To each tenant:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) That the owner intends to sell the manufactured housing park;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Of the price, terms and conditions of an acceptable offer the park owner has received to sell the park or the price, terms and conditions for which the park owner intends to sell the park.  This notice shall include a copy of the signed written offer which sets forth a description of the property to be purchased and the price, terms and conditions of the acceptable offer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To the New Hampshire housing finance authority that the owner intends to sell the manufactured housing park.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. During the notice period required under paragraph I, the manufactured housing park owner shall consider any offer received from the tenants or a tenants' association, if any, and the owner shall negotiate in good faith with the tenants concerning a potential purchase.  If during the notice period, the tenants decide to make an offer to purchase the manufactured housing park, such offer shall be evidenced by a purchase and sale agreement;  however, the tenants shall have a reasonable time beyond the 60-day period, if necessary, to obtain financing for the purchase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The notice required by paragraph I shall be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each tenant at such tenant's abode and to the New Hampshire housing finance authority at its main office.  A receipt from the United States Postal Service that is signed by any adult member of the household to which it was mailed, or a notation on the letter that the letter was refused by any adult member of the tenant household, or that the addressee no longer resides there, or that the letter was returned to the post office unclaimed, shall constitute a conclusive presumption that service was made in any court action in this state.
