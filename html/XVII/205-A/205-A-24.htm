II. Any party acquiring an interest in a manufactured housing park, and any and all title insurance companies and attorneys preparing, furnishing, or examining any evidence of title, shall have the absolute right to rely on the truth and accuracy of all statements appearing in such affidavit, and shall be under no obligation to inquire further as to any matter or fact relating to the park owner's compliance with the provisions of this section.
