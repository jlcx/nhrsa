<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No manufactured housing park owner shall make a final unconditional acceptance of any offer for the sale or transfer of a manufactured housing park without first giving 60 days' notice:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To each tenant:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) That the owner intends to sell the manufactured housing park;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Of the price, terms and conditions of an acceptable offer the park owner has received to sell the park or the price, terms and conditions for which the park owner intends to sell the park.  This notice shall include a copy of the signed written offer which sets forth a description of the property to be purchased and the price, terms and conditions of the acceptable offer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To the New Hampshire housing finance authority that the owner intends to sell the manufactured housing park.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. During the notice period required under paragraph I, the manufactured housing park owner shall consider any offer received from the tenants or a tenants' association, if any, and the owner shall negotiate in good faith with the tenants concerning a potential purchase.  If during the notice period, the tenants decide to make an offer to purchase the manufactured housing park, such offer shall be evidenced by a purchase and sale agreement;  however, the tenants shall have a reasonable time beyond the 60-day period, if necessary, to obtain financing for the purchase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The notice required by paragraph I shall be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each tenant at such tenant's abode and to the New Hampshire housing finance authority at its main office.  A receipt from the United States Postal Service that is signed by any adult member of the household to which it was mailed, or a notation on the letter that the letter was refused by any adult member of the tenant household, or that the addressee no longer resides there, or that the letter was returned to the post office unclaimed, shall constitute a conclusive presumption that service was made in any court action in this state. A receipt from the United States Postal Service that is signed by an employee of the New Hampshire housing finance authority shall constitute a conclusive presumption that service was made on the authority in any court action in this state.
