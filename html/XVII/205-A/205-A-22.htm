&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 205-A:22 Penalty. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The owner of a manufactured housing park who sells or transfers a park and willfully fails to comply with RSA 205-A:21 shall be liable to the tenants in the amount of $10,000 or 10 percent of the total sales price.  The total of damages to all tenants, in the aggregate, shall not exceed $10,000 or 10 percent, whichever is greater, of the total sales price.  This civil penalty shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for violation of RSA 205-A:21 and the failure by a park owner to comply with said section shall not affect the validity of any sale or transfer of title nor shall such noncompliance constitute grounds to set aside a sale or transfer in any court proceedings.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to permit a tenant to attach the real estate for the penalty established by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Lack of knowledge of this section by a park owner shall not be deemed to be a defense to an action for damages based on failure to comply with RSA 205-A:21, I.
