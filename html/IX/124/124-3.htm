Cities, towns, school districts, precincts, and counties, upon the approval of the commissioner of revenue administration, may make application to the governor and council for authority to exceed existing debt limitations for the purpose of taking advantage of such grants or aid as may be offered them by the United States government.  The governor and council may grant to cities, towns, school districts, precincts, and counties authority to exceed existing debt limitations to such extent and in such amounts as they may deem prudent and advisable.  In granting such authority the governor and council may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which such debt limitations may be exceeded.
