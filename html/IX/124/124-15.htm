<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In addition to the positions authorized by law, no new personnel positions, or consultants, or both may be created by the acceptance of federal moneys or moneys from any other source unless such positions, or consultants, or both are approved by the fiscal committee of the general court;  provided, however, that the governor and council may accept all moneys available for any emergency or disaster as defined by the authority awarding such moneys;  and provided further that all such moneys available to the general court or to either of its houses may be accepted by the respective presiding officers with the prior approval of the fiscal committee.  Nothing herein shall be construed to affect the provisions of RSA 98:17-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every board, agency, department or commission receiving such federal or other moneys shall attempt to apply them in whole or in part to the cost of personnel positions authorized by law so as to reduce the obligation of general funds, but if the salaries of such personnel positions cannot be paid out of such moneys then such positions shall be considered as specified in paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All such moneys which fund personnel positions subject to the restrictions of this section shall be used only for the purposes or programs specified in the application for approval of the positions or as otherwise authorized by law, and all such moneys which are accepted in accordance with law are hereby appropriated.
