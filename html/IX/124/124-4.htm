&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 124:4 Application for and Administration of Federal Aid. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the governor and council are hereby authorized to designate from time to time, as they may deem in the best interest of the state, the proper persons or agencies in the state government to take all necessary action to apply for, receive, and administer any federal benefits, facilities, grants-in-aid, or other federal appropriations or services made available to assist state activities, for which the state is, or may become eligible.  All such moneys in excess of $50,000 made available, after designation by the governor and council, may be expended by the proper persons or agencies in the state government only with the prior approval of the joint legislative fiscal committee.  In addition to such other instruments, documents, and agreements as may be executed under the authority of this section, such persons or agencies may execute indemnification agreements, with the approval of governor and council, in the name of the state with and for the benefit of the United States whenever such execution is required as a condition of receipt of such federal assistance.
