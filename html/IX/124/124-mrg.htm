The governor, with the approval of the council, is authorized to apply for financial or any other aid which the United States government has authorized or may authorize to be given to the several states for emergency industrial or unemployment relief, for public works and highway construction, for the creation of employment agencies, or for any other purpose intended to relieve distress.  Any officer of the state who may be designated in any act passed by the congress of the United States, or in any regulation or requirement of any agency of the United States, is authorized in the name of the state to make all applications and sign all documents which may be necessary to obtain such aid, provided that such applications have the approval of the governor and council.  The state treasurer is directed to receive all money so granted by the United States, or by any agency thereof, to the state and to hold all such funds separate from all other funds of the state.  Such funds shall be disbursed by the treasurer upon warrants drawn by the governor for the purposes for which such relief or aid is granted.

All such indirect costs received shall accrue to the state general fund and shall not be available for expenditure by the agency, except that in the case of the departments of transportation and fish and game that proportion of any indirect cost recovery which represents costs of either of said departments as opposed to the state-wide overhead cost portion of the rate shall accrue to the highway fund or the fish and game fund as applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state agency shall include the indirect cost rate for each federal grant in any cost recovery plan filed with the commissioner of administrative services under RSA 21-I:75 and shall notify the department of administrative services of any negotiation with the federal agency relative to the agency's indirect cost rate proposal.  The commissioner of the department of administrative services or the commissioner's designee may participate in such negotiations and shall approve the final agreement relative to the agency's indirect cost rate.
