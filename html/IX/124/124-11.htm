&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each state agency receiving a federal grant or grants shall compute an agency indirect cost rate for each grant as provided by federal regulation and shall apply the same to each grant it receives.  Any state agency making grants of federal funds to any other state agency, either directly or as a pass-through, shall fund the indirect costs for each such grant in the amount of the indirect costs of the state agency to which it has granted the funds in accordance with the indirect cost rate computed as provided by federal regulations by the receiving state agency.  All such indirect costs received shall accrue to the state general fund and shall not be available for expenditure by the agency, except that in the case of the departments of transportation and fish and game that proportion of any indirect cost recovery which represents costs of either of said departments as opposed to the state-wide overhead cost portion of the rate shall accrue to the highway fund or the fish and game fund as applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state agency shall include the indirect cost rate for each federal grant in any cost recovery plan filed with the commissioner of administrative services under RSA 21-I:75 and shall notify the department of administrative services of any negotiation with the federal agency relative to the agency's indirect cost rate proposal.  The commissioner of the department of administrative services or the commissioner's designee may participate in such negotiations and shall approve the final agreement relative to the agency's indirect cost rate.
