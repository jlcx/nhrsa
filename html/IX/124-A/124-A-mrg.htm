<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Actual reasonable expenses in moving himself, his family, business, farm operation, or other personal property;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 124-A:4 Replacement Housing for Homeowners. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In addition to payments otherwise authorized by this chapter, the displacing agency shall make an additional payment, not in excess of $22,500, to any displaced person who is displaced from a dwelling which he actually owned and occupied for not less than 180 days before the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of the property.  Such additional payment shall include the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount, if any, which when added to the acquisition cost of the dwelling acquired by the displacing agency, equals the reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The amount, if any, which will compensate such displaced person for any increased interest costs and other debt service costs which such person is required to pay to finance the purchase of a comparable replacement dwelling.  Such amount shall be paid only if the dwelling acquired by the displacing agency was encumbered by a bona fide mortgage for not less than 180 days immediately prior to the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of such dwelling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Reasonable expenses incurred by such displaced person for evidence of title, recording fees, and other closing costs incident to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, excluding prepaid expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The additional payment authorized by this section shall be made only to a displaced person who purchases and occupies a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling within one year after the date such person receives final payment from the displacing agency for the acquired dwelling or the date the obligation of the displacing agency under RSA 124-A:8 is met, whichever is later, except that the displacing agency may extend such period for good cause.  If such period is extended, the payment under this section shall be based on the costs of relocating the person to a comparable replacement dwelling within one year of the end of such period.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 124-A:5 Replacement Housing for Tenants and Certain Others. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In addition to amounts otherwise authorized by this chapter, a displacing agency shall make a payment to or for any displaced person not eligible to receive a payment under RSA 124-A:4 if such dwelling was actually and lawfully occupied by the displaced person for at least 90 days immediately before:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The initiation of negotiations for the purchase of such dwelling;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such other event as the lead agency shall prescribe, if displacement is not a direct result of the acquisition.  Payment shall consist of the amount, not to exceed $5,250, necessary to enable such person to lease or rent a comparable replacement dwelling for a period not to exceed 42 months.  Payment made under this paragraph may be made in periodic installments, at the discretion of the displacing agency.  Computation of a payment made under this paragraph to a low-income displaced person shall take into account such person's income.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person eligible for a payment under paragraph I of this section may elect to apply such payment to a down payment on the purchase of a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling and other expenses incidental to such purchase.  Any such person, at the discretion of the displacing agency, may be eligible under this paragraph for the maximum payment allowed under paragraph I, provided, however, that where a displaced homeowner has owned and occupied the displacement dwelling for at least 90 days, but not more than 180 days immediately before the initiation of negotiations for the purchase of such dwelling, then such payment shall not exceed the payment such person otherwise would have received under RSA 124-A:4, I, had the person owned and occupied the displacement dwelling 180 days immediately before the initiation of such negotiations.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding RSA 124-A:2, IV(b), in any case in which a displacing agency acquires property for a program or project, any person who occupies such property on a rental basis for a short term or a period subject to termination when the property is needed for the program or project shall be eligible for advisory services to the extent determined by the displacing agency.
