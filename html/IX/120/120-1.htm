Whenever the United States government cannot obtain by purchase any land required by it for public uses, it may, through its officers or agents, file in the office of the secretary of state, and also in the office of the clerk of the town in which the land is located, and cause to be recorded in the registry of deeds for the county, an accurate description thereof with reference to permanent bounds upon the land, accompanied by a correct plan of the same, and petition the selectmen of the town for an assessment of the damages to the owner by reason of the taking thereof.  The selectmen shall thereupon appoint a hearing, give notice thereof, hear the parties, assess the damages, and file their return with the town clerk as required by law in the laying out of highways.
