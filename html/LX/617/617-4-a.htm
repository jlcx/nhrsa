&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In addition to any other remedy provided by law, any person claiming to be an innocent owner of property seized for purposes of forfeiture may petition the court, after 10 days from the date of seizure, for return of the property.  No item or property interest shall be subject to forfeiture unless the alleged innocent owner thereof was a consenting party to the crime.  This section shall not apply to property seized as evidence in a pending criminal investigation or prosecution.
