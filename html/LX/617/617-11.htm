I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, at any time when unclaimed property or contraband held for evidentiary purposes is no longer needed for that purpose, the court may order the state to deliver any unclaimed property, other than currency, to the commissioner of the department of administrative services, to deliver any currency to the state treasurer, and to destroy any contraband within 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the forfeiture is granted, the court may order the state to deliver any currency to the state treasurer and any other property to the commissioner of the department of administrative services within 30 days.  The commissioner of the department of administrative services shall dispose of the forfeited property at public auction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon motion, the court may order that a portion of the currency seized or proceeds from public auction be used to pay reasonable nonpersonnel expenses of the seizure, storage, and maintenance of custody of any forfeited items.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The auction proceeds and forfeited currency shall be forwarded to the state treasurer and shall be used first to pay all outstanding recorded liens on the forfeited property, then to comply with an order of the court to pay reasonable nonpersonnel expenses, with all remaining funds to be deposited into the drug forfeiture fund.
