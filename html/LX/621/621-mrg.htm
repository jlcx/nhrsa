<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The panel shall meet annually during the month of October to review or modify population limits for each residential facility controlled by the center.  Minutes of annual meetings shall be kept for at least 7 years and shall be maintained by the commissioner.  If new facilities are made available or existing facilities are modified, the panel shall convene to fix the population limit before any residential use is made of the new or modified facility.  Population limits shall be supplied to the commissioner in letter form at the conclusion of each meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Population limits fixed by the panel for each facility shall be prominently displayed in the administrative area of the center.

IV. When youth development center facilities used for detention approach maximum population capability as fixed by the panel, the district courts shall be notified by the commissioner or his agent so that the courts may determine alternatives to detention at the center.  Courts shall be notified to consider other facilities when all space in the detention houses is assigned.  Expenses arising from alternative detention shall be borne by the city or town in which the minor resides at the time the petition is filed or, if such place of residence cannot be determined, by the city or town in which the alleged offense occurred.  Either city or town shall have a right of action for these expenses against the person chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities.  A court may make such order as to reimbursement as may be reasonable and just, based on the person's ability to pay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 621:27 Incorrigibles. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a minor committed or detained at the center shall be found by the department to be incorrigible and dangerous to the discipline of the center, the department may order the minor to be transferred and committed to another institution with facilities for minors for a time not exceeding the time when the commitment to the center expires.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall cause an attested copy of its order to be served on the minor and his or her father or mother or guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis, either personally or by certified mail.  No defect or insufficiency in the service of the copy shall invalidate the order of transfer and commitment.  The minor, or any interested person in the minor's behalf, may, within 30 days from the entry of the order, petition the superior court or any justice of the superior court for a review of the findings and order of transfer and commitment to determine whether the order was justified.  The court or justice shall immediately fix a time and place for hearing and make such orders relative to the giving of notice of the hearing as may be proper and, upon hearing all relevant evidence, an order shall be entered as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The minor may be transferred to any institution upon payment by the center of a reasonable sum for the minor's care and maintenance, and for such time, not exceeding the minority, as the department may determine.  The center shall have the right of recovery in accordance with RSA 169-B:40 and RSA 621:31.
