&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 622:49 Notification of Granting of Off-Grounds Privileges by Director. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Not less than 30 days before the intended date of the granting of off-grounds privileges by the director to any person committed to the unit by criminal proceedings and subsequently transferred to the state mental health services system, the director shall give notice of such intention to the commissioner.  The commissioner shall give notice of the director's intention to the superior court for the county in which said person was committed, to the attorney general, and to the county attorney, if any, who prosecuted the case.  The superior court justice, the attorney general, or the county attorney, if any, who prosecuted the case may request a hearing before the superior court, in which case the director shall not grant off-grounds privileges to such person prior to the hearing.  Following such hearing, the court may approve such off-grounds privileges or may order that no off-grounds privileges be granted at the time.  In the event that the order of commitment by the superior court shall expressly provide restrictions upon the manner of commitment, such restrictions shall be observed until such restrictions are modified by further order of the court.
