&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner of corrections may contract for the sale or lease of goods and products which are produced at the state prisons on the open market at competitive prices, when, in his opinion, such sale or lease is in the best interests of the inmates and of the prisons and does not conflict unduly with the availability of prison manufactured goods to state and public institutions as provided for in RSA 622:5, VI and RSA 622:28, and results in the best utilization of the prison production capacity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner of corrections shall not, nor shall any other authority, make any contract by which the labor or time of any prisoner in the state prisons or in any reformatory, penitentiary, or jail in the state shall be farmed out, given or sold to any person.
