<codesect>
If any prisoner shall willfully escape from a state prison or commit a breach of discipline while confined in said prison, or when at liberty on parole shall violate any of the terms and conditions governing prisoners on parole, the commissioner of corrections may, in his or her discretion, cause the forfeiture of all earnings remaining to the prisoner's credit, and the same shall be credited to the account from which it was taken.
