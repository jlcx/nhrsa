As used in this subdivision:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Solar energy'' means radiant energy, whether direct, diffuse, or reflected, received from the sun at wavelengths suitable for conversion into thermal, chemical, or electrical energy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Solar energy collector'' means part or all of a device or structure used to transform solar energy into thermal, chemical, or electrical energy and any space or structural components of a building specifically designed to retain heat derived from solar energy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Solar skyspace'' means the space between a solar energy collector and the sun which must remain unobstructed in order to permit sufficient solar energy to the collector for thermally efficient operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Solar skyspace easement'' means a limitation, whether or not stated in the form of a restrictive easement, covenant, or condition, in any deed or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the landowner described in the deed or instrument creating and preserving a right to unobstructed access to solar energy;  provided, however, the easement shall be exempt from the frontage and area requirements of local zoning ordinances.
