<codesect>
After execution of the mortgage provided for in RSA 477:37, both parties to the mortgage may then execute and attach thereto the affidavit required by law to be attached to mortgages of personal property;  said mortgage, consent and affidavit may then be recorded with the proper town clerk, as mortgages of personal property are required to be recorded;  and thereupon the lien of said mortgage shall be extended to cover said trees after they are cut, and the lumber therefrom, as fully as though the same had been mortgaged as personal property after cutting.
