&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 477:3-b Limitations on Possibilities of Reverter, Rights of Re-entry, and Executory Interests. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section applies only to legal future interests in real property created by deed, will, or power of appointment and not to any beneficial interests created by or through trusts.  This section shall not apply to rights of forfeiture or re-entry held by lessors or mortgagees, nor to conveyances of standing trees governed by RSA 477:35-a or RSA 477:35-b, nor to options to purchase real estate, whatever their form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) After December 31, 2008, no legal possibility of reverter, right of re-entry, or executory interest in real property may be retained or created unless either the grantor or the grantee is a public or charitable organization.  Any language purporting to retain or create such a future interest shall be void.  Language which also creates a covenant may be enforced as such by an action at law or equity but without forfeiture.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of this section, an organization is public or charitable if it is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Renewal declarations shall be required in certain cases.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Unless the original grantor or grantee of the interest was, or the present owner of the interest is, a public or charitable organization, any existing possibility of reverter, right of re-entry, or executory interest in real property shall become void unless renewal declarations are filed in the appropriate registry of deeds as hereinafter provided.  Covenants as such are not subject to renewal and remain enforceable by an action at law or equity but without forfeiture.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Times of filing future interests under this section shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A declaration of renewal of an existing possibility of reverter, right of re-entry, or executory interest in real property that was retained by or granted to a natural person need not be recorded while owned by that person.  Any subsequent heir, devisee, grantee, creditor, or other successor to such interest shall record a declaration within 3 years after acquiring it or the interest shall become void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A declaration of renewal of an existing possibility of reverter, right of re-entry, or executory interest in real property other than those retained by or granted to a natural person shall be filed on or before January 2, 2011, and if such declaration is not filed within such time, the interest shall become void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A declaration shall be recorded once in every 25 years after the initial declaration is filed, and any interest for which such a declaration is not filed shall become void 25 years after the filing of the last renewal declaration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A declaration shall be signed and acknowledged by the declarant in the same manner as a deed and contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A statement that the declarant owns all or part of a future interest reserved or created by a specified instrument and the declarant's current mailing address.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The date of that instrument and the book and page, probate file, or other specific place where the instrument is recorded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The names of the owner or owners of the property rights subject to the future interest as of the time the declaration is filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Each declaration shall be indexed in the grantor index under the name or names of the persons stated therein to be the owners of the property right subject to the future interest at the time of filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The original declaration shall be returned to the declarant after recording in the same manner as a deed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A declaration which is actually recorded and correctly indexed shall be effective despite failure to name all present owners of the property subject to the future interest so long as at least one owner was correctly identified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The fee for filing a declaration shall be the same as for a deed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unclaimed future interests of defunct public or charitable organizations shall be treated in the following manner:  Whenever it shall appear that a public or charitable organization holding a possibility of reverter, right of re-entry, or executory interest has been defunct for more than 3 years with no successor to the future interest provided for or action commenced to determine a successor, the director of charitable trusts shall either commence such an action or, if it appears to be in the public interest, release the future interest to the owners of the underlying estate, with or without conditions.

<center><h3>Section 477:25-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 477:25-a Conveyances To or From Trusts Without Naming Trustees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In any conveyance of real property or any interest in real property in this state, if the grantee or one or more of the grantees is named as a trust, whether the trust is created under the laws of this state or of any other jurisdiction, and no trustee of that trust is named as a grantee in his or her or its capacity as trustee, then the conveyance is deemed to have been made to all of the trustees of the trust who have accepted the office of trustee in their capacity as trustees of the trust, as though they had been named as grantees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a trustee who would be deemed by this paragraph to have accepted title to real property but who has not either expressly accepted title or participated in any transaction involving the property other than as allowed by RSA 564-B:7-701(c) may, to the extent not prohibited by the terms of the trust or otherwise, decline to accept such real property by recording an affidavit reciting such nonacceptance and nonparticipation and lack of prohibition and declining to accept title, in the registry in which the conveyance subject to this paragraph was recorded;  and upon the recording of such an affidavit, such trustee shall be deemed never to have accepted or held title to the real property that is the subject of such conveyance;  but such declination of title by one or more but not all of the trustees shall not prevent the vesting of title to the entire interest conveyed in the remaining trustees.  Notwithstanding this right of trustees to decline title, the title of any bona fide purchaser whose title is derived by instrument recorded subsequent to the date of recording of the conveyance subject to this section shall not be adversely affected by the recording of a trustee's affidavit declining title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In any conveyance of real property or any interest in real property in this state, the conveyance is deemed to have been made by all of the persons who signed the instrument of conveyance in the expressly denoted capacity of trustees of the trust, as though they had been named as such in the granting clause as grantors instead of the trust, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The granting clause designates or includes as grantor a trust, whether the trust is created under the laws of this state or of any other jurisdiction, and the granting clause does not include as grantors one or more persons expressly described as trustees of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The signature block designates the trust as a signatory entity, followed by the signatures of one or more persons expressly described as trustees;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Both subparagraphs (a) and (b) apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who claims title to any real property or any interest in real property in this state by virtue of the failure of an instrument of conveyance delivered before the effective date of this section to name as grantor or as grantee any trustee of a trust may preserve that claim by recording a notice, within 2 years from the effective date of this section, in the registry of deeds where the instrument of conveyance is recorded.  In order for the notice to be effective, it shall contain the name and mailing address of the claimant, the names of the parties to the instrument of conveyance that is claimed to be defective, the names of the current owners of record, the book and page numbers where the instrument of conveyance is recorded, and a statement of the purported defect on which the claim is based.  The notice described in this paragraph may be presented for recording by the claimant or by any other person acting on behalf of a claimant who is under a disability or is unable to assert a claim on the claimant's own behalf, but a disability or lack of knowledge of any kind shall not suspend or extend the period for the recording of the notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This section shall not apply to any trust that, as determined by the laws of its situs, is an entity capable of holding and conveying title in its own name.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to recognize trusts created under the laws of this state as entities capable of holding or conveying title to real property in their own names.  This section applies to conveyances made before, on, or after the effective date of this section, but nothing contained in this section shall be construed to suggest or require that any instrument delivered before the effective date of this section is invalid.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to extend the period for the commencement of an action or for the performance of any other required act under any statute of limitations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Other than as expressly stated, this section shall not be read to mean that a conveyance falling within the terms of paragraph I or II is any more or less valid or has any different effect with regard to the trustees or the trust than if the trustees had been expressly named as such in the granting clause.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 477:49 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
As used in this subdivision:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Solar energy'' means radiant energy, whether direct, diffuse, or reflected, received from the sun at wavelengths suitable for conversion into thermal, chemical, or electrical energy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Solar energy collector'' means part or all of a device or structure used to transform solar energy into thermal, chemical, or electrical energy and any space or structural components of a building specifically designed to retain heat derived from solar energy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Solar skyspace'' means the space between a solar energy collector and the sun which must remain unobstructed in order to permit sufficient solar energy to the collector for thermally efficient operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Solar skyspace easement'' means a limitation, whether or not stated in the form of a restrictive easement, covenant, or condition, in any deed or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the landowner described in the deed or instrument creating and preserving a right to unobstructed access to solar energy;  provided, however, the easement shall be exempt from the frontage and area requirements of local zoning ordinances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 477:50 Creation of a Solar Skyspace Easement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A solar skyspace easement may be acquired and transferred and shall be recorded in the same manner as any other conveyance of an interest in real property.  The easement shall run with the land benefited and burdened and shall terminate upon the conditions stated in the instrument creating the easement or upon court decree based upon abandonment or changed conditions or as provided in RSA 477:26;  provided, however, that no planning board may require a landowner to grant an easement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An instrument creating a solar skyspace easement shall include, but not be limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A description of the vertical and horizontal angles, expressed in degrees and measured from the site of the solar energy system, at which the solar skyspace easement extends over the real property subject to the solar skyspace easement, or any other description which describes the 3-dimensional space, or the place and times of day in which an obstruction to solar energy is prohibited or limited;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Terms or conditions under which the easement is granted or shall be terminated;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provisions for compensation of the benefited landowner in the event of interference with the enjoyment of the easement or compensation of the burdened landowner for maintaining the easement;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A description of the real property subject to the solar skyspace easement and a description of the real property benefiting from the solar skyspace easement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A solar skyspace easement shall not terminate within 10 years after its creation unless an earlier termination is expressly stated in the instrument or is otherwise negotiated by the owners of the benefited and burdened land.  The easement may be enforced by proceedings in equity and by actions at law for damages.
