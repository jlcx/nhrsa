I. Application of Real Estate Laws.  Buildings situated on land not belonging to the owners of the buildings shall be deemed real estate for purposes of transfer, whether voluntary or involuntary, and shall be conveyed, mortgaged or leased, and shall be subjected to attachment, other liens, foreclosure and execution, in the same manner and with the same formality as real estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Manufactured Housing.  Manufactured housing, as defined by RSA 674:31, shall be deemed a building for the purpose of paragraph I when such manufactured housing is placed on a site and tied into required utilities.  Any deed conveying manufactured housing or evidencing its relocation within this state shall be substantially in the form provided in subparagraphs (a) and (b).  If a deed for any manufactured housing is recorded in the registry of deeds of one county of this state and if such manufactured housing is relocated to another site in that county or to a site in another county of this state, a deed evidencing the change of location shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of the county in which it was originally located and a duplicate original shall also be recorded in the registry of deeds of the county to which it was relocated.  If such manufactured housing is relocated to a site outside of this state, a statement evidencing the change of location substantially in the form provided in subparagraph (c) shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of the county in this state in which it was previously located.  An attachment, lien or other encumbrance on manufactured housing, when properly created and recorded as required by law, shall continue to be enforceable until released or discharged notwithstanding the relocation of the manufactured housing within or outside of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A deed in substance following the form provided in this subparagraph shall, when duly executed and delivered, have the force and effect of a deed in fee simple to the grantee, heirs, successors and assigns, to their own use, with covenant on the part of the grantor, for the grantor, the grantor's heirs, executors and administrators that, at the time of the delivery of such deed, the grantor was lawfully seized in fee simple of the manufactured housing;  that such manufactured housing was free from all incumbrances, except as stated;  that the grantor had good right to sell and convey the same to the grantee, the grantee's heirs, successors and assigns;  and that the grantor and the grantor's heirs, executors and administrators shall warrant and defend the same to the grantee and the grantee's heirs, successors and assigns, against the lawful claims and demands of all persons.  No owner of land shall unreasonably withhold the consent required by this statutory form.
