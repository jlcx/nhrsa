<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Within 5 days after receipt of a notice of cancellation given in accordance with this chapter, the pre-foreclosure purchaser shall return, without condition, any original deed, title, contract, and any other document signed by the homeowner.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

As used in this subparagraph, the term "net proceeds from any resale'' means the resale price minus any necessary funds actually expended by the pre-foreclosure purchaser on the homeowner's behalf in order to delay or prevent the mortgage default of delinquency, foreclosure, or execution of a tax deed;
<br>
