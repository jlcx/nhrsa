I. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 479:10, if such mortgagee fails to make such discharge of the mortgage within 60 days from receipt of payment of the mortgage in accordance with the payoff statement furnished to the mortgagor by the mortgagee, an attorney-at-law licensed to practice in the state of New Hampshire may, on behalf of the mortgagor;  the mortgagor's executor, administrator, assignee, transferee, or other successor in title;  or the mortgagee of the mortgagor's transferee or other successor in title;  execute and cause to be recorded in the registry of deeds in which the mortgage is recorded, an affidavit which states that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The affiant is an attorney-at-law in good standing and licensed to practice in the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The affidavit is made on behalf of, and at the request of, the mortgagor;  the mortgagor's executor, administrator, assignee, transferee, or other successor in title;  or the mortgagee of the mortgagor's transferee or other successor in title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The mortgagee has provided a payoff statement with respect to the loan secured by the mortgage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The affiant has ascertained that the mortgagee has received payment of the loan secured by the mortgage in accordance with the payoff statement, as evidenced by a bank check, certified check or attorney's clients' funds account check which has been negotiated by the mortgagee and bears no indication of a stop payment order or return for insufficient funds, or by other equivalent documentary evidence of such receipt of payment by the mortgagee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) More than 60 days have elapsed since such payment was received by the mortgagee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The affiant has given the mortgagee at least 15 days' notice in writing by certified mail, sent to the mortgagee's last known address, of intention to execute and cause to be recorded an affidavit in accordance with this section, together with a copy of the proposed affidavit;  and the mortgagee has not delivered a discharge in response to such notification and the mortgagor has complied with any request made by the mortgagee for additional payment at least 15 days prior to the date of the affidavit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The affidavit shall include the names and addresses of both the mortgagor and the mortgagee, the date of the mortgage, and the title reference.  Similar information shall be included with respect to any recorded assignment of the mortgage.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A photostatic copy of the payoff statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The affidavit, when recorded, shall constitute a discharge of the mortgage and a release of the lien created by the mortgage on the mortgaged premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any person who causes an affidavit to be recorded in accordance with this section, knowing the information and statements contained in the affidavit to be false, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In this section, the term "payoff statement'' means a written statement of the amount of the unpaid balance on the mortgage including principal, interest, and other charges properly assessed pursuant to the loan documentation of such mortgage and a statement of the interest on a per diem basis with respect to the unpaid principal balance on the mortgage.  For the purposes of this section, a regular periodic account statement is not considered a payoff statement unless the mortgagee expressly states thereon that the statement represents a final payoff statement and it also contains a per diem rate or amount for calculating the final mortgage payoff amount.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notice of such sale shall be published once a week for 3 successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation within the town or county in which the property is situated.  In the event that the mortgaged premises are situated in more than one county, publication in a newspaper of statewide circulation shall be sufficient.  The first publication shall be not less than 20 days before the date of sale, calculated by excluding the date of publication of the first notice and the date of sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A copy of said notice shall be served upon the mortgagor or sent by registered or certified mail to his last known address or to such person as may be agreed upon in the mortgage at least 25 days before the sale.  The term "mortgagor'' shall include the mortgagor and any grantee, assignee, devisee or heir of the mortgagor holding a recorded interest in the mortgaged premises subordinate to the lien of the mortgage, provided that such interest is recorded, at least 30 days before the date of the sale, in the registry of deeds for the county in which the mortgaged premises are situated.  Like notice shall be sent to any person having a lien of record on the mortgaged premises, provided that the lien is recorded at least 30 days before the date of the sale in the registry of deeds.  The notice shall be sent not less than 21 days before the sale.  Such notice of sale shall be sufficient if it fully sets forth the date, time, and place of sale;  the town, county, street or highway and street number, if any, of the mortgaged premises;  the date of the mortgage;  the volume and page of the recording of the mortgage;  and the terms of the sale.  Any mortgagor or record lienholder who refuses to accept or claim mailed or served notice or who frustrates attempts by the mortgagee to give notice of the sale by failing to give or leave a forwarding address or by other act or omission shall be deemed to be notified of the sale, provided that such mortgagee shall have made a good faith effort to provide such notice.  Notice of the sale as served on or mailed to the mortgagor shall include the following language:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"You are hereby notified that you have a right to petition the superior court for the county in which the mortgaged premises are situated, with service upon the mortgagee, and upon such bond as the court may require, to enjoin the scheduled foreclosure sale.''  Failure to institute such petition and complete service upon the foreclosing party, or his agent, conducting the sale prior to sale shall thereafter bar any action or right of action of the mortgagor based on the validity of the foreclosure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. No claim challenging the form of notice, manner of giving notice, or the conduct of the foreclosure sale shall be brought by the mortgagor or any record lienholder after one year and one day from the date of the recording of the foreclosure deed for such sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The sale shall be held upon the premises except where a different place of sale is agreed upon in the mortgage.  In the event that the mortgage shall contain more than one parcel of land, the sale may be held on either parcel as may be specified in the notice of sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No foreclosure sale shall be invalid or ineffectual to foreclose a mortgage pursuant to this section if any party entitled to be sent notice and not sent such notice shall, either before or after such foreclosure sale, waive its right to have been sent such notice, or if the lien or interest of such party in the mortgaged premises shall at any time be released or discharged.  A waiver of notice authorized or validated under this section shall be recorded in the registry of deeds in the county where the property is situated.

I. The person selling pursuant to the power shall within 60 days after the sale cause the foreclosure deed, a copy of the notice of the sale, and his affidavit setting forth fully and particularly his acts in the premises to be recorded in the registry of deeds in the county where the property is situated;  and such affidavit or a duly certified copy of the record thereof shall be evidence on the question whether the power of sale was duly executed.  If such recording is prevented by order or stay of any court or law or any provision of the United States Bankruptcy Code, the time for such recording shall be extended until 10 days after the expiration or removal of such order or stay.  If such recording is, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, made more than 60 days after the sale, the reasons therefor shall be set forth fully and particularly in the affidavit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In the event that the purchaser shall not pay the balance of the purchase price according to the terms of the sale, and at the option of the mortgagee, the down payment, if any, shall be forfeited and the foreclosure sale shall be void.
