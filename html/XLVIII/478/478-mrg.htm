For the purposes of this section the definition of the word "subdivision''  shall be that contained in RSA 672:14.

The material composition of the plats shall be suitable for electronic scanning and archiving by the register of deeds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All plats shall have a minimum of  1/2 inch margins on all sides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. All certifications, seals, and approval blocks shall have original dates and signatures in a legible, permanent black ink.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. All plats shall have a north arrow with reference to magnetic grid or astronomic north, as applicable.  The north arrow shall be labeled with its reference direction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Shading over any text shall not be permitted on any plat.  Cross hatching or other hatching at a scale large enough not to interfere with text legibility, before and after reproduction, may be permitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. No lines, whether hatching, boundary lines, or topographic contours shall obstruct or interfere with the legibility, either before or after reproduction, of any bearings, dimensions, or text.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The minimum line widths on plats shall not be smaller than .01 inches.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The provisions of this section shall apply in a county only after they have been approved by a majority vote of both the county commissioners and the county convention.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) There is hereby established in the county treasury a register of deeds equipment account.  If the county commissioners and the county convention vote to adopt the provisions of this section, the register of deeds shall impose a surcharge not to exceed $2, the exact amount of which shall be set by the register, for recording each document for which the register of deeds imposes a fee under RSA 478:17-g.  The surcharge shall be on a per document, and not on a per page basis.  After the surcharge is adopted, it shall take effect on the first day of January following the annual budget acceptance by the county convention.  Each register of deeds shall provide reasonable public notice that a surcharge shall be imposed along with the exact amount of the surcharge, at least 60 days prior to the date on which the surcharge takes effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Once each month, the register of deeds shall pay over to the county treasurer all surcharges paid to the register.  All surcharges received by the county treasurer shall be deposited in the register of deeds equipment account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The register of deeds equipment account shall be a separate, nonlapsing account, and the moneys in the account shall not be available for use as general revenue of the county.  All interest earned on the account shall be credited to the equipment account.  The moneys in the account shall be appropriated only for the use of the office of the register of deeds, and any such appropriation shall require prior approval by a majority vote of both the county commissioners and the county convention.  Moneys in the account may only be used for the purchase, rental, or repair of equipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The register of deeds shall not impose the surcharge, which shall not exceed $2 as provided in paragraph II, whenever the moneys in the equipment account exceed $500,000.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 478:42 Fraudulent Filings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person may not knowingly present for filing or cause to be presented for filing in a registry or other public office, any type of document that fraudulently purports to be a judgment or other document to memorialize or evidence an act, order, directive, or process of creating a lien without having been authorized under state law, the Constitution, or the laws of the United States.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of this section, a document or instrument that purports to create a lien on, assert a claim against, or assert an interest in, real or personal property, is presumed to be fraudulent if it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is not certified or ordered by a court or a judicial entity expressly created or established under the Constitution or the laws of this state or of the United States;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Is not a document or instrument provided for by the Constitution or the laws of this state or the United States.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing contained herein shall affect the validity of a mechanic's or statutory lien created pursuant to state or federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a register of deeds or other public official believes in good faith that a document filed with the registry of deeds or other public office purports to create a lien that is fraudulent, the register or other public official shall index the document only under the signer of the document in the grantor index and shall identify the document as a notice in the document type.  No other names appearing on the document shall be indexed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The register or other public official shall send a copy of such document to the county attorney for the county where the document was filed or to the New Hampshire attorney general's office for review and possible prosecution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The county attorney or attorney general receiving a copy of a document under subparagraph (a) shall send a notice of the action taken under this paragraph to the person presenting or causing such filing by regular mail at his or her last known address no later than the next business day after such action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any such document or instrument on file with the registry of deeds or other public office presumed to be fraudulent or deemed fraudulent as described in this section shall be considered invalid, void, and having no force or effect on any named person or persons named within the document or instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any register of deeds or other public official acting in good faith pursuant to this chapter shall be immune from civil and criminal liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any person who knowingly files a document or instrument to fraudulently create a lien on real or personal property shall be guilty of a class B felony.
