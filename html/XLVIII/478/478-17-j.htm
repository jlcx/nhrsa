&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The provisions of this section shall apply in a county only after they have been approved by a majority vote of both the county commissioners and the county convention.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) There is hereby established in the county treasury a register of deeds equipment account.  If the county commissioners and the county convention vote to adopt the provisions of this section, the register of deeds shall impose a surcharge not to exceed $2, the exact amount of which shall be set by the register, for recording each document for which the register of deeds imposes a fee under RSA 478:17-g.  The surcharge shall be on a per document, and not on a per page basis.  After the surcharge is adopted, it shall take effect on the first day of January following the annual budget acceptance by the county convention.  Each register of deeds shall provide reasonable public notice that a surcharge shall be imposed along with the exact amount of the surcharge, at least 60 days prior to the date on which the surcharge takes effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Once each month, the register of deeds shall pay over to the county treasurer all surcharges paid to the register.  All surcharges received by the county treasurer shall be deposited in the register of deeds equipment account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The register of deeds equipment account shall be a separate, nonlapsing account, and the moneys in the account shall not be available for use as general revenue of the county.  All interest earned on the account shall be credited to the equipment account.  The moneys in the account shall be appropriated only for the use of the office of the register of deeds, and any such appropriation shall require prior approval by a majority vote of both the county commissioners and the county convention.  Moneys in the account may only be used for the purchase, rental, or repair of equipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The register of deeds shall not impose the surcharge, which shall not exceed $2 as provided in paragraph II, whenever the moneys in the equipment account exceed $500,000.
