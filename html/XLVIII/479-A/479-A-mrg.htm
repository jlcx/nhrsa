&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 479-A:5 Common Areas and Facilities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each unit owner shall be entitled to an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities in the percentage expressed in the declaration.

The percentage of the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities shall not be separated from the unit to which it appertains and shall be deemed to be conveyed or encumbered with the unit even though such interest is not expressly mentioned or described in the conveyance or other instrument.  The common areas and facilities shall remain undivided and no unit owner or any other person shall bring any action for partition or division of any part thereof unless the property has been removed from the provisions of this chapter as provided in RSA 479-A:15 or 479-A:25.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 479-A:8 Liens Against Units;  Removal From Lien;  Effect of Part Payment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Subsequent to recording the declaration as provided in this chapter and while the property remains subject to this chapter, no lien shall thereafter arise or be effective against the property.  During such period liens or encumbrances shall arise or be created only against each unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant to such unit in the same manner and under the same conditions in every respect as liens or encumbrances may arise or be created upon or against any other separate parcel of real property subject to individual ownership;  provided that no labor performed or materials furnished with the consent or at the request of a unit owner or his agent or his contractor or subcontractor shall be the basis for the filing of a lien pursuant to the lien law against the unit or any other property of any other unit owner not expressly consenting to or requesting the same, except that such express consent shall be deemed to be given by the owner of any unit in the case of emergency repairs thereto.  Labor performed or materials furnished for the common areas and facilities, if duly authorized by the association of unit owners, the manager or board of directors in accordance with this chapter, the declaration or bylaws, shall be deemed to be performed or furnished with the express consent of each unit owner and shall be the basis for the filing of a lien pursuant to the lien law against each of the units and shall be subject to the provisions of this section.  In the event a lien against 2 or more units becomes effective, the unit owners of the separate units may remove their unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant to such unit from the lien by payment of the fractional or proportional amounts attributable to each of the units affected.  Such individual payment shall be computed by reference to the percentages appearing on the declaration.  Subsequent to any such payment, discharge or other satisfaction, the unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant thereto shall thereafter be free and clear of the lien so paid, satisfied or discharged.  Such partial payment, satisfaction or discharge shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce his rights against any unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant thereto not so paid, satisfied or discharged.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 479-A:22 Priority of Lien. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
All sums assessed by the association of unit owners but unpaid for the share of the common expenses chargeable to any unit shall constitute a lien on such unit prior to all other liens except only (1) tax liens on the unit in favor of any assessing unit and special district and (2) all sums unpaid on a first mortgage of record.  Such lien may be foreclosed by the manager or board of directors, acting on behalf of the unit owners, in like manner as a mortgage of real property.  In any such foreclosure, the unit owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the unit if so provided in the bylaws, and the plaintiff in such foreclosure shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the same.  The manager or board of directors, acting on behalf of the unit owners shall have power, unless prohibited by the declaration, to bid in the unit at a foreclosure sale and to acquire and hold, lease, mortgage and convey the same.  Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid common expenses shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the same.  Where the mortgagee of a first mortgage of record or other purchaser of a unit obtains title to the unit as a result of foreclosure of the first mortgage, such acquirer of title, his successors and assigns shall not be liable for the share of the common expenses or assessments by the association of unit owners chargeable to such unit which became due prior to the acquisition of title to such unit by such acquirer.  Such unpaid share of common expenses or assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses collectible from all of the unit owners including such acquirer, his successors and assigns.
