&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 599:1 Appeals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A person convicted by a district court of a class A misdemeanor, at the time the sentence is declared, may appeal therefrom to obtain a de novo jury trial in the superior court, which shall hear the appeal.  The appeal shall be entered by the defendant at the next return day unless for good cause shown the time is extended by the superior court.  If, after a jury trial in the superior court, the defendant is found guilty, the superior court shall sentence the defendant, and the defendant may appeal questions of law arising therefrom to the supreme court.  In the event the defendant waives the right to jury trial after the case has been appealed, the superior court shall forthwith remand the case to the district court for imposition of the sentence originally imposed by the district court, and the defendant may appeal questions of law arising therefrom to the supreme court.  In all misdemeanor cases which are appealed to superior court or in which defendants are bound over, it shall be the duty of the superior court to transmit to the justice of the district court, within 10 days after the case is finally disposed of, a certificate showing the final disposition of the case.
