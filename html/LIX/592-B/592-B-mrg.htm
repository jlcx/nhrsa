<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

For incarcerated defendants, the state shall provide or make available to defense counsel, or directly to the defendant if he or she is not represented by an attorney, copies of all discovery in its possession, no more than 10 calendar days after the arraignment of the defendant, unless otherwise ordered by the court.  For non-incarcerated defendants, the state shall provide or make available to defense counsel, or directly to the defendant if he or she is not represented by an attorney, copies of all discovery in its possession, no more than 20 calendar days after the arraignment of the defendant, unless otherwise ordered by the court.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a hearing is held, the state shall bear the burden of proving there is probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed and that the person charged has committed it.  At the hearing, the defendant may call witnesses, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence.
