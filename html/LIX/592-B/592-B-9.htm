&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) In any county that has implemented or which will implement the felonies first project established in this chapter within one year of commencing operation of a drug court or alternative drug offender program, the judicial branch shall fund and operate an approved drug court or alternative drug offender program separate from the statewide drug offender grant program established in RSA 490-G, and at no cost to the county.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Before the judicial branch funds and operates a drug court or alternative drug offender program in any county under subparagraph (a), the county shall have first applied for a federal grant for the purpose of establishing a program.  A county shall be required to apply for a federal grant only once.  Any county that applied for a federal grant before the effective date of this section shall not be required to apply again.  In the event the county is awarded a federal grant, or any other grant from a nonprofit organization, designed to fund a drug court or alternative drug offender program, the judicial branch shall fund and operate a drug court or alternative drug offender program only after the federal or other nonprofit grant has expired.  If the county does not receive a federal or other nonprofit grant for which it applied, the drug court or alternative drug offender program shall commence operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The cost of the drug court or alternative drug offender program shall not exceed $490,000 per judicial district in a large county, $300,000 in a medium county, and $200,000 in a small county, based on the number of court filings in each judicial district and subject to annual review by the chief justice of the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A county in which the judicial branch is funding and operating an approved drug court or alternative drug offender program separate from the statewide drug offender grant program established in RSA 490-G:4 shall not be eligible to receive funds under the statewide drug offender grant program.
