&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purposes of this section, an "arrest record'' means a record created by law enforcement personnel to document the arrest of an individual 17 years of age or older.  Arrest records are "governmental records'' as defined in RSA 91-A and subject to disclosure in accordance with that chapter, with the exception noted in RSA 106-B:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Arrest records shall contain, at a minimum:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The identity of the individual arrested;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The identity of the arresting officer or officers unless the officer's supervisor has good cause to believe that identifying the officer would not serve the public interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement as to reasons why and how the arrest was made;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The alleged crime;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whether the arrest was made pursuant to a warrant.
