<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The director of police standards and training may certify a border patrol agent who applies for certification if the agent satisfies the employment and study requirements listed in paragraph I.  Border patrol agents certified under this section shall be exempt from regular physical fitness examinations required of state or municipal law enforcement officers.  A certification under this paragraph shall automatically terminate immediately upon the agent's suspension or termination of employment from the federal agency in which he or she was employed at the time the certification occurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A certified border patrol agent may make an arrest pursuant to New Hampshire law for violation of New Hampshire laws in Coos county if the agent determines that it is necessary to do any of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Protect an individual in the presence of the agent from the imminent infliction of serious bodily injury, as defined in RSA 625:11, VI;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provide immediate assistance to an individual who has suffered or is threatened with serious bodily injury, as defined in RSA 625:11, VI;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Prevent the escape of any individual whom the agent has probable cause to believe has committed a crime in the presence of the agent;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Prevent the escape of any individual whom the agent has probable cause to believe has committed a felony under New Hampshire law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A certified border patrol agent who makes an arrest under this section shall report the arrest, without delay, to the division of state police.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A certified border patrol agent who makes an arrest under the authority of this section shall have the same immunity from liability that a state or municipal law enforcement officer has under the laws of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The state of New Hampshire shall not be responsible for employment benefits, supervision, and defense of the certified border patrol agent, including when exercising authority under this section.  This section is not intended to limit existing authority of federal officers under federal law or to interfere with the performance of federal duties by federal officers.
