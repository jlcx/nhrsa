<codesect>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An inspection warrant shall be issued only upon the request of an official or employee of a state agency, municipality, or other political subdivision and only upon a showing of probable cause supported by affidavit.  The affidavit shall particularly describe the place, dwelling, structure, premises, vehicle or records to be inspected and the purpose for which the inspection is to be made.  In addition, if testing or sampling is requested, the affidavit shall describe the time and manner of such testing or sampling.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Probable cause, as required by paragraph I, shall be deemed to exist if either legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection, testing or sampling are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, vehicle or records, or there is probable cause to believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, vehicle or records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Before issuing an inspection warrant, a justice, associate justice, or special justice may examine the applicant and any other witness under oath, and shall satisfy himself of the existence of grounds for granting such application.

<codesect>
An inspection, testing or sampling pursuant to a warrant issued under this chapter shall not be made between 6:00 p.m. of any day and 8:00 a.m. of the succeeding day, unless specifically authorized by the person issuing such warrant upon a showing that such authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the law, rule, code, ordinance, or regulation being enforced.  An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the person issuing such warrant may expressly authorize a forcible entry when facts are shown sufficient to suggest a probable violation of a state law or rule, or municipal ordinance, code, or regulation, which, if such violation existed, would present an immediate threat to public health or safety, or when facts are shown which establish that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an official or employee of a state agency, municipality, or other political subdivision executing an inspection warrant may be accompanied by suitable assistants, including a sheriff or his deputy, any state police officer, or any constable or police officer of any city or town.
