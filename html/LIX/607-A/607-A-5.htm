I. If the sentence was imposed in this state, the order, certificate, or other instrument of discharge given to a person sentenced for a felony upon his discharge after completion of service of his sentence or after service under probation or parole shall state that the defendant's rights to vote and to hold any future public office, of which he was deprived by this chapter, are thereby restored and that he suffers no other disability by virtue of his conviction and sentence except as otherwise provided by this chapter.  A copy of the order or other instrument of discharge shall be filed with the clerk of the court of conviction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the sentence was imposed in another state or in a federal court and the convicted person has similarly been discharged by the appropriate authorities, the governor of this state, upon application and proof of the discharge in such form as the governor may require, shall issue a certificate stating that the rights enumerated in paragraph I have been restored to the defendant under the laws of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
