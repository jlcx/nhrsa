&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 604-A:2 Appointment of Counsel. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In every criminal case in which the defendant is charged with a felony or a class A misdemeanor and appears without counsel, the court before which he or she appears shall advise the defendant that he or she has a right to be represented by counsel and that counsel will be appointed to represent him or her if he or she is financially unable to obtain counsel.  Unless the defendant waives the appointment of counsel, if the defendant indicates to the court that he or she is financially unable to obtain counsel, the court shall instruct the defendant to complete a financial affidavit in such form as designated by the unit of cost containment.  If after review of the financial affidavit and application of the rules established pursuant to RSA 604-A:10, IV the court is satisfied that the defendant is financially unable to obtain counsel, the court shall appoint counsel to represent him or her;  provided, however, that in any case in which the defendant is charged with a capital offense, the court may appoint 2 counsel to represent him or her.  Whenever defendants have such conflicting interests that they cannot be properly represented by the same counsel, or when other good cause is shown, the court shall appoint separate counsel for each of them.  In a post-conviction proceeding in which a defendant seeks to attack the validity of an underlying conviction, the court shall appoint counsel or approve a request for services other than counsel when the interests of justice or judicial economy require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the court makes an appointment under paragraph I, the appointment shall be made as follows:  first, appointment of the public defender program under RSA 604-B if that office is available;  second, in the event the public defender program is not available, appointment of a contract attorney under RSA 604-A:2-b if such an attorney is available;  and third, in the event that neither the public defender program nor a contract attorney is available, the appointment of any qualified attorney under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event that the defendant disagrees with the commissioner's decision on eligibility, the defendant shall have the right to appeal to the court having jurisdiction over the case within 7 days of notification of the commissioner's findings.  An appeals hearing shall be held before the court in which the defendant will be tried and the burden of persuasion shall be upon the defendant to demonstrate why the determination procedures specified in the rules pursuant to RSA 604-A:10, IV, should not be controlling in the case.  In any such hearing the court shall receive such evidence and argument as justice may require and shall enter an order setting forth its decision within 7 days of the filing of the appeal.  In the event the court alters the commissioner's eligibility decision on appeal, its order shall contain specific findings outlining why the commissioner's decision was not sustained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The court shall review any information available to it regarding the defendant's mental condition and shall require the state to disclose any information as to the defendant's mental condition.  If the court has information indicating the defendant has a mental illness, the court shall act on any application for appointed counsel on the same day as the defendant's first court appearance.  If the application is approved, the court shall, by phone, notify the attorney appointed to represent the defendant and immediately transmit all relevant court documents to the attorney by facsimile or other electronic transmission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The court shall appoint counsel without formal application if the defendant is without counsel and mental illness appears to be interfering with the defendant's ability to communicate, understand court proceedings, or to complete a formal application on a timely basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a public defender is appointed, the public defender, upon receiving notification that the defendant may have a mental illness, shall, on the day notice of the appointment is received, designate a specific attorney to represent the defendant.

<codesect>
Whenever a court appoints counsel pursuant to the provisions of RSA 604-A:2, the court shall conduct an appropriate inquiry as to whether any person who, pursuant to RSA 546-A:2, is liable for the support of the defendant is financially able to pay for such defendant's counsel.  If the court determines that the person liable for support is financially able to pay for said counsel, in whole or in part, the court shall enter an appropriate order requiring said person to reimburse the state for the representation provided;  provided, however, that a child shall not be required to reimburse the state for representation provided to his mother or father, a parent shall not be required to reimburse the state for representation provided to a child 18 years of age or older, and any person who was a victim of the crime with which the defendant has been charged shall not be required to reimburse the state for the representation provided.  For the purposes of this section, the inquiry conducted by the court shall include notice and hearing to the person liable for support.

In any criminal case in which counsel has been appointed to represent a defendant who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expert or other services necessary to an adequate defense in his case, counsel may apply therefor to the court, and, upon finding that such services are necessary and that the defendant is financially unable to obtain them, the court shall authorize counsel to obtain the necessary services on behalf of the defendant.  The court may, in the interests of justice and upon finding that timely procurement of necessary services could not await prior authorization, ratify and approve such services after they have been obtained.  The court shall determine reasonable compensation for the services and direct payment upon the filing of a claim for compensation supported by an affidavit specifying the time expended, the nature of the services rendered, the expenses incurred on behalf of the defendant, and the compensation, if any, received in the same case for the same services from any other source.  The compensation to be paid to any person or association for such services shall not exceed $300 unless the court determines that the nature or quantity of such services reasonably merits greater compensation.  The $300 limit for compensation shall not include or apply to reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred.  In any case in which appointed counsel seeks funds for services other than counsel under this section, the application for such funds may be filed with the court on an ex parte basis and may, upon the request of appointed counsel, be sealed until the conclusion of the representation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any adult defendant who has had counsel or a public defender assigned to the defendant at the expense of the state shall be ordered by the court under paragraph I-b to repay the state through the unit of cost containment, the fees and expenses paid by the state on the defendant's behalf according to a schedule established by the administrator of the cost containment unit with the approval of the administrative justices of the courts on such terms as the court may order consistent with the defendant's present or future ability to pay, such ability to be determined by the unit of cost containment.  The state may collect from the defendant a service charge of up to 10 percent of the total amount of fees and expenses owed by such defendant.  At no time shall the defendant be required to repay, for legal services, an amount greater than the state's flat rate for a contract attorney as established contractually pursuant to RSA 604-B.  If the defendant is placed on probation or sentenced to a period of conditional discharge, the defendant shall repay the state, through the department of corrections, all fees and expenses paid on his behalf on such terms as the court may order consistent with the defendant's present or future ability to pay.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, any juvenile charged with being delinquent who has had counsel or a public defender assigned to him at the expense of the state, or any person liable for the support of the juvenile pursuant to RSA 604-A:2-a, shall be ordered by the court to repay the state through the unit of cost containment, the fees and expenses paid by the state on the defendant's behalf according to a schedule established by the administrator of the cost containment unit with the approval of the administrative justices of the courts on such terms as the court may order consistent with the defendant's present or future ability to pay.  The office of cost containment may collect from the defendant or the person liable for his support a service charge of up to 10 percent of the total amount of fees and expenses owed by such defendant.  At no time shall the defendant be required to repay, for legal services, an amount greater than the state's flat rate for a contract attorney as established contractually pursuant to RSA 604-B.  Liability for repayment under this paragraph shall end when the juvenile reaches the age of majority, except in a case where the juvenile was certified and tried as an adult.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. The court shall enter a separate order, pursuant to the rules adopted by the commissioner of administrative services under RSA 604-A:10, IV, setting forth the terms of repayment of fees and expenses to the state, or if the court finds that the defendant is financially unable to make such payment or payments setting forth the reasons therefor.  A copy of each order shall be forwarded to the commissioner of administrative services.  Any defendant subject to an order under this section may petition the court for relief from the obligation imposed by this section, which may be granted only upon a finding that the defendant is unable to comply with the terms of the court's order or any modification of the order by the court.  If the court does not order full payment for representation under RSA 604-A, the commissioner of administrative services or his designee shall perform an investigation to determine the defendant's present financial condition and his ability to make repayment and may petition the court for a new repayment order at any time within 6 years from the date of the original order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-c. In a case where counsel has been appointed, the defendant shall be required to notify the clerk of the court and the office of cost containment of each change of mail address and actual street address.  Whenever notice to the defendant is required, notice to the last mail address on file shall be deemed notice to and binding on the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All petitions for court appointed counsel shall bear the following words in capital letters:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I UNDERSTAND THAT I MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO ME BY COURT APPOINTED COUNSEL UNLESS THE COURT FINDS THAT I AM OR WILL BE FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO PAY.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If any repayment ordered pursuant to paragraph I becomes overdue, the court having originally appointed counsel may order any employer of a former defendant to deduct from that person's wages or salary the appropriate amount due and to pay such amount to the appropriate department as determined under paragraph I, which shall refund such amount to the state, provided that no money, rights, or credits listed in RSA 512:21 shall be subject to deduction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any defendant whose sentence does not include actual incarceration in the state prison and who has had counsel or a public defender assigned to him at the expense of the state and who, as part of his sentence, is placed on probation or sentenced to a period of conditional discharge shall be required as a condition of such probation or conditional discharge to reimburse the state for all fees and expenses paid on his behalf in accordance with the terms of any order entered pursuant to paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the defendant is incarcerated in the state prison, orders for repayment, pursuant to paragraph I may be suspended until the time of the defendant's release.  The adult parole board may make repayment of any order for repayment a condition of parole or early release.  If the defendant has not been ordered to repay the state for expenses incurred on the defendant's behalf, at any time within 6 years of the time the defendant is released from the state prison the state may petition the superior court for repayment, and upon such petition the superior court shall order repayment unless the court finds the defendant is unable to comply with the terms of any order for repayment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. At any time within 6 years of the disposition of an action in which the court finds at the time of disposition or thereafter that the defendant is not able to make payments to the state as provided in paragraph I, the state may petition the court for an order of repayment.  The court shall order such repayment in whole or in partial payments, unless the court finds the defendant is unable to pay, in whole or in partial payments, the amounts paid on his behalf for fees and expenses pursuant to this chapter.  Notice of each such order shall be forwarded to the commissioner of administrative services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner of administrative services, with the approval of governor and council, is authorized to enter into contracts to secure the repayment of fees and expenses paid by the state as provided for in this section.  Any person or entity with whom the commissioner so contracts may bring any legal or equitable action authorized by law, including any petition authorized by this section, to secure an order for repayment, or repayment pursuant to any order, of fees and expenses paid by the state which are recoverable by the state under this section.  The contract or contracts authorized by this paragraph may include provisions by which the contractor may, as consideration in whole or in part for services, receive a percentage of the amounts recovered on behalf of the state.
