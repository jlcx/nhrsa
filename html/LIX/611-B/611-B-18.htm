I. Except as provided in RSA 227-C:8-a through RSA 227-C:8-g, whenever unidentified human skeletal remains are recovered, the chief medical examiner may store the remains, release them to an educational institution, direct that they be interred in an appropriate resting place, or have them cremated in accordance with RSA 325-A.
