<codesect>
Any person who has been bound over or committed by a justice or district or municipal court under the provisions of RSA 592-A:4 or 6 for trial in the superior court upon a complaint charging a crime not punishable by death, and who desires to waive indictment, may apply in writing to the superior court for prompt arraignment upon such complaint.  Upon the filing of such an application, the county attorney may, with the approval of the court, proceed against the defendant by complaint, and in such case he shall be held to answer and the court shall have as full jurisdiction of the complaint as if an indictment had been found.  The arraignment of the defendant shall be at such time as the court may designate.  Every person when so committed or bound over upon such a complaint shall be notified by the court of his right to apply for waiver of indictment and prompt arraignment as aforesaid.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 601:3 Additional Charges. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the county attorney desires to charge a defendant making application under RSA 601:2 with a crime or crimes not punishable by death other than a crime charged in the complaint upon which the defendant has been committed or bound over, the county attorney may, before consenting to such application, prepare a complaint or complaints charging such other crime or crimes and serve the same upon the defendant in order that he may have an opportunity to waive indictment upon such other charges.  If an application for waiver of indictment as to any such other charge is subsequently filed, the court shall, before approving such application, require an affidavit of service upon the defendant as part of the record of the case.  The superior court shall by rule establish forms for application to waive indictment under this chapter and may by rule make such other regulations of procedure under this chapter as justice may require.
