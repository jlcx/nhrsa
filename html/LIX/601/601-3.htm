&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 601:3 Additional Charges. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the county attorney desires to charge a defendant making application under RSA 601:2 with a crime or crimes not punishable by death other than a crime charged in the complaint upon which the defendant has been committed or bound over, the county attorney may, before consenting to such application, prepare a complaint or complaints charging such other crime or crimes and serve the same upon the defendant in order that he may have an opportunity to waive indictment upon such other charges.  If an application for waiver of indictment as to any such other charge is subsequently filed, the court shall, before approving such application, require an affidavit of service upon the defendant as part of the record of the case.  The superior court shall by rule establish forms for application to waive indictment under this chapter and may by rule make such other regulations of procedure under this chapter as justice may require.
