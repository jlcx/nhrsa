I. Municipalities are encouraged to provide a verified master street address guide (MSAG) and a verified street address guide (SAG) to the bureau of emergency communications for use in developing and maintaining the enhanced 911 data base.  Every year, municipalities are encouraged to provide an updated MSAG and an updated SAG to the bureau.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The bureau shall provide local telephone service providers authorized to do business in the state pursuant to RSA 374:22 with a copy of each MSAG and each SAG for every municipality in the local telephone service provider's service territory.  The local telephone service providers shall match each subscriber in the service territory by telephone number with an SAG address, and shall assure that accurate matches are provided to the enhanced 911 data base.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Municipalities are encouraged to assist the local telephone service providers in identifying the subscriber names associated with SAG addresses, but nothing in this section shall be construed to require municipalities to expend funds to locate telephone subscriber information.
