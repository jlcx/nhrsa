&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 106-H:9 Funding;  Fund Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The enhanced 911 system and the statewide emergency notification system shall be funded through a surcharge to be levied upon each residence and business telephone exchange line, including PBX trunks and Centrex lines, each individual commercial mobile radio service number, each VoIP service number with a place of primary use within New Hampshire, and each semi-public and public coin and public access line.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "place of primary use'' shall have the same meaning as the definition contained in 4 U.S.C. section 124(8).  No such surcharge shall be imposed upon more than 25 business telephone exchange lines, including PBX trunks and Centrex lines, or more than 25 commercial mobile radio service exchange lines or VoIP service lines or channels per customer billing account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of local exchange telephone companies, the surcharge shall be contained within tariffs or rate schedules filed with the public utilities commission and shall be billed on a monthly basis by each local exchange telephone company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the case of an entity which provides commercial mobile radio service the surcharge shall be billed to each customer on a monthly basis and shall not be subject to any state or local tax;  the surcharge shall be collected by the commercial mobile radio service provider, and may be identified on the customer's bill.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the case of a VoIP provider, the surcharge shall be billed to each customer on a monthly basis and shall not be subject to any state or local tax;  the surcharge shall be collected by the VoIP provider, and may be identified on the customer's bill.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Each local exchange telephone company, VoIP service provider, or entity which provides commercial mobile radio service shall remit the surcharge amounts on a monthly basis, as prescribed by the commissioner, to the enhanced 911 services bureau, which shall be forwarded to the state treasurer for deposit in the enhanced 911 system fund.  The state treasurer shall pay expenses incurred in the administration of the enhanced 911 system and the statewide emergency notification system from such fund.  Such fund shall not lapse.  If the expenditure of additional funds over budget estimates is necessary for the proper functioning of the enhanced 911 system or the statewide emergency notification system, the department of safety may request, with prior approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, the transfer of funds from the enhanced 911 system fund to the department of safety for such purposes.  The moneys in the account shall not be used for any purpose other than the development and operation of enhanced 911 services and the statewide emergency notification system, in accordance with the terms of this chapter.  Surcharge amounts shall be reviewed after the budget has been approved or modified, and if appropriate, new tariffs or rate schedules shall be filed with the public utilities commission reflecting the surcharge amount.
