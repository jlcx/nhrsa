&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 106-H:16 Emergency Notification System. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purposes of alerting members of the public about emergencies in a particular area and delivering rapid emergency notification and information, the bureau shall develop and maintain a statewide emergency notification system (ENS).  The bureau shall work with technical members from the wireline, wireless, voice over Internet Protocol, and cable industries to design the ENS for the delivery of emergency messages for emergency state and local government purposes in a manner conducive with existing communications systems and networks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The ENS shall use the E911 database and a database developed for persons who request inclusion in the ENS.  All telephone numbers in the E911 database shall automatically be included in the ENS.  This data shall remain confidential and shall be used solely by the ENS for the purposes of emergency notification and message delivery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The bureau shall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the ENS is fully geographic information system (GIS) capable and able to define an emergency zone by address or geographic area.  Telephone numbers shall be linked to a GIS mapping database and able to perform a query based on address or a general geographic area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The ENS shall include means by which persons can opt-out of the system and also opt-in to the system for communications devices not otherwise included in the system, such as nomadic voice over Internet Protocol phones, internet protocol enabled services, and commercial mobile radio services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. To accommodate the use of the ENS during an emergency, the ENS shall be capable of providing a pre-recorded message and delivering that message to a large number of telephones and communications devices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The bureau shall ensure that every state, county, and local emergency response agency has access to and training in the use of the ENS.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The bureau shall establish policies, standards, and procedures, with the assistance, review, and approval of the enhanced 911 commission and the commissioner of safety, for the ENS.  The bureau shall conduct regular assessments and internal tests of the ENS to ensure that it is functioning properly in compliance with the requirements of this section and that it meets all federal and state requirements for incident management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The bureau, with the approval of the enhanced 911 commission and the commissioner of safety, may develop and modify the ENS to be compatible with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines or requirements for broadcast messaging once adopted.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No cause of action shall lie in any court against any wireless telecommunications carrier, its officers, employees, agents, or other specified persons for providing call location information while acting in good faith and in accordance with the provisions of this section.
