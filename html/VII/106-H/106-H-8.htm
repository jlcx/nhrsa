I. Every telephone utility authorized to do business in the state pursuant to RSA 374:22, I, every entity which provides commercial mobile radio service, as defined in 47 C.F.R. 20.3, and required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide 911 service, and every VoIP provider required by the FCC to provide 911 service shall make available the universal emergency telephone number 911 for use by the public in seeking assistance from fire, police, and other related safety agencies through a single public safety answering point.  Each telephone service provider shall assure that all requests for police, fire, medical, or other emergency services received by the provider or the provider's operator services shall be transferred to the public safety answering point.  Such transfer shall include the calling party's telephone number in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) in a format recommended for data exchange by the National Emergency Number Association (NENA).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of implementing this chapter, any provider of commercial mobile radio service shall be entitled to reimbursement from the bureau of the reasonable expenses incurred prior to the effective date of this paragraph to accomplish the provision of enhanced 911 service to the extent authorized by the Federal Communications Commission and approved by the enhanced 911 commission.  The bureau may utilize the services of any other state agency or a consultant to assist in reviewing the requested reimbursement to insure that it is reasonable and may seek recovery of the expense of that review from the provider.
