I. Any police employee may be suspended, discharged, or demoted by the director for cause, with the approval of the commissioner of safety, but shall be entitled to a public hearing before discharge or demotion, but not suspension, if he or she so requests in writing addressed to the director not later than 10 days after notice of said discharge or demotion.

"Critical incidents'' include injuries to the employee, death of a coworker, mass casualty incidents, or an incident involving the death of a child.
