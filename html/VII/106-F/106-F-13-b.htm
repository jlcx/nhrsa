<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as permitted under RSA 173-B:5-a and RSA 633:3-a, III-d, no licensee or license holder shall engage in activity or stand in the stead or as agent or representative of a person or legal entity that is judicially or statutorily prohibited from making inquiry or having contact, or otherwise legally barred from the activity requested of or performed by the licensee or license holder.  A representation made by the engaging person or legal entity, taken in good faith, that no such prohibition exists shall be an affirmative defense regarding a violation of this section.  A licensee who becomes aware of a prohibition shall immediately desist from further prohibited activity;  shall not provide information gained through the prohibited activity to another person;  and, if such information has been provided, shall have a duty to notify any aggrieved person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No person licensed under this chapter shall be required to reveal other than by judicial order information on the subject, nature, or substance of an investigation or work product to any other person if by doing this he or she would violate the rights and interests of a person engaging the services of the licensee, except to the limited extent that may be needed to dispel the suspicions of a law enforcement officer investigating a report of loitering, prowling, or other suspicious activity pursuant to RSA 644:6, and except to the commissioner of safety or authorized agent when required in an investigation of improper or illegal conduct by the licensee.
