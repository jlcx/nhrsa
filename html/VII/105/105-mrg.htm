I. The authority of any duly authorized police officer, constable or watchman of any town or city shall extend to any other city or town in the state, provided that the chief law enforcement officer of the requesting town or city has executed with the chief law enforcement officer of the responding town or city a written agreement which sets forth the terms and conditions under which such assistance may be requested or rendered.  The executed agreement shall constitute authorization for every request for assistance, and for any assistance rendered in accordance with the terms and conditions of the written agreement, regardless of whether the responding police officer, constable, or watchman is named in the agreement.  In an emergency situation, the ranking on-duty law enforcement official of a town or city is authorized to make an oral request for assistance to the ranking on-duty law enforcement official in the responding town, subject to the terms and conditions of such written agreement, and the authority of the responding police officer, constable, or watchman shall extend to the requesting town.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Where no written agreement exists or no officer is available, any duly authorized police officer, constable, or watchman shall have temporary police authority in another jurisdiction in the state, when requested by a law enforcement officer from such jurisdiction in the state to render assistance to such officer under such officer's direction in an emergency for the purposes of making an arrest or effecting custody of a detainee, conducting a search, quelling a disturbance, providing traffic or crowd control, or securing a crime scene, until relieved by the requesting officer or otherwise directed by the ranking on-duty officer of the requesting jurisdiction.

III. Where no written agreement exists or no officer is available, any duly authorized police officer, constable, or watchman from a nearby town or city may exercise temporary police authority as necessary to respond to a crime in progress, traffic accident, natural or human-caused disaster, disturbance in progress, or other emergency, if requested by a public safety dispatch center authorized to dispatch for the jurisdiction where the event is occurring, because there is no local officer or state trooper available for immediate response and in the judgment of the dispatch center the public safety requires an immediate response.  Such officer's authority shall terminate when relieved by an officer with authority in the jurisdiction receiving the assistance, unless the officer with authority requests assistance pursuant to paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When providing assistance under this section the officer shall remain an employee of his or her respective department.

If the judge rules that probable cause exists, the judge shall order the police department employing the officer to deliver the file to the judge.  The judge shall examine the file in camera and make a determination as to whether it contains evidence relevant to the criminal case.  Only those portions of the file which the judge determines to be relevant in the case shall be released to be used as evidence in accordance with all applicable rules regarding evidence in criminal cases.  The remainder of the file shall be treated as confidential and shall be returned to the police department employing the officer.
