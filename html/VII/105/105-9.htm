&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person desiring to conduct a public dance, circus or carnival shall make application for police attendance at that function.  Any person who conducts a public dance, circus, or carnival without first making application for police attendance at that function is guilty of a violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The chief of police in any city or town, subject to the written approval of the mayor and board of aldermen, board of selectmen, or licensing board shall examine applications for police attendance at public dances, circuses and carnivals and determine if such attendance is necessary.  If the chief of police decides police attendance is necessary, he shall detail one or more police officers to attend whose services shall be paid for by the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The chief of police shall have the authority to assign police details to attend any public meetings or functions which he determines may potentially:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Involve traffic-related problems;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Lead to a public disturbance or public nuisance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Endanger public health, safety or welfare.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. The applicant or sponsor of any public meeting or function may be charged for the services of any police officers that may be detailed or assigned to that meeting or function, unless charges authorized by this section for the services of a police officer are waived by the chief of police when in his judgment such authorization does not conflict with an existing local ordinance or policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The chief of police, the police department, and any city, town, or political subdivision shall not be held liable for any decision not to detail police officers to attend any public meeting or function.
