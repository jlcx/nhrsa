&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 106-J:4 Program Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall establish an alert program for missing vulnerable adults.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a local law enforcement agency receives notice that a vulnerable adult is missing, the agency shall require the vulnerable adult's family or legal guardian to provide information relative to the vulnerable adult's impaired mental condition, intellectual or developmental disability, brain injury, or other physical, mental, or emotional disability.  Once the local law enforcement agency is provided a statement from the vulnerable adult's caregiver that the vulnerable adult is missing and has an impairment, the local law enforcement agency shall notify the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When notified by a local law enforcement agency of a missing vulnerable adult, the department shall issue an immediate alert.  The alert shall be sent to designated media outlets in New Hampshire.  Participating radio stations, television stations, and other media outlets may issue the alert at designated intervals.  The alert shall include all appropriate information from the local law enforcement agency that may assist in the safe recovery of the missing vulnerable adult and a statement instructing anyone with information related to the missing vulnerable adult to contact his or her local law enforcement agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The alert shall be canceled upon notification to the department that the missing vulnerable adult has been found or at the end of the notification period, whichever occurs first.  A local law enforcement agency that locates a missing vulnerable adult who is the subject of an alert shall notify the department as soon as possible that the missing vulnerable adult has been located.
