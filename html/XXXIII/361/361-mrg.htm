&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361:14 Prohibition of Removal or Sale Without Notice. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Prior to the performance of the condition, no buyer shall remove the goods from a recording district in which the contract is recorded, except for temporary uses for a period of not more than 30 consecutive days, unless the buyer not less than 5 days before such removal shall give the seller personally or by registered mail written notice of the place to which the goods are to be removed, the approximate time of such intended removal and the length of time during which he intends to keep such goods in any recording district to which they are to be removed;  nor prior to the performance of the condition shall the buyer sell, mortgage or otherwise dispose of his interest in the goods, unless the seller shall consent thereto in writing.  If any buyer does so remove the goods, or does so sell, mortgage or otherwise dispose of his interest in them without such notice or consent, the seller may retake possession of the goods and deal with them as in case of default in payment of part or all of the purchase price.  The provisions of this section regarding the removal of goods shall not apply, however, to automobiles removed for vacation purposes or to the goods described in section 8.
