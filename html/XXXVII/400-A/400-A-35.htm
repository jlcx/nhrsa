When, by the laws of any other state or country, any taxes, fines, penalties, licenses, fees, deposits, or other obligations or prohibitions, additional to or in excess of those imposed by this state upon companies not organized under the laws of this state and their agents doing business in this state, are imposed upon insurance companies of this state and their agents doing business in such state or country, the same taxes, fines, penalties, licenses, fees, deposits, or other obligations or prohibitions shall be imposed upon all insurance companies of such state or country and their agents doing business in the state, so long as such laws remain in force.
