&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If any individual without reasonable cause fails to appear when summoned as a witness, or refuses to answer a lawful and pertinent question, or refuses to produce documentary evidence when directed to do so by the commissioner or deports himself in a disrespectful or disorderly manner at the inquiry, or obstructs the proceedings by any means, whether or not in the presence of the commissioner or his designee, he is guilty of contempt and may be dealt with as provided in RSA 400-A:21, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner or his designee, as the case may be, may file a complaint in the superior court, setting forth under oath the facts constituting the contempt and requesting an order returnable in not less than 2 nor more than 5 days, directing the alleged contemner to show cause before the court, why he should not be punished for contempt.  Upon the return of such order, the court shall examine the alleged contemner under oath, and the alleged contemner shall have an opportunity to be heard.  If the court determines that the respondent has committed any alleged contempt, the court shall punish the offender as if the contempt had occurred in an action arising in or pending in such court.  Provided however, the contemner shall have a period of 10 days from the determination of the superior court within which to purge himself of contempt and thereby avoid the sanctions imposed.
