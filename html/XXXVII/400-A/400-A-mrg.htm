II. He shall hold a hearing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) if required by any provision of this title,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) or upon written application for a hearing by a person aggrieved by any act or impending act, or by any report, rule, regulation, or order of the commissioner (other than an order for the holding of a hearing, or order on a hearing, or pursuant to such order, of which hearing such person had notice).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any such application must be filed with the commissioner within 30 days after such person knew or reasonably should have known of such act, impending act, failure, report, rule, regulation, or order, unless a different period is provided for by other applicable law, and in which case such other law shall govern.  The application shall briefly state the respects in which the applicant is so aggrieved, together with the ground to be relied upon for the relief to be demanded at the hearing.  The commissioner may require that the application be signed and sworn to by a person competent to be a witness in civil courts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner finds that the application is timely, made in good faith, and that the applicant would be so aggrieved if his grounds are established he shall hold a hearing within 30 days after the filing of the application, or within 30 days after the application has been sworn to, whichever is the later date, unless in either case the hearing is postponed by mutual consent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Failure to hold the hearing upon application therefor of a person entitled thereto as hereinabove provided shall constitute a denial of the relief sought, and shall be the equivalent of a final order of the commissioner on hearing for the purpose of an appeal under RSA 400-A:24.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Pending the hearing and decision thereon, the commissioner may suspend or postpone the effective date of his previous action.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 400-A:19 Conduct of Hearing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may hold a hearing in Concord or any other place of convenience to parties and witnesses, as the commissioner determines.  The commissioner or his designee shall preside at the hearing, and shall expedite the hearing and all procedures involved therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any party to the hearing shall have the right to appear in person and by counsel, to be present during the giving of all evidence, to have a reasonable opportunity to inspect all documentary and other evidence and to examine and cross-examine witnesses, to present evidence in support of his interest and to have subpoenas issued by the commissioner to compel attendance of witnesses and production of evidence in his behalf.  Testimony may be taken orally or by deposition, and any party shall have such right of introducing evidence by interrogatories or deposition as may obtain in the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon good cause shown, the commissioner shall permit to become a party to the hearing by intervention, if timely, such persons, not original parties thereto, whose interests are affected by the commissioner's order made upon the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Formal rules of pleading or of evidence need not be observed at any hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The hearing shall be public, unless the commissioner or hearing officer determines that a private hearing would be in the public interest, in which case and only with the consent of all parties to the hearing, the hearing shall be private.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner or his hearing officer may cause a complete record to be made of the hearing proceedings by a competent reporter or by electronic recording, and if transcribed, such record shall be made a part of the commissioner's record of hearing.  In the event of an appeal from any order of the commissioner issued pursuant to Title XXXVII, if a record of the proceedings is available a transcript shall be made, and expenses of transcription shall be paid by the party making the appeal at the rate charged for transcripts of proceedings in the superior court at the time the appeal is made.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit any party to a hearing held pursuant to Title XXXVII from receiving at any time, upon request and upon payment of expenses, a transcript of the hearing, if a record was made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The validity of any hearing held in accordance with the notice thereof, or waiver of notice, shall not be affected by the failure of any person to attend or remain in attendance.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As to the subject of any examination, investigation or hearing being conducted by him, the commissioner may subpoena witnesses and administer oaths or affirmations and examine any individual under oath, or take depositions;  and by subpoena duces tecum may require the production of documentary and other evidence.  Any delegation by the commissioner of power of subpoena shall be in writing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every person subpoenaed to appear at any such hearing, examination, or investigation shall obey the subpoena, testify truthfully, conduct himself with decorum, and in no way obstruct the proceeding or purpose thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Witnesses shall be entitled to the same fees and allowances as witnesses in the superior court;  except that no insurer, agent, broker, or other person subject to this title who is a subject of such proceeding, and no officer, director, or employee of any of the foregoing, shall be entitled to witness or mileage fees.  No person shall be excused from attending and testifying in obedience to a subpoena on the ground that the proper witness fee was not tendered or paid, unless the witness shall have demanded such payment as a condition precedent to attending the hearing, examination, or investigation and unless such demand shall not have been complied with.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any individual knowingly testifying falsely under oath or making a false affirmation, as to any matter material to any such examination, investigation or hearing, shall upon conviction thereof be guilty of perjury.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If any individual without reasonable cause fails to appear when summoned as a witness, or refuses to answer a lawful and pertinent question, or refuses to produce documentary evidence when directed to do so by the commissioner or deports himself in a disrespectful or disorderly manner at the inquiry, or obstructs the proceedings by any means, whether or not in the presence of the commissioner or his designee, he is guilty of contempt and may be dealt with as provided in RSA 400-A:21, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner or his designee, as the case may be, may file a complaint in the superior court, setting forth under oath the facts constituting the contempt and requesting an order returnable in not less than 2 nor more than 5 days, directing the alleged contemner to show cause before the court, why he should not be punished for contempt.  Upon the return of such order, the court shall examine the alleged contemner under oath, and the alleged contemner shall have an opportunity to be heard.  If the court determines that the respondent has committed any alleged contempt, the court shall punish the offender as if the contempt had occurred in an action arising in or pending in such court.  Provided however, the contemner shall have a period of 10 days from the determination of the superior court within which to purge himself of contempt and thereby avoid the sanctions imposed.

I. If any individual asks to be excused from attending or testifying or from producing any books, papers, records, contracts, correspondence, or other documents in connection with any examination, hearing, or investigation being conducted by the commissioner on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture, and shall by the insurance commissioner be directed to give such testimony or produce such evidence, he must nonetheless comply with such direction, but he shall not thereafter be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he may have so testified or produced evidence, and no testimony so given or evidence produced shall be received against him upon any criminal action, investigation, or proceeding;  except, however, that no such individual so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by him in such testimony, and the testimony or evidence so given or produced shall be admissible against him upon any criminal action, investigation, or proceeding concerning perjury;  provided further that no witness shall be compelled to testify where such testimony would create a reasonable possibility of penalty or sanction by a court, agency, or other body of competent jurisdiction, which penalty or sanction has not as of the hearing date (or the date of any appeal therefrom) been banned by operation of law or waived as to the witness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any such individual may execute, acknowledge and file in the office of the commissioner a statement expressly waiving such immunity or privilege in respect to any transaction, matter or thing specified in such statement, and thereupon the testimony of such individual or such evidence in relation to such transaction, matter or thing may be received or produced before any judge or justice, court, tribunal, grand jury, or otherwise, and if so received or produced, such individual shall not be entitled to any immunity or privileges on account of any testimony he may so give or evidence so produced.

(a) For the calendar year ending December 31, 2006, on or before March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15, every authorized insurer required to pay a tax in accordance with RSA 400-A:32, I shall pay to the insurance commissioner an amount equal to  1/4 of the previous calendar year's tax paid pursuant to said paragraph;  provided, however, any authorized insurer having an estimated liability of $100 or less for each quarter shall make payment in full on March 15.  These payments shall be considered as a partial payment of the tax upon the business done in the state during the calendar year in which the payment was received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the calendar year ending December 31, 2007, and for every year thereafter, on or before March 15 of each year every authorized insurer required to pay a tax in accordance with RSA 400-A:32, I shall make payment in full to the insurance commissioner of an amount equal to 100 percent of the previous calendar year's taxes paid pursuant to said paragraph.  The payments shall be considered as a partial payment of the tax upon the business done in the state during the calendar year in which the payment was received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The taxes imposed in paragraphs I and II of this section shall be promptly forwarded by the commissioner to the state treasurer for deposit to the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any insurer failing to file the report required by RSA 400-A:31 or failing to remit the proper tax within the time for filing shall pay a penalty equal to 10 percent on the amount of the tax due.  If the tax or the estimated tax is not paid when due, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the insurer's certificate of authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the insurer liable for the taxes imposed in paragraphs I and II of this section is a member of a unitary business within the meaning of RSA 77-A:1, XIV, then the entire amount of the taxes due under this chapter by the individual member of such unitary business shall be allowed as a credit pursuant to RSA 77-A:5, III, against such individual member's portion of the total tax liability of the unitary business under RSA 77-A.  In the event that the individual member's credit exceeds such member's portion of the total tax liability of the unitary business, the excess of such credit shall be allowed as a credit against any other individual member's tax liability under RSA 77-A, provided such other member is also subject to the tax imposed by this chapter.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall adopt rules, in accordance with RSA 541-A, to determine an individual member's portion of the total tax liability based upon each member's activity within New Hampshire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 400-A:37 Examinations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Authority, Scope, and Scheduling of Examinations.  The commissioner or any of his or her examiners may conduct an examination of any company as often as the commissioner deems appropriate.  In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of the examinations, the commissioner shall consider the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent Certified Public Accountants and other criteria as set forth in the Financial Condition Examiners' Handbook or the Market Regulation Handbook in effect and adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  Except as otherwise expressly provided, the commissioner shall examine each domestic insurer at least once every 5 years, and he or she shall annually examine, value, or cause to be valued the reserve liabilities, including loss adjustment expense reserves, of each domestic insurer.  For the purpose of making the annual valuation of the reserve liabilities for all outstanding life insurance policies and annuity and pure endowment contracts of domestic insurance companies, the commissioner may employ a competent actuary who shall make such valuation of a company's contractual obligations and the company's compliance with the law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of completing an examination of any company under this title, the commissioner may examine or investigate any person, or the business of any person, in so far as such examination or investigation is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the examination of the company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In lieu of an examination of any foreign or alien insurer licensed in this state, the commissioner may accept an examination report on the company as prepared by the insurance department for the company's state of domicile or port-of-entry state until January 1, 1994.  Thereafter, such reports may only be accepted if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The insurance department was at the time of the examination accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The examination is performed under the supervision of an accredited insurance department or with the participation of one or more examiners who are employed by such an accredited state insurance department and who, after a review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Examination of Non-Insurance Company Licenses.  For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with law or relationships and transactions between any person and any insurer or proposed insurer, and in circumstances where the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe there is noncompliance with or violation of law, regulation, or order, he or she may, as often and to the extent he or she deems advisable, examine the accounts, records, documents, and transactions pertaining to or affecting the insurance affairs or proposed insurance affairs and transactions of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any insurance producer, adjuster, insurer representative, or any person holding himself or herself out as any of the foregoing.  (Provided, however, that if upon examination of any person specified in this paragraph the commissioner shall determine that such person is not in violation of the provisions of Title XXXVII or applicable regulations, the expense of the examination shall be borne by the insurance department.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any person having a contract under which he enjoys by terms or in fact the exclusive or dominant right to manage or control the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person in this state engaged in, or proposing to be engaged in this state in, or holding himself out in this state as so engaging or proposing, or in this state assisting in, the promotion, formation, or financing of an insurer or insurance holding corporation, or corporation or other group to finance an insurer or the production of its business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any rating bureau or organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any licensee or other person subject to this title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Or if adequate information cannot be obtained, any insurance holding company;  or person holding the shares of voting stock or policyholder proxies of an insurer as voting trustee or otherwise, for the purpose of controlling the management thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Conduct of Examinations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination.  In conducting the examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the Financial Condition Examiners' Handbook or the Market Regulation Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  The commissioner may also employ such other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) Every company or person from whom information is sought, its officers, directors and agents must provide to the examiners timely, convenient and free access at all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents and any or all computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business and affairs of the company being examined.  The officers, directors, employees and agents of the company or person must facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so.  The refusal of any company, by its officers, directors, employees or agents, to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the examiners shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the company to engage in an insurance or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. Any such proceedings for suspension, revocation, or refusal of a license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to RSA 400-A:15, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Neither the commissioner nor any examiner shall remove any record, account, document, file, or other property of the person being examined from the office or place of such person except with the written consent of such person in advance of such removal or pursuant to an order of court duly obtained.  This subparagraph shall not be deemed to affect the making and removal of copies or abstracts of any such record, account, document, or file.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner or any of his examiners shall have the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths and to examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination.  Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.  Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When making an examination under this title, the commissioner may retain, without appropriation under RSA 9 and without qualifying as a department expenditure under RSA 4:15, attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the cost of which shall be borne by the company which is the subject of the examination.  The company shall pay the retained professional or specialist directly for these costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state.  Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or company workpapers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the commissioner may, in his discretion, deem appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) For the purposes of this section "person'' means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization, and any similar entity or any combination of such entities acting in concert.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Exam Report, Distribution, Procedure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No later than 60 days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the department a verified written report of examination under oath.  Upon receipt of the verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the company examined, together with a notice which shall afford the company examined not more than 30 days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report.

A copy of the report shall also be furnished by the secretary of the insurer, if incorporated, or by the attorney-in-fact if a reciprocal insurer, to each member of the insurer's board of directors or board of governors, if a reciprocal insurer.  The certificate of the secretary or attorney-in-fact that a copy of the examination report has been furnished to such persons shall constitute knowledge of the contents of the report by each such member.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 400-A:39 Administration Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established in the state treasury an administration fund for the sole purpose of paying all costs of the office of the commissioner.  The fund shall be administered by the commissioner.  The state treasurer shall be the custodian of the fund and all moneys and securities in the fund shall be held in trust by the state treasurer and shall not constitute money or property of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, "affiliate'' shall be as defined in RSA 401-B:1, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state treasurer is authorized to disburse moneys from the fund upon written order of both the insurance commissioner and commissioner of administrative services in accordance with a budget approved by the general court.  The state treasurer shall be required to give bond in an amount to be fixed and with securities approved by the insurance commissioner conditioned upon the faithful performance of his or her duty as custodian of the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Each insurer licensed to do business in this state, including nonprofit health services corporations organized pursuant to RSA 420-A, health maintenance organizations organized pursuant to RSA 420-B, Delta Dental Plan of New Hampshire regulated pursuant to RSA 420-F, and multiple-employer welfare arrangements licensed pursuant to RSA 415-E, shall make payments to the fund each year of its pro rata share of the fiscal year's costs of the office of the commissioner to be appropriated out of the fund.  Such share is to be computed in accordance with paragraphs V and VI of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For each year, the total amount of such payments made to the fund by all such insurers shall be an amount that, when combined with any available fund balance, is not less than the amount appropriated by the general court for the expenses of the office of the commissioner for the fiscal year commencing on the July 1 in which the payments are due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The amount payable each year by each such insurer shall be computed by the commissioner as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Based on the annual statement filed in such year by each insurer under RSA 400-A:31, RSA 420-A:20, RSA 420-B:9, RSA 420-F:9, or other financial statement filed under RSA 415-E:11, the commissioner shall ascertain each insurer's amount of gross direct premiums written, including policy, membership and other fees, service charges, policy dividends applied in payment for insurance, and all other considerations for insurance originating from policies covering property, subjects, or risks located, resident or to be performed in New Hampshire after deducting return premiums and dividends actually returned or credited to policyholders.  If any such insurer does not otherwise timely provide the commissioner with the information necessary for such ascertainment, it shall do so on or before May 1 of each year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner shall total the amounts ascertained for all such insurers under subparagraph (a) so that the commissioner has a total for each nonaffiliated individual insurer and for each group of affiliated insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the total, determined in subparagraph (b), for any nonaffiliated individual insurer or for any group of affiliated insurers exceeds the maximum allowable assessable premium amount, the commissioner shall effect an adjustment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The maximum allowable assessable premium amount shall be $200,000,000 for assessments based on premiums reported in the calendar 2000 annual statements or other financial statement submitted in compliance with RSA 415-E:11.  The maximum allowable assessable premium amount shall increase each year based on the change in the Consumer Price Index, all items, as published by the United States Department of Labor Statistics or any successor or substitute index generally used to determine the purchasing power of the United States dollar and adopted by the commissioner through regulation.  For calendar years after 2000, the ratio of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the index for the period 2 years prior to the calendar year in question to
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) the index for 1998 shall be multiplied by $200,000,000 and rounded to the nearest million to obtain the maximum allowable assessable premium amount.
<table width="640">
<tr>
<td>
<table width="600" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right">
<tr>

The commissioner shall never implement an adjustment to the maximum allowable assessable premium amount that would cause it to decrease from the prior year.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commissioner shall adjust each insurer's assessable premium from that calculated in subparagraph (a) by multiplying the amount ascertained in subparagraph (a) by the ratio of the maximum allowable assessable premium amount ascertained in subparagraph (c)(1) to the greater of the premium amount ascertained in subparagraph (b), or the maximum allowable assessable premium amount ascertained in subparagraph (c)(1).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commissioner shall total the adjusted amounts ascertained for all such insurers under subparagraph (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) For each such insurer, the commissioner shall determine the percent that the amount ascertained for it under subparagraph (c) is of the total amount ascertained for all such insurers under subparagraph (d).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) For each such insurer, the commissioner shall multiply the percent ascertained for it under subparagraph (e) by the amount indicated by paragraph V.  The amount resulting shall be the administrative fee for such insurer, provided that the minimum administrative fee payable by any such insurer shall be $100.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. At the close of each fiscal year, the commissioner shall review the department's actual expenditures against funds collected to determine what part of the fund balance can be treated as an offset to the commissioner's assessment for the subsequent year.  To the extent that it is reasonably practicable, the commissioner shall apportion available offsets to insurers based on the insurers' relative contributions to the fund overage.  The commissioner shall not be required to return previously collected assessments.  Offsets shall only be used to reduce future assessment liabilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner shall perform the calculations required by this section and notify each insurer of the insurer's assessment payable under this section as soon as practicable after July 1 of each year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The commissioner shall be charged with the conservation of the assets of the fund.  In furtherance of this purpose, the attorney general shall appoint a member of his or her staff to represent the fund in all proceedings brought to enforce payment of assessments as provided in paragraph VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. This section shall not apply to fraternal benefit societies or town mutual insurance companies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Any insurer that does not pay amounts due under this section within 45 days of the billing date shall incur a late payment penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount assessed.  In addition, the sum total of the assessment and penalty shall accrue with interest, from the 45th day until the date of payment, at a rate of 0.050 percent per day compounded daily.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The commissioner shall restrict the authority of any insurer, who does not pay amounts due under this section within 90 days of the billing date, to servicing existing in-force business only.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. For any insurer, who does not pay amounts due under this section within 180 days of the billing date, the commissioner may suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. The commissioner may adopt rules that provide for the administration of this section in accordance with state agency accounting principles and practices.
