IV. Any insurer failing to file the report required by RSA 400-A:31 or failing to remit the proper tax within the time for filing shall pay a penalty equal to 10 percent on the amount of the tax due.  If the tax or the estimated tax is not paid when due, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the insurer's certificate of authority.

V. If the insurer liable for the taxes imposed in paragraphs I and II of this section is a member of a unitary business within the meaning of RSA 77-A:1, XIV, then the entire amount of the taxes due under this chapter by the individual member of such unitary business shall be allowed as a credit pursuant to RSA 77-A:5, III, against such individual member's portion of the total tax liability of the unitary business under RSA 77-A.  In the event that the individual member's credit exceeds such member's portion of the total tax liability of the unitary business, the excess of such credit shall be allowed as a credit against any other individual member's tax liability under RSA 77-A, provided such other member is also subject to the tax imposed by this chapter.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall adopt rules, in accordance with RSA 541-A, to determine an individual member's portion of the total tax liability based upon each member's activity within New Hampshire.
