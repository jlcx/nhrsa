Thereafter, such reports may only be accepted if:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) The insurance department was at the time of the examination accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) The examination is performed under the supervision of an accredited insurance department or with the participation of one or more examiners who are employed by such an accredited state insurance department and who, after a review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Examination of Non-Insurance Company Licenses.  For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with law or relationships and transactions between any person and any insurer or proposed insurer, and in circumstances where the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe there is noncompliance with or violation of law, regulation, or order, he or she may, as often and to the extent he or she deems advisable, examine the accounts, records, documents, and transactions pertaining to or affecting the insurance affairs or proposed insurance affairs and transactions of:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Any insurance producer, adjuster, insurer representative, or any person holding himself or herself out as any of the foregoing.

The company shall pay the retained professional or specialist directly for these costs.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state.  Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(f) Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or company workpapers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the commissioner may, in his discretion, deem appropriate.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(g) For the purposes of this section person'' means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization, and any similar entity or any combination of such entities acting in concert.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV.

(c)(1) Upon the adoption of the examination report, the commissioner shall continue to hold the content of the examination report as private and confidential information for a period of 20 days, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If requested by the person examined within 20 days after receipt of the order adopting the examination report, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner, the commissioner shall hold a closed meeting relative to the report.  The closed meeting shall be conducted within 20 days after a request for closed meeting.  Any order of the commissioner issued pursuant to RSA 400-A:37, IV(b)(1) shall be suspended pending a final decision of the commissioner after the closed meeting and the commissioner shall not file the report until after such closed meeting and his or her final order on the report;  except that the commissioner may furnish a copy of the examination report:

(3) After the closed meeting, the commissioner shall issue a final order on the report and shall file the final report.  The commissioner may order the company to take any action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure any violation.  Twenty days after the report is filed as a final report, the commissioner may open the report for public inspection if no court of competent jurisdiction has stayed its publication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If no request for a closed meeting is filed, the commissioner shall issue a final order on the report, shall file the final report, and may take all other appropriate action as set forth in subparagraph (3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A final report shall be filed, and any order shall be issued within 6 months after the adoption of the examination report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) If the report is an examination of a domestic insurer, a copy of the report, or a summary approved by the commissioner, when filed in the department, together with the recommendations or statements of the commissioner or his or her examiner, shall be presented by the insurer's chief executive officer to the insurer's board of directors or similar governing body at a meeting which shall be held within 90 days following receipt of the report in final form by the insurer.  A copy of the report shall also be furnished by the secretary of the insurer, if incorporated, or by the attorney-in-fact if a reciprocal insurer, to each member of the insurer's board of directors or board of governors, if a reciprocal insurer.  The certificate of the secretary or attorney-in-fact that a copy of the examination report has been furnished to such persons shall constitute knowledge of the contents of the report by each such member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In any such action or proceeding, the commissioner or the commissioner's examiners may, however, at any time testify and offer proper evidence as to information secured or matters discovered during the course of an examination, whether or not a final written report of the examination has been made, furnished, or filed in the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Nothing contained in this title shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter relating thereto, to the insurance department of this or any other state or country, or to law enforcement officials of this or any other state agency of the federal government at any time, so long as such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In the event the commissioner determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of any examination, he or she may initiate any proceedings or actions as provided by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
