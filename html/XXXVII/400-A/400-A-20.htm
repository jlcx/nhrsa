As to the subject of any examination, investigation or hearing being conducted by him, the commissioner may subpoena witnesses and administer oaths or affirmations and examine any individual under oath, or take depositions;  and by subpoena duces tecum may require the production of documentary and other evidence.  Any delegation by the commissioner of power of subpoena shall be in writing.

No person shall be excused from attending and testifying in obedience to a subpoena on the ground that the proper witness fee was not tendered or paid, unless the witness shall have demanded such payment as a condition precedent to attending the hearing, examination, or investigation and unless such demand shall not have been complied with.
