&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-F:2 RBC Reports. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every domestic insurer shall, on or prior to each March 1 (the "filing date''), prepare and submit to the commissioner a report of its RBC levels as of the end of the calendar year just ended, in a form and containing such information as is required by the RBC instructions.  In addition, every domestic insurer shall file its RBC report:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) With the NAIC in accordance with the RBC instructions;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) With the insurance commissioner in any state in which the insurer is authorized to do business, if the insurance commissioner has notified the insurer of its request in writing, in which case the insurer shall file its RBC report not later than the later of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Fifteen days from the receipt of notice to file its RBC report with that state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The filing date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A life and/or health insurer's RBC shall be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the RBC instructions.  The formula shall take into account, and may adjust for the covariance between:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The risk with respect to the insurer's assets;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The risk of adverse insurance experience with respect to the insurer's liabilities and obligations;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The interest rate risk with respect to the insurer's business;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) All other business risks and such other relevant risks as are set forth in the RBC instructions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A property and casualty insurer's RBC shall be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the RBC instructions.  The formula shall take into account, and may adjust for the covariance between:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Asset risk;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Credit risk;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Underwriting risk;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
determined in each case by applying the factors in the manner set forth in the RBC instructions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An excess of capital over the amount produced by the risk-based capital requirement contained in this chapter and the formulas, schedules, and instructions referenced in this chapter is desirable in the business of insurance.  Accordingly, insurers should seek to maintain capital above the RBC levels required by this chapter.  Additional capital is used and useful in the insurance business and helps to secure an insurer against various risks inherent in, or affecting, the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a domestic insurer files an RBC report which in the judgment of the commissioner is inaccurate, then the commissioner shall adjust the RBC report to correct the inaccuracy and shall notify the insurer of the adjustment.  The notice shall contain a statement of the reason for the adjustment.  An RBC report as so adjusted is referred to as an "adjusted RBC report.''

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All RBC reports, to the extent the information therein is not required to be set forth in a publicly available annual statement schedule, and RBC plans, including the results or report of any examination or analysis of an insurer performed pursuant hereto and any corrective order issued by the commissioner pursuant to examination or analysis, with respect to any domestic insurer or foreign insurer which are filed with the commissioner constitute information that might be damaging to the insurer if made available to its competitors, and therefore shall be kept confidential by the commissioner.

II. It is the judgment of the legislature that the comparison of an insurer's total adjusted capital to any of its RBC levels is a regulatory tool which may indicate the need for possible corrective action with respect to the insurer, and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally.  Therefore, except as otherwise required under the provisions of this chapter, the making, publishing, disseminating, circulating, or placing before the public, or causing, directly or indirectly to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in a newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio or television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement, or statement containing an assertion, representation, or statement with regard to the RBC levels of any insurer, or of any component derived in the calculation, by any insurer, agent, broker, or other person engaged in any manner in the insurance business would be misleading and is therefore prohibited;  provided, however, that if any materially false statement with respect to the comparison regarding an insurer's total adjusted capital to its RBC levels, or any of them, or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the insurer's RBC levels is published in any written publication and the insurer is able to demonstrate to the commissioner with substantial proof the falsity of such statement, or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the insurer may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is the further judgment of the legislature that the RBC instructions, RBC reports, adjusted RBC reports, RBC plans and revised RBC plans are intended solely for use by the commissioner in monitoring the solvency of insurers and the need for possible corrective action with respect to insurers and shall not be used by the commissioner for ratemaking nor considered or introduced as evidence in any rate proceeding nor used by the commissioner to calculate or derive any elements of an appropriate premium level or rate of return for any line of insurance which an insurer or any affiliate is authorized to write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-F:10 Foreign Insurers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any foreign insurer shall, upon the written request of the commissioner, submit to the commissioner an RBC report as of the end of the calendar year just ended the later of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The date an RBC report would be required to be filed by a domestic insurer under this chapter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fifteen days after the request is received by the foreign insurer.  Any foreign insurer shall, at the written request of the commissioner, promptly submit to the commissioner a copy of any RBC plan that is filed with the insurance commissioner of any other state.
<br>

II. In the event of a company action level event, regulatory action level event, or authorized control level event with respect to any foreign insurer as determined under the RBC statute applicable in the state of domicile of the insurer or, if no RBC statute is in force in that state, under the provisions of this chapter, if the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile of the foreign insurer fails to require the foreign insurer to file an RBC plan in the manner specified under that state's RBC statute, or, if no RBC statute is in force in that state, under RSA 404-F:3, the commissioner may require the foreign insurer to file an RBC plan with the commissioner.  In such event, the failure of the foreign insurer to file an RBC plan with the commissioner shall be grounds to order the insurer to cease and desist from writing new insurance business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event of a mandatory control level event with respect to any foreign insurer, if no domiciliary receiver has been appointed with respect to the foreign insurer under the rehabilitation and liquidation statute applicable in the state of domicile of the foreign insurer, the commissioner may make application to the superior court permitted under RSA 402-C with respect to the liquidation of property of foreign insurers found in this state, and the occurrence of the mandatory control level event shall be considered adequate grounds for the application.
