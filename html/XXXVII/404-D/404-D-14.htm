&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:14 Miscellaneous Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Records shall be kept of all negotiations and meetings in which the association or its representatives are involved to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under RSA 404-D:8.  Records of such negotiations or meetings shall be made public only upon the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired insurer, upon the termination of the impairment of the insurer, or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under RSA 404-D:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to RSA 404-D:8, IX.  All assets of the impaired insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired insurer as required by this chapter.  Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this paragraph, is that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserve that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In distributing assets the following factors shall be considered:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders and policy owners of the impaired insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of such impaired insurer.  In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders of the continuing or successor insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of assessments levied by the association with respect to such insurer have been fully recovered by the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. It shall be a prohibited unfair trade practice for any person to make use in any manner of the protection afforded by this chapter in the sale of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The recovery procedure shall provide that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the 5 years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b) to (d).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No such dividend shall be recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he received.  Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately.  If 2 persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The maximum amount recoverable under this section shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer on a fair and equitable basis, as determined by the commissioner under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If any person liable under paragraph (c) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the dividend was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.
