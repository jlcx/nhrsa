The association may require an assignment to it of such rights by any payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any rights or benefits conferred by this chapter upon such person.  The association shall be subrogated to these rights against the assets of any impaired insurer.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) The subrogation rights of the association under this paragraph shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX. The contractual obligations of the impaired insurer for which the association becomes or may become liable shall be as great as but no greater than the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer would have been in the absence of the impairment, except for such contractual obligations of the impaired insurer which the commissioner finds are not fair and equitable, for which the association will become liable only on conditions determined by the commissioner to be fair and equitable, including without limitation, the imposition of policy or contract liens, moratoriums or similar means which the commissioner determines to be fair and equitable.
