&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:2 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to maintain public confidence in the promises of insurers by providing a mechanism for protecting policyowners, insureds, beneficiaries, annuitants, payees, and assignees of life insurance policies, health insurance policies, annuity contracts, and supplemental contracts, against failure in the performance of fair and equitable contractual obligations due to the impairment of the insurer issuing such policies or contracts.  To provide this protection:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An association of insurers is created to enable the guaranty of payment of benefits and of continuation of coverages;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Members of the association are subject to assessment to provide funds to carry out the purpose of this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The association is authorized to assist the commissioner, in the prescribed manner, in the detection and prevention of insurer impairments.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Guarantee, assume, or reinsure, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed or reinsured the covered policies of the impaired insurer;  provided, however, if the commissioner finds that certain contractual obligations of the covered policies are not fair and equitable, then the association may, subject to the approval of the commissioner, only guarantee, assume or reinsure such contractual obligations of the covered policies on conditions which are fair and equitable;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

If the association fails to act within a reasonable period of time, the commissioner shall have the powers and duties of the association under this chapter with respect to such domestic impaired insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a foreign or alien insurer is an impaired insurer under an order of liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation, the association shall, subject to the approval of the commissioner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Guarantee, assume, or reinsure or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, or reinsured the covered policies of residents;  provided, however, if the commissioner finds that certain contractual obligations of the covered policies are not fair and equitable, then the association may, subject to the approval of the commissioner, only guarantee, assume or reinsure contractual obligations of the covered policies on conditions which are fair and equitable;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) In carrying out its duties under paragraphs III and IV, the association may request that there be imposed policy liens, contract liens, moratoriums on payments, or other similar means and such liens, moratoriums, or similar means may be imposed if the commissioner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Finds that the amounts which can be assessed under this chapter are less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the impaired insurer's contractual obligations, or that the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of policy or contract liens, moratoriums or similar means to be in the public interest, or that the imposition of policy or contract liens, moratoriums or similar means is fair and equitable, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Approves the specific policy liens, contract liens, moratoriums, or similar means to be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Before being obligated under paragraphs III and IV the association may request that there be imposed temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans and such temporary moratoriums and liens may be imposed if they are approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The association may render assistance and advice to the commissioner, upon his request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuations of coverage, or the performance of other contractual obligations of any impaired insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The association shall have standing to appear before any court in this state with jurisdiction over an impaired insurer concerning which the association is or may become obligated under this chapter.  Such standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association, including, but not limited to, proposals for reinsuring or guaranteeing the covered policies of the impaired insurer and the determination of the covered policies and contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Assignment of rights occurs when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any person receiving benefits under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned his rights under the covered policy to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter whether the benefits are payments of contractual obligations or continuation of coverage.  The association may require an assignment to it of such rights by any payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any rights or benefits conferred by this chapter upon such person.  The association shall be subrogated to these rights against the assets of any impaired insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The subrogation rights of the association under this paragraph shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The contractual obligations of the impaired insurer for which the association becomes or may become liable shall be as great as but no greater than the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer would have been in the absence of the impairment, except for such contractual obligations of the impaired insurer which the commissioner finds are not fair and equitable, for which the association will become liable only on conditions determined by the commissioner to be fair and equitable, including without limitation, the imposition of policy or contract liens, moratoriums or similar means which the commissioner determines to be fair and equitable.  In no event shall the aggregate liability of the association exceed $100,000 in cash values, or $300,000 for all benefits, including cash values, with respect to any one life.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The association may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper for recovery of any unpaid assessments under RSA 404-D:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter.  Any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic insurers and may be carried as admitted assets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Negotiate and contract with any liquidator, rehabilitator, conservator, or ancillary receiver to carry out the powers and duties of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:9 Assessments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such times and for such amounts as the board finds necessary.  The board shall collect the assessments after 30 days' written notice to the member insurers before payment is due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There shall be 3 classes of assessments, as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Class A assessments shall be made for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other general expenses not related to a particular impaired insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class B assessments shall be made to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under RSA 404-D:8 with regard to an impaired domestic insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class C assessments shall be made to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under RSA 404-D:8 with regard to an impaired foreign or alien insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Assessments shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount of any Class A assessment for each account shall be determined by the board.  The amount of any Class B or C assessment shall be divided among the accounts in the proportion that the premiums received by the impaired insurer on the policies covered by each account bear to the premiums received by such insurer on all covered policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class A and Class C assessments against member insurers for each account shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each account bear to such premiums received on business in this state by all assessed member insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class B assessments for each account shall be made separately for each state in which the impaired domestic insurer was authorized to transact insurance at any time, in the proportion that the premiums received on business in such state by the impaired insurer on policies covered by such account bear to such premiums received in all such states by the impaired insurer.  The assessments against member insurers shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in each such state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each account bear to such premiums received on business in each state by all assessed member insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired insurer shall not be made until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.  Classification of assessments under paragraph II and computation of assessments under this paragraph shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.  The total of all assessments upon a member insurer for each account shall not in any one calendar year exceed 4 percent of such insurer's premiums in this state on the policies covered by the account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated (or deferred), in whole or in part, because of the limitations set forth in paragraph IV, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred, shall be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section.  If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in either account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that amount, including assets accruing from net realized gains and income from investments.  A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses if refunds are impractical.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, for the amount so paid.  All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue.  A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the commissioner may approve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:10 Plan of Operation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Such rules shall continue in force until modified by the commissioner or superseded by a plan submitted by the association and approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All member insurers shall comply with the plan of operation.

(a) Establish procedures for handling the assets of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the association, except those under RSA 404-D:8, XI(c) and RSA 404-D:9, are delegated to a corporation, association, or other organization which performs or will perform functions similar to those of this association, or its equivalent, in 2 or more states.  Such a corporation, association, or organization shall be reimbursed for any payments made on behalf of the association and shall be paid for its performance of any function of the association.  A delegation under this paragraph shall take effect only with the approval of both the board of directors and the commissioner, and may be made only to a corporation, association, or organization which extends protection not substantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:11 Duties and Powers of the Commissioner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In addition to the duties and powers enumerated elsewhere in this chapter,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Notify the board of directors of the existence of an impaired insurer not later than 3 days after a determination of impairment is made or he receives notice of impairment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the association with a statement of the premiums in the appropriate states for each member insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When an impairment is declared and the amount of the impairment is determined, serve a demand upon the impaired insurer to make good the impairment within a reasonable time.  Notice to the impaired insurer shall constitute notice to its shareholders, if any.  The failure of the insurer to promptly comply with such demand shall not excuse the association from the performance of its powers and duties under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In any liquidation or rehabilitation proceeding involving a domestic insurer, be appointed as the liquidator or rehabilitator.  If a foreign or alien member insurer is subject to a liquidation proceeding in its domiciliary jurisdiction or state of entry, the commissioner may be appointed conservator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.  As an alternative the commissioner may levy a forfeiture on any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due.  Such forfeiture shall not exceed 5 percent of the unpaid assessment per month, but no forfeiture shall be less than $100 per month.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:12 Prevention of Impairments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
To aid in the detection and prevention of insurer impairments, the commissioner shall be notified when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board of directors shall, upon majority vote, notify the commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be unable or potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, request that the commissioner order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be unable or potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations.  The commissioner may conduct such examination.  The examination may be conducted as a national association of insurance commissioners examination or may be conducted by such persons as the commissioner designates.  The cost of such examination shall be paid by the association and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports.  In no event shall such examination report be released to the board of directors of the association prior to its release to the public, but this shall not excuse the commissioner from his obligation to comply with paragraph III.  The commissioner shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed.  The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the commissioner but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public and shall be released at that time only if the examination discloses that the examined insurer is unable or potentially unable to meet its contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall report to the board of directors when he has reasonable cause to believe that any member or licensed insurer may be unable or potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make reports and recommendations to the commissioner upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member insurer.  Such reports and recommendations shall not be subject to RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the commissioner for the detection and prevention of insurer impairments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board of directors shall, at the conclusion of any insurer impairment in which the association carried out its duties under this chapter or exercised any of its powers under this chapter, prepare a report on the history and causes of such impairment, based on the information available to the association, and submit such report to the commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:14 Miscellaneous Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Records shall be kept of all negotiations and meetings in which the association or its representatives are involved to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under RSA 404-D:8.  Records of such negotiations or meetings shall be made public only upon the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired insurer, upon the termination of the impairment of the insurer, or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under RSA 404-D:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to RSA 404-D:8, IX.  All assets of the impaired insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired insurer as required by this chapter.  Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this paragraph, is that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserve that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In distributing assets the following factors shall be considered:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders and policy owners of the impaired insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of such impaired insurer.  In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders of the continuing or successor insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of assessments levied by the association with respect to such insurer have been fully recovered by the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. It shall be a prohibited unfair trade practice for any person to make use in any manner of the protection afforded by this chapter in the sale of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The recovery procedure shall provide that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the 5 years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b) to (d).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No such dividend shall be recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he received.  Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately.  If 2 persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The maximum amount recoverable under this section shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer on a fair and equitable basis, as determined by the commissioner under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If any person liable under paragraph (c) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the dividend was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.
