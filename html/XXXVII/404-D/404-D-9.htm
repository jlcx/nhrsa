&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-D:9 Assessments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such times and for such amounts as the board finds necessary.  The board shall collect the assessments after 30 days' written notice to the member insurers before payment is due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There shall be 3 classes of assessments, as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Class A assessments shall be made for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other general expenses not related to a particular impaired insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class B assessments shall be made to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under RSA 404-D:8 with regard to an impaired domestic insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class C assessments shall be made to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under RSA 404-D:8 with regard to an impaired foreign or alien insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Assessments shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount of any Class A assessment for each account shall be determined by the board.  The amount of any Class B or C assessment shall be divided among the accounts in the proportion that the premiums received by the impaired insurer on the policies covered by each account bear to the premiums received by such insurer on all covered policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class A and Class C assessments against member insurers for each account shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each account bear to such premiums received on business in this state by all assessed member insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class B assessments for each account shall be made separately for each state in which the impaired domestic insurer was authorized to transact insurance at any time, in the proportion that the premiums received on business in such state by the impaired insurer on policies covered by such account bear to such premiums received in all such states by the impaired insurer.  The assessments against member insurers shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in each such state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each account bear to such premiums received on business in each state by all assessed member insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired insurer shall not be made until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.  Classification of assessments under paragraph II and computation of assessments under this paragraph shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.  The total of all assessments upon a member insurer for each account shall not in any one calendar year exceed 4 percent of such insurer's premiums in this state on the policies covered by the account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated (or deferred), in whole or in part, because of the limitations set forth in paragraph IV, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred, shall be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section.  If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in either account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that amount, including assets accruing from net realized gains and income from investments.  A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses if refunds are impractical.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, for the amount so paid.  All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue.  A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the commissioner may approve.
