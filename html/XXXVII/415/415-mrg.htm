&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No policy of accident and sickness insurance shall be delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The entire money and other considerations therefor are expressed therein;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The time at which the insurance takes effect and terminates is expressed therein;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3)(a) It purports to insure only one person, except that a policy may, at the election of the carrier, insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any 2 or more eligible members of that family, including husband, wife, dependent children, or any other person dependent on the policyholder.  In the event a carrier elects to provide coverage for dependent children, the term "dependent child'' shall include a subscriber's child by blood or by law, who is under age 26.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to require:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Coverage for services provided to a dependent before the effective date of this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) That an employer pay all or part of the cost of family coverage that includes a dependent as provided pursuant to this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A subscriber that elects family coverage during any applicable open enrollment period may enroll any dependent eligible pursuant to this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Coverage for a dependent provided pursuant to this subparagraph shall be provided until the earlier of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The dependent is disqualified for dependent status as set forth in subparagraph I(3)(a);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The date upon which the employer under whose contract coverage is provided to a dependent ceases to provide coverage to the subscriber.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to permit a health insurance carrier to refuse an election for coverage by a dependent pursuant to subparagraph (c), based upon the dependent's prior disqualification pursuant to subparagraph (d)(1).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Notice regarding coverage for a dependent as provided pursuant to this subparagraph shall be provided to a subscriber:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Within 30 days following the effective date of this subparagraph.  Such notice shall include information regarding the required special open enrollment period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3-a)(a) The coverage of any family member insured by such policy, pursuant to subparagraph (3), who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his or her own living on the date as of which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as said dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the policyholder or the employee or his or her estate is chargeable for the care of said dependent, provided that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this subparagraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the coverage for dependent children under subparagraph (3) includes coverage for dependent children who are full-time students, as defined by the appropriate educational institution, beyond the age of 18, such dependent coverage shall include coverage for a dependent's medically necessary leave of absence from school for a period not to exceed 12 months or the date on which coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy, whichever comes first.  Any breaks in the school semester shall not disqualify the dependent child from coverage under this subparagraph.  Documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be submitted to the insurer by the student's attending physician and shall be considered prima facie evidence of entitlement to coverage under this subparagraph.  The date of the documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be the date the insurance coverage under this subparagraph commences;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The style, arrangement and over-all appearance of the policy give no undue prominence to any portion of the text, and unless every printed portion of the text of the policy and of any indorsements or attached papers is plainly printed in light-faced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform and not less than 10-point with a lower-case unspaced alphabet length not less than 120-point (the "text'' shall include all printed matter except the name and address of the insurer, name or title of the policy, the brief description if any, and captions and subcaptions);  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The exceptions and reductions of indemnity are set forth in the policy, and, except those which are set forth in RSA 415:6, are printed, at the insurer's option, either included with the benefit provision to which they apply, or under an appropriate caption such as "Exceptions,'' or "Exceptions and Reductions,'' provided that if an exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the policy, a statement of such exception or reduction shall be included with the benefit provision to which it applies;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Each such form, including riders and endorsements, shall be identified by a form number in the lower left-hand corner of the first page thereof;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) It contains no provision purporting to make any portion of the charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws of the insurer a part of the policy unless such portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or classification of risks, or short-rate table filed with the commissioner;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) Wherever such policy provides for reimbursement for any service which may be legally performed by a person licensed in this state for the practice of osteopathy, chiropractic, podiatry, optometry, or licensed as an advanced practice registered nurse, said policy contains a provision for reimbursement for such service when performed by a person so licensed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) Notwithstanding any provisions in any such policy or contract for the provision of health care services or benefits provided by any health, medical or other service corporation licensed by the state, whenever the terms "physician'' or "doctor'' are used in any such policy or contract, said terms shall include within their meaning those persons licensed under RSA 317-A in respect to any care, services, procedures or benefits covered by said policy or contract which the persons so licensed are authorized to perform.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) It also conforms to the relevant provisions of RSA 420-G.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any policy is issued by an insurer domiciled in this state for delivery to a person residing in another state, and if the official having responsibility for the administration of the insurance laws of such other state shall have advised the commissioner that any such policy is not subject to approval or disapproval by such official, the commissioner may by ruling require that such policy meet the standards set forth in paragraph I of this section and in RSA 415:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nonrenewable, individual health insurance policies which provide medical, hospital, or major medical expense benefits for a specified term may be delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state for purposes of providing short-term, interim coverage only and no such policy shall provide coverage for a specified term in excess of 6 months, nor shall any such policy be issued in this state to a person who was previously covered under short-term medical policies providing in total more than 540 days of coverage within the preceding 24-month period.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415:6 Accident and Sickness Policy Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Required Provisions.  Except as provided in paragraph III of this section each such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain the provisions specified in this paragraph in the words in which the same appear in this section;  provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, substitute for one or more of such provisions corresponding provisions of different wording approved by the commissioner which are in each instance not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  Such provisions shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A provision as follows:  Entire Contract;  Changes:  This policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of insurance.  No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or attached hereto.  No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A provision as follows:  Time Limit on Certain Defenses:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) After 2 years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such 2-year period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such initial 2-year period, nor to limit the application of RSA 415:6, II(1)-(5) in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation or other insurance.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer's option) under the caption "Incontestable'':  After this policy has been in force for a period of 2 years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the application.) 
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after 2 years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A provision as follows:  Grace Period:  A grace period of __________ (insert a number not less than "7'' for weekly premium policies, "10'' for monthly premium policies and "31'' for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the policy shall continue in force.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add at the end of the above provision,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the cancellation provision hereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Unless not less than 5 days prior to the premium due date the insurer has delivered to the insured or has mailed to his last address as shown by the records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted,).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A provision as follows:  Reinstatement:  If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy;  provided, however, that if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application.  The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained on or after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin on or after the date of reinstatement.  In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.  Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4-a) With respect to policies subject to RSA 420-G, a provision as follows:  Reinstatement:  If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent payment of the premium to the insurer or to any agent duly authorized by the insurer to receive such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy;  provided, however, that if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon receipt of such application by the insurer or such agent.  The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained on or after the date of reinstatement and loss due to sickness as may begin on or after the date of reinstatement.  In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium.  Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A provision as follows:  Notice of Claim:  Written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible.  Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at __________ (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at least 2 years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the first and second sentences of the above provision:  Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least 2 years, he shall, at least once in every 6 months after having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability, except in the event of legal incapacity.  The period of 6 months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.  Delay in the giving of such notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of 6 months preceding the date on which such notice is actually given.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A provision as follows:  Claim Forms:  The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss.  If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) A provision as follows:  Proofs of Loss:  Written proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within one year after the date of such loss in the case of a Medicare supplement insurance policy and within 90 days after the date of such loss in the case of any other accident and health insurance policy.  Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A provision as follows:  Time of Payment of Claims:  Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such loss.  Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid ___ (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) A provision as follows:  Payment of Claims:  Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.  If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured.  Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to such estate.  All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $ ___ (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1000), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto.  Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services;  but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) A provision as follows:  Physical Examinations and Autopsy:  The insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(11) A provision as follows:  Legal Actions:  No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy.  No such action shall be brought after the expiration of 3 years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(12) A provision as follows:  Change of Beneficiary:  Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The first clause of this provision, relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's option.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(13) A provision as follows:  Loss of Time Benefits:  If loss of time benefits payable to the insured are reduced by reason of benefits payable to the insured under the federal Social Security Act, such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the first month that benefits are payable for a period of disability;  except that if benefits under the policy are provided on a specified dollar amount basis, then such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the effective date of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(14) Refund upon cancellation:  After the policy has been continued beyond its original term, the insured may cancel the policy at any time by written notice, delivered or mailed to the insurer or the insurer's representative.  Such cancellation shall become effective upon receipt by the insurer or the insurer's representative, or on such later date as may be specified in such notice by the insured.  If the insured cancels, the insurer shall promptly return any unearned portion of the premium paid, but in any event shall return the unearned portion of the premium within 30 days.  The earned premium shall be computed on a pro-rata basis.  Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of the cancellation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(15) A provision as follows:  Pre-certification:  In the event that a person is covered by more than one plan that requires pre-certification, the member shall obtain pre-certification from the primary plan.  Although the member shall not be required to obtain pre-certification from the secondary plan, the secondary plan shall not be required to treat such services as covered services if the services do not meet its certification criteria.  The secondary plan shall not refuse payment for such services solely on the basis that the services were not pre-certified by the secondary plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Other Provisions.  Except as provided in paragraph III of this section, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this section;  provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the commissioner which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A provision as follows:  Change of Occupation:  If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation.  If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro-rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent.  In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued;  but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A provision as follows:  Misstatement of Age:  If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A provision as follows:  Other Insurance in This Insurer:  If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for ___(insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $ ___ (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or to his estate.
<br>
or, in lieu thereof:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A provision in all nongroup policies as follows:  Insurance with Other Insurers:  If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or an expense incurred basis, payment shall not be prorated or reduced.  If such a case, the insured shall be entitled to payment from both insurers.  Provided, however, that the provisions of this subparagraph shall not prohibit the issuance of a "benefits deductible'' on policies determined by the insurance commissioner as major medical policies.  The term "benefits deductible'', as used herein, means the value of any benefits provided on an expense incurred basis which are provided with respect to covered medical expenses by any other hospital, surgical or medical insurance policy or hospital or medical service subscriber contract or medical practice or other prepayment plan, or any other plan or program whether on an insured or uninsured basis.  Provided, however, that the term "benefits deductible'' shall not mean the value of benefits provided with respect to medical or liability insurance offered under either a general liability insurance policy or an auto insurance policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A provision in all non-group policies as follows:  Insurance with Other Insurers:  If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis, payment shall not be prorated or reduced.  In such a case, the insured shall be entitled to payment from both insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A provision as follows:  Relation of Earnings to Insurance:  If the total monthly amount of loss time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of 2 years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such 2 years as shall exceed the pro-rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder;  but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.  The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "valid loss of time coverage,'' approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner or any combination of such coverages.  In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) A provision as follows:  Unpaid Premium:  Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A provision as follows:  Cancellation;  Refusal to Renew:  The insurer may refuse to renew on the policy anniversary date, or may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to the insured's last address as shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than 30 days thereafter, such cancellation or refusal to renew shall be effective.  If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro-rata.  Cancellation or refusal to renew shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of the cancellation or refusal to renew.  However, such cancellation or refusal to renew, if for reasons other than nonpayment of premium and other than specified in any time limits for certain defenses, shall be effected only if also effected on all policyholders of the same class.  No such action shall be taken without prior written approval of the insurance commissioner.  The insurer shall have the burden of proof that the classification of risk involved therein is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, pursuant to RSA 415:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) A provision as follows:  Conformity with State Statutes:  Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such statutes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Inapplicable or Inconsistent Provisions.  If any provision of this section is in whole or in part inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy, the insurer, with the approval of the commissioner, shall omit from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage provided by the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Order of Certain Policy Provisions.  The provisions which are the subject of paragraphs I and II of this section, or any corresponding provisions which are used in lieu thereof in accordance with such paragraphs shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such paragraphs or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered or issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Third Party Ownership.  The word "insured,'' as used in this chapter, shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits and rights provided therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Requirements of Other Jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any policy of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state, may contain any provision which is not less favorable to the insured or the beneficiary than the provisions of this chapter and which is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is organized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any policy of a domestic insurer may, when issued for delivery in any other state or country, contain any provision permitted or required by the laws of such other state or country.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Filing Procedure.  The commissioner may make such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to this chapter as are necessary, proper or advisable to the administration of this chapter.  This provision shall not abridge any other authority granted the commissioner by law.

I. No insurer that issues or renews any individual policy of accident or health insurance providing benefits for medical or hospital expenses and providing coverage for prescription drugs shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Exclude coverage for any such drug for a particular indication on the ground that the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that indication, if such drug is recognized for treatment of such indication in one of the standard reference compendia or in the medical literature;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) As a condition of coverage, impose use of an alternative drug not approved by the FDA for the indication being treated, unless such alternative drug is recognized for treatment of such indication in one of the standard reference compendia or in the medical literature.  An override of such condition of coverage shall be expeditiously granted consistent with RSA 420-J:7-b, II whenever the prescriber can demonstrate that the alternative drug:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Has been ineffective in the treatment of the insured's medical condition in the past;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Is expected to be ineffective based on the known relevant physical or mental characteristics of the insured and the known characteristics of the drug regimen;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Each insurer that issues or renews any individual policy of accident or health insurance providing benefits for medical or hospital expenses for its insured persons shall pay for services rendered by New Hampshire health care providers within 30 calendar days upon receipt of a clean non-electronic claim or 15 calendar days upon receipt of a clean electronic claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When the insurer is denying or pending the claim, the insurer shall have 15 calendar days upon receipt of an electronic claim or 30 days upon receipt of a non-electronic claim to notify the health care provider or certificate holder of the reason for denying or pending the claim and what, if any, additional information is required to adjudicate the claim.  Upon the insurer's receipt of the requested additional information, the insurer shall adjudicate the claim within 45 calendar days.  If the required notice is not provided, the claim shall be treated as a clean claim and shall be adjudicated pursuant to subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Payment of a claim shall be considered to be made on the date a check was issued or electronically transferred.  The insurer shall mail checks no later than 5 business days after the date a check was issued.  Failure to mail a check within 5 business days shall constitute a violation subject to enforcement under RSA 415:20.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The insurer's failure to comply with the time limits in this section shall not have the effect of requiring coverage for an otherwise non-covered claim.  This section shall only apply to payments made on a claims basis and shall not apply to capitation or other forms of periodic payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Clean claim'' means a claim for payment of covered health care expenses that is submitted to an insurer on the insurer's standard claim form using the most current published procedural codes, with all the required fields completed with correct and complete information in accordance with the insurer's published filing requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Electronic claim'' means the transmission of data for purposes of payment of covered health care services in an electronic data format specified by the insurer and, if covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is in such form and substance as to be in compliance with such act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any initial clean claim submission not paid within the time periods specified in subparagraph I(a) shall be deemed overdue.  In that case:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The insurer shall pay the health care provider or the insured person the amount of the overdue claim plus an interest payment of 1.5 percent per month beginning from the date the payment was due;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The health care provider may recover from the insurer, upon a judicial finding of bad faith, reasonable attorney's fees for advising and representing a health care provider in a successful action against an insurer for payment of the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Exceptions to the requirements of this section are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No insurer shall be in violation of this section for a claim submitted by a health care provider if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The insurer is in liquidation or rehabilitation or is operating in compliance with a court-ordered plan of rehabilitation;  or

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No insurer shall be in violation of this section for any claim submitted more than 90 days after the service was rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No insurer shall be in violation of this section while the claim is pending due to a fraud investigation that has been reported to a state or federal agency, or an internal or external review process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may assess an administrative fine against any insurer or may suspend or revoke the license or certificate of authority of any insurer after determining that the insurer has established a pattern of overdue payments and that the contemplated enforcement action would not promote the deterioration of the financial condition of an at-risk insurer.  Such fine shall not exceed $300,000 per calendar year examined.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to alter the commissioner's authority to investigate or take action, including, but not limited to, action pursuant to RSA 415:20, in response to individual instances of noncompliance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415:6-i Retroactive Denials Prohibited;  Exceptions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "retroactive denial of a previously paid claim'' means any attempt by an insurer to retroactively collect payments already made to a health care provider with respect to a claim by requiring repayment of such payments, reducing other payments currently owed to the provider, withholding or setting off against future payments, or reducing or affecting the future claim payments to the provider in any other manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No insurer shall impose on any health care provider any retroactive denial of a previously paid claim or any part thereof unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The insurer has provided the reason for the retroactive denial in writing to the health care provider;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The time which has elapsed since the date of payment of the challenged claim does not exceed 18 months.  The retroactive denial of a previously paid claim may be permitted beyond 18 months from the date of payment only for the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The claim was submitted fraudulently;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The claim payment was incorrect because the health care provider or the insured was already paid for the health care services identified in the claim;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The health care services identified in the claim were not delivered by the health care provider;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The claim payment was for services covered by Title XVIII, Title XIX, or Title XXI of the Social Security Act;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The claim payment is the subject of an adjustment with a different insurer, administrator, or payor and such adjustment is not affected by a contractual relationship, association, or affiliation involving claims payment, processing, or pricing;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The claim payment is the subject of legal action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An insurer shall notify a health care provider at least 15 days in advance of the imposition of any retroactive denials of previously paid claims.  The health care provider shall have 6 months from the date of notification under this paragraph to determine whether the insured has other appropriate insurance, which was in effect on the date of service.  Notwithstanding the contractual terms between the insurer and provider, the insurer shall allow for the submission of a claim that was previously denied by another insurer due to the insured's transfer or termination of coverage.

I. Policies, certificates and other forms attached to group or blanket accident or health insurance, or accident and health insurance, shall comply with all applicable laws, including RSA 420-G, and with rules adopted by the commissioner.  No such policy or certificate shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state to a resident of this state without the prior written approval of the commissioner.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, establishing conditions by which insurers may deem such policies or certificate forms approved upon the expiration of a 30-day period following the commissioner's receipt of the insurer's submission of the policy and certificate forms for approval.  No policy of group or blanket accident or health insurance, or accident and health insurance affecting a resident of New Hampshire, whether such policy is delivered or issued for delivery in this state or any other state, and no certificate thereunder shall, except as provided in paragraph III of this section, be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the policy or certificate contains in substance each and all of the provisions set forth in the following subparagraphs or provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are more favorable to the holders of such certificates or not less favorable to the holders of such certificates and more favorable to policyholders:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A provision that no statement made by the applicant for insurance shall avoid the insurance or reduce benefits thereunder unless contained in the written application signed by the applicant;  and a provision that no agent has authority to change the policy or to waive any of its provisions;  and that no change in the policy shall be valid unless approved by an officer of the insurer and evidenced by endorsement on the policy, or by amendment to the policy signed by the policyholder and the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A provision that all statements contained in any such application for insurance shall be deemed representations and not warranties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A provision that all new employees or new members, as the case may be, in the groups or classes eligible for such insurance must be added to such groups or classes for which they are respectively eligible.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A provision that written notice of sickness or of injury must be given to the insurer within 20 days after the date when such sickness or injury occurred.  Failure to give notice within such time shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give such notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A provision that in the case of claim for loss of time for disability, written proof of such loss must be furnished to the insurer within 30 days after the commencement of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that subsequent written proofs of the continuance of such disability must be furnished to the insurer at such intervals as the insurer may reasonably require, and that in the case of claim for any other loss, written proof of such loss must be furnished to the insurer within one year after the date of such loss in the case of a group Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate and within 90 days after the date of such loss in the case of any other group accident and health insurance policy or certificate.  Failure to furnish such proof within such time shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to furnish such proof and that such proof was furnished as soon as was reasonably possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proof of loss.  If such forms are not furnished before the expiration of 15 days after the insurer receives notice of any claim under the policy, the person making such claim shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of the policy as to proof of loss upon submitting within the time fixed in the policy for filing proof of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, character and extent of the loss for which claim is made.
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) A provision that no action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on the policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after proof of loss has been filed in accordance with the requirements of the policy and that no such action shall be brought at all unless brought within 3 years from the expiration of the time within which proof of loss is required by the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(o) A provision that if loss of time benefits payable to the holder of the certificate are reduced by reason of benefits payable to the holder of the certificate under the federal Social Security Act, such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the first month that benefits are payable for a period of disability;  except that if benefits under the policy are provided on a specified dollar amount basis, then such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the effective date of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(p) A provision that the policyholder is entitled to a grace period of 31 days for the payment of any premium due except the first, during which grace period the coverage shall continue in force, unless the policyholder has given the insurer written notice of discontinuance in advance of the period for which payment is due, and in accordance with the terms of the policy.  The policy may provide that the policyholder shall be liable to the insurer for the payment of a portion of the premium corresponding to the time within the grace period during which the policy was in force.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(q) A provision that the insurer shall not exclude part-time employees and shall offer the same group health benefits to part-time employees as it offers to the employee groups of which the part-time employees would be members if they were full-time employees.  The insurer shall offer to include the part-time employees as part of the employer's employee group, at the full rate to be paid by the employer, at a rate prorated between the employer and the employee, or at the employee's expense.  A part-time employee shall be any employee who regularly works at least half of the weekly hours of the full-time employee in the employee group of which the part-time employee would be a member if he were a full-time employee, but who works a minimum of at least 15 hours per week.  An insurer, however, may exclude part-time employees from eligibility for group health coverages providing disability or income replacement benefits, whether short- or long-term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(r) A provision that the validity of the policy shall not be contested except for nonpayment of premiums, after it has been in force for 2 years from its date of issue;  and that no statement made by any person covered under the policy relating to insurability shall be used in contesting the validity of the insurance with respect to which such statement was made after such insurance has been in force prior to the contest for a period of 2 years during such person's lifetime, nor unless it is contained in a written instrument signed by the person making such statement.  No such provision, however, shall preclude the assertion, at any time, of defenses based upon the person's ineligibility for coverage under the policy or upon other provisions in the policy, except for any provisions establishing, as a requirement of eligibility, the furnishing of satisfactory evidence of insurability to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(s) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(t) A provisions as follows:  Payment of Claims.  Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.  If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured.  Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to such estate.  All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.  (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If any indemnity of this policy or certificate shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $ (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto.  Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy or certificate on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services;  but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(u) A provision that in the event that a person is covered by more than one plan that requires pre-certification, the member shall obtain pre-certification from the primary plan.  Although the member shall not be required to obtain pre-certification from the secondary plan, the secondary plan shall not be required to treat such services as covered services if the services do not meet its certification criteria.  The secondary plan shall not refuse payment for such services solely on the basis that the services were not pre-certified by the secondary plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. "Blanket accident and health insurance'' means that form of accident and health insurance that is not "health coverage'' under RSA 420-G:2, IX, that does not require individual applications from covered persons, and that does not require a carrier to furnish each person with a certificate of coverage.  Blanket health coverage shall be issued only to the following groups and cover only the following defined persons in the groups:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A common carrier, which shall be deemed the policyholder, and which shall cover a group defined as all or any of the class of persons who may become passengers on such a common carrier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An employer, which shall be deemed the policyholder, and which shall cover all employees or any subset of employees defined solely by reference to exceptional hazards incident to such employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A volunteer fire department, first aid, or other such volunteer group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, and which shall cover all the members of such department or group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A sports team or a camp, which team or camp shall be deemed the policyholder and which shall cover all members or campers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A travel agency, or other organization that provides travel-related services, which organization shall be deemed the policyholder and which shall cover all persons for whom travel-related services are provided.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, blanket accident and health coverage for travel-related services issued to a travel agency or to an organization that provides travel-related services may require individual applications or enrollment forms from covered persons and premium payments from covered persons, and the carrier may furnish each covered person with a summary of benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A school, institution of higher education, or other educational organization, which shall be deemed the policyholder and which shall cover all persons who are students, employees, or unpaid volunteers performing services for the policyholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. The benefits payable under blanket accident and health insurance shall not be assigned to a health care provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any portion of any policy of group or blanket accident or health insurance affecting a resident of New Hampshire, whether such policy is delivered in this state or any other state, and any certificate under such policy, which purports, by reason of the circumstances under which a loss is incurred, to reduce any benefits promised thereunder to an amount less than that provided for the same loss occurring under ordinary circumstances, shall be printed, in such policy and in each certificate issued under such policy, in boldface type and with greater prominence than any other portion of the text of such policy or certificate, respectively;  and all other exceptions of the policy shall be printed in the policy and in the certificate, with the same prominence as the benefits to which they apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may approve any form of blanket accident or health or accident and health insurance policy, or any form of certificate to be issued under such policy, which omits or modifies any of the provisions hereinbefore required, if he deems such omission or modification suitable for the character of such insurance and not unjust to the persons insured thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any such group policy may include benefits payable on account of hospital or medical or surgical aid for an employee or other member of the group insured by such policy, his or her spouse, child or children or other dependents, and may provide that any such benefits be paid by the insurer directly to the hospital, physician, surgeon, doctor, nurse or other person furnishing services covered by such provision of said policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The coverage of any dependent of any employee or member of the group insured by such policy, pursuant to paragraph IV, who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his or her own living on the date as of which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another group policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as said dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the employee or member of the group or the employee or his or her estate is chargeable for the care of said dependent, provided that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the coverage for dependent children under paragraph IV includes coverage for dependent children who are full-time students, as defined by the appropriate educational institution, beyond the age of 18, such dependent coverage shall include coverage for a dependent's medically necessary leave of absence from school for a period not to exceed 12 months or the date on which coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy, whichever comes first.  Any breaks in the school semester shall not disqualify the dependent child from coverage under this subparagraph.  Documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be submitted to the insurer by the student's attending physician and shall be considered prima facie evidence of entitlement to coverage under this subparagraph.  The date of the documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be the date the insurance coverage under this subparagraph commences.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any provision of any policy of insurance issued under the provisions of this section, whenever such policy provides for reimbursement for any service which may be legally performed by a person licensed in this state for the practice of osteopathy, chiropractic, podiatry, optometry, or licensed as an advanced practice registered nurse, reimbursement under such policy shall not be denied when such service is rendered by a person so licensed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) If a group policy affecting a resident of New Hampshire is delivered or issued for delivery in this state or any other state, and such policy provides hospital or surgical expense insurance or major medical expense insurance for other than specific diseases, accidents only, or student major medical expense coverage insurance where the policyholder is the school, the policy and any certificate issued under such policy to a New Hampshire resident shall contain a provision to the effect that in case of termination for any reason whatever of coverage, including termination of eligibility for continuation coverage, provided any employee while insured under a group policy issued to his or her employer, if the employee or member is not then covered by another policy of hospital or surgical expense insurance or hospital service or medical expense indemnity corporation subscriber contract providing similar benefits or if the employee or member is not covered by or eligible to be covered by a group contract or policy providing similar benefits or is not provided with similar benefits required by any statute or provided by any welfare plan or program, the employee or member, if he or she has been insured under the group policy for at least 60 days, shall be entitled to have issued to him or her by the New Hampshire high risk pool without evidence of insurability upon application to the New Hampshire high risk pool within 31 days after such termination and upon payment of the applicable premium, an individual policy of insurance under RSA 404-G or shall be entitled to elect the 39-week extension period pursuant to RSA 415:18, XVII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The effective date of the individual policy shall be the date of the termination of the individual's insurance under the group policy.  The individual policy shall not exclude any other preexisting condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The option to obtain coverage from the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G shall also be available, upon the death of the employee or member, to the surviving spouse with respect to those family members who are then covered by the group policy, to a child solely with respect to himself or herself upon his or her attaining the limiting age of coverage under the group policy while covered as a dependent thereunder, and to a former dependent spouse upon remarriage of the group plan member.  The option to obtain coverage from the New Hampshire high risk pool shall be exercised within 31 days of the qualifying event.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Each certificate holder in the insured group shall be given written notice of the option and its duration within 30 days after the date of termination of the group contract or policy.  Such notice shall be mailed by the insurer to the certificate holder at the last address furnished to the insurer by the contract holder at the same time as the notice required by RSA 415:18, XVII is mailed.  Each certificate holder shall have the option of electing an individual policy from the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G, or the 39-week extension period provided pursuant to RSA 415:18, XVII.  The election of the 39-week extension period upon termination by any person or member shall not preclude such person or member from electing to exercise the option of obtaining coverage from the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G at the expiration of the 39-week extension period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII-a. Any employee whose compensation includes group hospital or surgical expense insurance or major medical expense insurance for other than specific diseases or accidents only the premiums for which are paid in full or in part by an employer including the state of New Hampshire, its political subdivisions, or municipal corporations, or paid by payroll deduction, may pay the premiums as they become due directly to the policyholder whenever the employee's compensation is suspended or terminated directly or indirectly as the result of a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute for a period not exceeding 6 months and at the rate and coverages as the policy provides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) During said 6-month period, the policy may not be altered or changed, except that nothing in this section shall be deemed to impair the right of the insurer to make normal decreases or increases of the premium rate upon expiration and renewal of the policy, in accordance with the provisions of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When the employee's compensation is so suspended or terminated, the employee shall be notified immediately by the policyholder in writing, by mail addressed to the address last on record with the policyholder, that the employee may pay the premiums to the policyholder as they become due as provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policyholder shall remit any premiums paid by the employees on a timely basis to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the continuation of any such group coverage to any individual employee beyond the time that he takes full-time employment with another employer;  nor shall anything herein be deemed to require continuation of the group coverage more than 6 months after compensation is suspended or terminated as the result of a labor dispute, nor to require the insurer to continue coverage as to any employee for whose coverage premiums have not been remitted in accordance with the provisions of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) After the 6-month period, the employee shall have the right to continue the benefits being continued under this paragraph for an additional 12 months as if the employee originally had elected the extension period provided by RSA 415:18, XVI and subject to the same conditions.  At the end of the additional 12 months, the employee shall have the right, if the group insurance coverage is no longer available, to obtain coverage from the high risk pool.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to group hospital and medical expense policies subject to RSA 415 and group health service plan contracts issued pursuant to RSA 420-A, and to health maintenance organization policies and plans issued pursuant to RSA 420-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII-b. Any group accident and health insurance policy covering a resident of New Hampshire shall contain the following provisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon a final decree of divorce or legal separation, if one spouse is a member of a group accident and health insurance policy, the former spouse who is a family member or eligible dependent under said policy prior to the date of the decree shall be and remain eligible for group benefits as a family member or eligible dependent under said policy, without additional premium or examination, as if said decree had not been issued.  Such eligibility shall not be required if the decree expressly provides otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The former spouse shall be eligible for coverage pursuant to this section through the member's participation in a group accident and health insurance policy, while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another group policy covering the member, until the earliest of the following events occurs:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The 3-year anniversary of the final decree of divorce or legal separation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The remarriage of the former spouse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The remarriage of the member;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The death of the member;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Such earlier time as provided by the final decree of divorce or legal separation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon the occurrence of the earliest of the events set forth in subparagraph (b), other than remarriage of the former spouse, the former spouse shall have the right to continuation coverage under RSA 415:18, XVI.  An insurance carrier may charge a premium for the former spouse's continuation coverage under this subparagraph, in accordance with RSA 415:18, XVI.  The former spouse shall request enrollment under RSA 415:18, XVI, in writing, within 30 days after the first occurring of the events set forth in subparagraph (b), provided that the former spouse may not request enrollment upon remarriage of the former spouse.  If the first occurring event is the member's remarriage or death, the former spouse may request enrollment under RSA 415:18, XVI, in writing, within 30 days after receiving notice of said event.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the event of the former spouse's remarriage, the former spouse shall notify the insurance carrier, in writing, within 30 days after the date of remarriage, and the effective date of termination of the former spouse's eligibility pursuant to this section shall be the date of remarriage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The member or former spouse shall submit to the insurance carrier evidence of the former spouse's eligibility under this section within 30 days after the final decree of divorce or legal separation.  If the group accident and health insurance policy existing as of the date of the decree is replaced by another group policy covering the member that is issued by a different insurance carrier, said carrier may request that the member or former spouse submit evidence of the former spouse's eligibility under this section within 30 days of the effective date of the member's coverage under the replacement policy.  A former spouse's coverage under the member's group accident and health insurance policy pursuant to this section shall be effective as of the date of the final decree of divorce or legal separation in the case of a then existing policy, or, in the case of a replacement policy, the effective date of the member's coverage under such policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The former spouse shall notify the insurance carrier, in writing, of any address other than the member's address to which notices and correspondence pertaining to the former spouse's coverage should be mailed, including but not limited to notice of cancellation and any right to reinstate coverage, and the carrier shall use such address until it receives written notice from the former spouse of a change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Upon termination of the eligibility of a former spouse for group coverage pursuant to this section, said former spouse may apply for individual coverage or the high risk pool, whichever is applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Eligibility of a former spouse for group coverage pursuant to this section exists independent of any right to continuation of coverage under RSA 415:18, XVI.  To the extent that there is a conflict between this paragraph and RSA 415:18, XVI with respect to eligibility for group coverage upon a final decree of nullity, divorce or legal separation, the provisions that confer greater rights on the former spouse shall apply unless the decree expressly provides otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Notwithstanding any provision of any policy of insurance issued under the provisions of this section, whenever the terms "physician'' or "doctor'' are used in any such policy, said terms shall include within their meaning those persons licensed under RSA 317-A in respect to any care, services, procedures or benefits covered by said policy which the persons so licensed are authorized to perform.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. No insurer shall, when issuing or renewing a group policy or contract of hospital or surgical expense or major medical expense insurance or any certificate under such policy or contract covered by this chapter, deny coverage or limit coverage to any resident of this state and who is principally employed in this state and to any other person who is a non-resident but who is principally employed in this state on the basis of health risk or condition except that a waiting period consistent with insurance department rules may be imposed for pre-existing medical conditions.  If an insurer accepts an application for group hospital or surgical expense or major medical expense coverage, such acceptance shall be subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the group has coverage in effect through another plan, the insurer shall accept all persons covered under the existing plan.  If the group does not have coverage in effect through another plan, the insurer shall accept all persons for which the group seeks coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Once a group policy has been issued, any person becoming eligible for coverage shall become covered by enrolling within 31 days after first becoming eligible.  Any person so enrolling shall not be required to submit evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  If a person does not enroll at this time, he is a late enrollee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Once a group policy has been issued, the insurer shall provide the group with an annual open enrollment period for late enrollees.  During the open enrollment period, any late enrollee shall be permitted to enroll without submitting any evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  For late enrollees in a large employer group only, the pre-existing condition provisions shall apply for 18 months from the date of enrollment.  However, an eligible employee or dependent shall not be considered a late enrollee if the individual:

Any group policy of health insurance that affects a resident of New Hampshire that is delivered or issued for delivery in this state or any other state shall contain a provision that allows each subscriber or member on the policy who is a resident of New Hampshire to obtain continuation coverage under this section.  Coverage shall be provided in accordance with the procedures described in this section.

(b) Continuation coverage shall be identical to the coverage provided to other similarly situated members of the group that are still covered by the plan.  The policy shall not be changed from the underlying group coverage, except that normal premium rate increases or decreases upon renewal affecting the group plan may also affect the continuation premium rate.  The effective date of continuation coverage shall be the date the individual's coverage under the group plan ceased.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Periods of coverage shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Eighteen month period--When any individual loses coverage under a group health insurance plan for any reason except dismissal from employment for gross misconduct or carrier termination, coverage shall continue subject to this section for a period of 18 months, unless the individual is eligible for coverage under subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), or (5).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Thirty-nine week period (entire group insurance termination)--Whenever the entire group is terminated, coverage shall continue subject to this section for a period of 39 weeks.  Where an individual has continuation coverage, coverage shall continue until it would have expired had the plan not been terminated or for 39 weeks, whichever occurs first.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Twenty-nine month period (disability)--An individual who is determined to be disabled within the first 60 days of the date such individual loses coverage shall be entitled to 29 months of continuation coverage.  Determination of disability shall be under Title II or XVI of the federal Social Security Act or any future act that has the same purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Thirty-six month period--Subject to subparagraph (e), coverage shall continue subject to this section for a period of 36 months if any individual loses coverage under a group health insurance plan for one of the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Death of a covered employee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The divorce or the legal separation of the covered employee or, if the employee's former spouse has been covered pursuant to RSA 415:18, VII-b, the first occurring of any of the following events:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The death of the covered employee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) The 3-year anniversary of the final decree of divorce or legal separation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) Such earlier time as provided by said decree;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) A substantial loss of coverage by retirees and dependents within one year of the employer filing for protection under the bankruptcy provisions of Title 11 of the United States Code;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) A dependent child ceasing to be a dependent child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) When the surviving spouse, divorced spouse, or legally separated spouse is 55 years of age or older and loses coverage because of the death, divorce, or legal separation of the covered employee, coverage shall continue subject to this section until such time as the spouse becomes eligible for participation in another employer-based group plan or becomes eligible for Medicare.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Premium Payments.  When an individual's coverage has ended, the amount of the premium charged to the individual electing continuation coverage shall not exceed 102 percent of the group premium amount as allocated for that individual's coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Responsibilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) When an individual loses coverage, it shall be the responsibility of the carrier to notify the individual of the right to elect continuation coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the individual electing continuation coverage to make timely premium payments.  A 30-day grace period for payment of the premium shall be provided.  Failure to make a timely remittance of the premium shall be grounds for cancellation.  Whenever a carrier fails to notify an individual that his or her coverage will not continue unless the individual so elects, the carrier shall be liable, in accordance with the terms of the policy, for claims accrued until such notice is made, except that any carrier that in good faith mailed a notice to the last known address of the individual shall not be held liable.  Such carrier's liability shall in no way diminish the liability of the employer if the employer fails to notify the carrier of a member's loss of coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Notice Requirements and Procedures.  A carrier shall notify the members and subscribers of their continuation rights as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The carrier shall provide, at the time of commencement of coverage under the health benefit plan, a summary plan description to each eligible member or subscriber of the rights provided under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Notice of the right to continue coverage also shall be set forth in each master policy and individual certificate of coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) When coverage for an individual will cease under the group policy, the carrier shall notify the individual of the individual's right to continue, the amount of the premium required to continue coverage, and the procedure for electing continuation coverage.  The notice of continuation shall specify the election period that shall not be less than 45 days after the date of the notice and shall be mailed to the last known address of the individual provided by the employer or plan administrator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The carrier shall specify in each notice of continuation how premium payments are to be remitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The carrier shall notify the individual of the right to continue coverage within 30 days of receiving notice from the plan administrator or employer of the loss of coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Election Requirements and Procedures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An individual electing continuation coverage shall notify the carrier in writing with a copy of the notice provided to the employer or plan administrator when the election is made.  Such election shall be made within 45 days of the date of notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where the employee's spouse is also covered by the group plan, and there is a divorce or legal separation, the employee shall notify the employer of the divorce or separation within 30 days, and shall provide the employer and carrier with the employee's spouse's mailing address.  In case of a divorce or legal separation, the carrier shall provide a separate notice of the right to continue to the divorced or separated spouse.  The divorced or separated spouse may elect to continue coverage pursuant to this section by notifying the carrier within 45 days of the date of the notice and remitting the premium payment.  The notice and election provisions of this paragraph shall also apply if the divorced or legally separated spouse of the employee has been covered pursuant to RSA 415:18, VII-b, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The remarriage of the employee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The death of the employee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The 3-year anniversary of the final decree of divorce or legal separation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Such earlier time as provided by the final decree of divorce or legal separation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Election by the individual shall be made within the period of time stated in the notice of the right to continue, by written notice to the carrier and the employer.  The required premium payment, as specified in the notice of the right to continue, shall be remitted as required in the notice with the written notice of election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Where an individual declines the right to continue coverage pursuant to this section, waiver shall be made by an affirmative means of declination, including but not limited to written declination of continuation coverage or electronic contact to the employer or plan administrator.  An individual shall have the right to revoke the notice of declaration anytime within the specified election period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Where proper notice has been given, and no response is made within the election period, coverage may be deemed waived if the carrier has in good faith made reasonable efforts to contact the eligible individual.  However, no carrier may deem any coverage waived if a notice does not fully comply with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Where an individual has attempted to notify the carrier, employer, or plan administrator of election, and where the written election has not included a premium payment, the carrier shall allow the individual to comply by paying the full amount of the unpaid premiums within 30 days of the date of election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Where more than one person covered by the group health insurance plan will lose coverage as a result of the covered employee's termination from the group, each individual shall be provided with a notice and shall have the opportunity to elect or waive coverage.  Where there is a choice among plans, each individual shall have the opportunity to choose a plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) An election of continuation of coverage by a subscriber shall be deemed to include an election of continuation coverage on behalf of any other of the subscriber's dependents or beneficiaries who would lose coverage under the health benefit plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) End of Continuation Coverage.  Nothing in this paragraph shall require a carrier to continue coverage pursuant to this section beyond:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The first day of the month following the individual's eligibility for a group plan through a different employer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In the case of an individual that is eligible for Medicare, the date of the first Medicare open enrollment period following the date the individual became ineligible for continued participation under the group plan;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In the case of a period of extended coverage for a person who has been determined to be disabled during the first 60 days of continuation coverage, the month that begins more than 30 days after the date of a final determination that the person is no longer disabled;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The date on which continuation coverage ceases because the individual has failed to pay the premium.  The individual shall be given a 30-day grace period before coverage is cancelled, and shall be provided with a notice within 15 days of the date of termination that the coverage will be cancelled if the premium is not paid;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The date on which the group plan terminates subject to the continuation rights set forth in RSA 415:18, XVII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to group hospital and medical expense policies subject to RSA 415, group health service plan contracts issued pursuant to RSA 420-A, and to health maintenance organization policies and plans issued pursuant to RSA 420-B, and to group policies that cover New Hampshire residents who work in other states.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to individuals covered under group policies issued to small employers of size one, as defined pursuant to RSA 420-G:2, XVI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Relationship to Federal Law.  In any circumstance where more extensive notice requirements or other procedural requirements apply, the health benefit plan shall satisfy the specific requirements of federal law with respect to those procedural requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. Termination of Coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whenever any group hospital, surgical, dental insurance plan, medical insurance plan, or health maintenance organization coverage terminates for any reason, the benefits of such plan shall be available at the same group rate to the covered members of the group plan, for an extension period of 39 weeks, or until such member of the group plan becomes eligible for benefits under another group plan, whichever occurs first.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Written notice of the right to continue such group coverage upon termination shall be given by the carrier in each master policy, certificate, and group policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon termination of the group policy for nonpayment of premiums the carrier shall give notice within 30 days of the effective date of termination of the policy to the policyholder and each certificate holder under the policy.  Termination of the group policy for nonpayment of premiums shall occur no earlier than the date of expiration of the grace period, pursuant to RSA 415:18, I(p), for which premium was due but not paid.  The notice shall provide that the certificate holder or policyholder may elect coverage from the date of termination to the date of notice;  or elect coverage from the date of termination to the date of notice and continue such coverage in force pursuant to subparagraphs (d), (e), and (f).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The member electing coverage under this subparagraph shall provide the carrier written notice of election together with the required premium contribution within 31 days of the date of the notice.  The group rate shall be paid by the member directly to the carrier.  The premium rate shall be that required for the coverage being continued and shall not exceed the applicable group rate, but a reasonable administrative fee not to exceed 2 percent of the monthly premium may be charged to offset billing and payment costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If group members become entitled to the 39-week extension period due to termination of the policy, the carrier shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Notify such person or member of the option to elect continuation of coverage for the extension period of 39 weeks and the conditions applicable to such coverage within 30 days of the date the plan terminates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the carrier fails to notify the members of the termination of the group plan within 30 days of the date of termination of the group coverage, the members shall not be liable for any premiums that have not been paid prior to the date the notice was sent.  In no event shall a person or member entitled to coverage for the extension period of 39 weeks be responsible for premiums accrued and unpaid prior to the date of the termination or cancellation of the coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Where coverage has ended as a result of an employer's nonpayment of premiums, the member electing continuation coverage shall not be liable for any accrued and unpaid premium that was the employer's responsibility under the policy, or any amount previously paid by the person for coverage under the policy that due to the employer's actions was not paid to the carrier.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may assess an administrative fine against any insurer or may suspend or revoke the license or certificate of authority of any insurer after determining that the insurer has established a pattern of overdue payments and that the contemplated enforcement action would not promote the deterioration of the financial condition of an at-risk insurer.  Such fine shall not exceed $300,000 per calendar year examined.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to alter the commissioner's authority to investigate or take action, including, but not limited to, action pursuant to RSA 415:20, in response to individual instances of noncompliance.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "retroactive denial of a previously paid claim'' means any attempt by an insurer to retroactively collect payments already made to a health care provider with respect to a claim by requiring repayment of such payments, reducing other payments currently owed to the provider, withholding or setting off against future payments, reducing or affecting the future claim payments to the provider in any other manner.

(a) The insurer has provided the reason for the retroactive denial in writing to the health care provider;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The time which has elapsed since the date of payment of the challenged claim does not exceed 18 months.  The retroactive denial of a previously paid claim may be permitted beyond 18 months from the date of payment only for the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The claim was submitted fraudulently;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The health care services identified in the claim were not delivered by the health care provider;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The claim payment was for services covered by Title XVIII, Title XIX, or Title XXI of the Social Security Act;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The claim payment is the subject of an adjustment with a different insurer, administrator, or payor and such adjustment is not affected by a contractual relationship, association, or affiliation involving claims payment, processing, or pricing;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The claim payment is the subject of legal action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An insurer shall notify a health care provider at least 15 days in advance of the imposition of any retroactive denials of previously paid claims.  The health care provider shall have 6 months from the date of notification under this paragraph to determine whether the insured has other appropriate insurance, which was in effect on the date of service.  Notwithstanding the contractual terms between the insurer and provider, the insurer shall allow for the submission of a claim that was previously denied by another insurer due to the insured's transfer or termination of coverage.

There shall be no liability of any kind on the part of the state, the department, and its employees for the accuracy of such list or for any comments made with respect to it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any production agency or administrator licensed by the department which advertises, sells, transacts, or administers coverage in this state described in paragraph I which is provided by any person or entity described in paragraph III shall, if that coverage is not fully insured or otherwise fully covered by an admitted life or disability insurer, nonprofit hospital service plan, or nonprofit health care plan, advise in writing, any purchaser, prospective purchaser, and covered person of such lack of insurance or other coverage and shall advise, in writing, the attending lack of guaranty association protection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415:24 Rate Modifications for Accident and Health Insurance Policies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Rate modifications on individual accident and health policy forms shall be filed with the commissioner prior to implementation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At the time of filing new premium rates on any previously approved individual accident and health insurance policy form, other than forms for Medicare supplement policies and long-term care policies, the benefits provided by the policy form shall be deemed reasonable to the premium charge and the rates deemed approved, so long as the insurer complies with the terms of a loss ratio guarantee filed with the commissioner.  The loss ratio guarantee agreement shall be in writing and shall include at least the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A recitation of the anticipated annual and lifetime loss ratio standards included in the original actuarial memorandum filed with the policy form at the time of the initial approval of the policy form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A guarantee that the actual loss ratios in this state for the experience period in which the rates take effect, and for each experience period thereafter, will meet or exceed the anticipated annual loss ratio standards as recited in accordance with RSA 415:24, II(a).  If the annual earned premium volume in this state under a policy form is less than $1,000,000, the loss ratio guarantee shall be based on the actual nationwide loss ratio for the policy form.  If the annual earned premium volume nationwide is less than $1,000,000, the experience period shall be extended until the end of the calendar year in which $1,000,000 of earned premiums is attained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A guarantee that the actual loss ratio results for each calendar year the rates are in effect shall be independently audited during the second quarter of the following year at the expense of the insurer.  The audited results shall be reported to the commissioner no later than the date for filing the applicable accident and health policy experience exhibit.  The audit shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing or actuarial standards and shall be signed by a certified public accountant or a member of the American Academy of Actuaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A guarantee that affected policyholders in this state shall be issued a proportional refund of premiums paid in the amount necessary to bring the actual loss ratio up to the anticipated annual loss ratio standards as recited in accordance with RSA 415:24, II(a).  If national loss ratios are used, the total amount refunded in this state shall equal the dollar amount necessary to achieve the loss ratio standards, multiplied by the total premium earned in this state on the policy form and divided by the total premiums earned in all states on the policy form.  The refund shall be made to all policyholders insured under the applicable policy form as of the last day of the experience period at issue and whose individual refund would equal $5 or more.  The refund shall include interest at the then current accident and health reserve interest rate established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners calculated from the last day of the experience period at issue until the date of payment, which shall be during the third quarter of the following year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A guarantee that refunds of less than $5 shall be aggregated by the insurer and paid to the department of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A guarantee that no increase in premium rate obtained pursuant to this section will be implemented on any individual policy in this state until after the policyholder has received at least 30 days advance notice of the planned increase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) For the purposes of this section, "loss ratio'' means the ratio of incurred claims to earned premium by number of years of policy duration, for all combined durations.
