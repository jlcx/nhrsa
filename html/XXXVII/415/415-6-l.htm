Each insurer that issues or renews any individual policy, plan, or contract of accident or health insurance providing maternity benefits, shall also provide to certificate holders of such insurance, who are residents of this state, coverage consistent with the terms and conditions of the policy for services rendered by a midwife certified under RSA 326-D.  Such coverage shall be subject to each insurer's standards and mechanisms for credentialing and contracting pursuant to RSA 420-J:4 and RSA 420-J:8 respectively, where applicable, and contingent upon services being provided in a licensed health care facility or at home and within the scope of practice of a certified midwife.  Benefits provided shall not be subject to any greater co-payment, deductible, or coinsurance than any other similar benefits provided by the insurer.
