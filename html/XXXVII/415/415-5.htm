(1) The entire money and other considerations therefor are expressed therein;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The time at which the insurance takes effect and terminates is expressed therein;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3)(a) It purports to insure only one person, except that a policy may, at the election of the carrier, insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any 2 or more eligible members of that family, including husband, wife, dependent children, or any other person dependent on the policyholder.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to require:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Coverage for services provided to a dependent before the effective date of this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(2) The date upon which the employer under whose contract coverage is provided to a dependent ceases to provide coverage to the subscriber.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to permit a health insurance carrier to refuse an election for coverage by a dependent pursuant to subparagraph (c), based upon the dependent's prior disqualification pursuant to subparagraph (d)(1).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Notice regarding coverage for a dependent as provided pursuant to this subparagraph shall be provided to a subscriber:

If such coverage is continued in accordance with this subparagraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the coverage for dependent children under subparagraph (3) includes coverage for dependent children who are full-time students, as defined by the appropriate educational institution, beyond the age of 18, such dependent coverage shall include coverage for a dependent's medically necessary leave of absence from school for a period not to exceed 12 months or the date on which coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy, whichever comes first.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Each such form, including riders and endorsements, shall be identified by a form number in the lower left-hand corner of the first page thereof;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) It contains no provision purporting to make any portion of the charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws of the insurer a part of the policy unless such portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or classification of risks, or short-rate table filed with the commissioner;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
