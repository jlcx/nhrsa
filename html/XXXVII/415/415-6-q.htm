<codesect>
Each insurer that issues or renews any individual policy, plan, or contract of accident or health insurance that constitutes health coverage under RSA 420-G:2, IX, and that provides benefits for medically necessary ambulance services shall reimburse the ambulance service provider directly or by a check payable to the insured and the ambulance service provider subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, plan, or contract.  Nothing in this section shall preclude an insurer from negotiating with and subsequently entering into a contract with a non-participating ambulance provider that establishes rates of reimbursement for emergency medical services.
