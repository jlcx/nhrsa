(i) "Routine patient care cost'' means the cost of any medically necessary health care service that is incurred as a result of the treatment being provided to a member of a health plan.  Routine costs are those for which the health plan regularly reimburses its members, health care providers, or health care institutions subject to the terms and conditions of the member's policy and the provider's service agreement with the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A policy, plan, or contract subject to this section shall provide coverage for all medically necessary routine patient care costs incurred as a result of a treatment being provided in accordance with a clinical trial to the extent such costs would be covered for noninvestigational treatments if the treatment is being provided or the studies are being conducted in a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial for cancer or the treatment is being provided for any other life-threatening condition.  Coverage for phase I or phase II clinical trials shall be decided on a case by case basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The coverage required under paragraph II shall be required if:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Standard treatment has been or would be ineffective, does not exist, or there is no superior non-investigational treatment alternative;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The facility and personnel providing the treatment are capable of doing so by virtue of their experience, training, and volume of patients treated to maintain expertise;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The available clinical or preclinical data provide a reasonable expectation that the treatment will be at least as effective as the non-investigational alternative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A policy, plan, or contract subject to this section shall provide coverage for routine patient care costs incurred for drugs and devices provided to the member during the clinical trial, which are not the subject of the clinical trial, provided that those drugs or devices have been approved for sale by the FDA, whether or not the FDA has approved the drug or device for use in treating the member's particular condition.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate the provisions of RSA 415:6-g or RSA 420-J:7-b.  This coverage shall include coverage for reasonable and medically necessary services necessary to administer the drug or use the device under evaluation in the clinical trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The provisions of this section shall apply to group hospital and medical expense policies subject to RSA 415, health service corporations under RSA 420-A, health maintenance organizations under RSA 420-B, and managed care organizations under RSA 420-J.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For the purposes of this section, providers participating in clinical trials shall obtain a patient's informed consent for participation in the clinical trial in a manner that is consistent with current legal and ethical standards.  Such document shall be available to the health insurer upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Health plans providing coverage under this section and the providers participating in those same clinical trials shall develop a mutually agreed upon process to share appropriate aggregate clinical and financial data on the progress and outcome of clinical trials subject to this section.  Health plans and the providers participating in clinical trials shall establish reasonable requirements for communication with the member's primary care provider regarding the member's clinical data.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a policy, plan, or contract paid for under the federal Medicare program nor the state children's health insurance program.
