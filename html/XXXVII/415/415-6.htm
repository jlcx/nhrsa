Except as provided in paragraph III of this section each such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain the provisions specified in this paragraph in the words in which the same appear in this section;  provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, substitute for one or more of such provisions corresponding provisions of different wording approved by the commissioner which are in each instance not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  Such provisions shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) A provision as follows:  Entire Contract;  Changes:  This policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of insurance.  No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or attached hereto.  No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) A provision as follows:  Time Limit on Certain Defenses:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) After 2 years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such 2-year period.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such initial 2-year period, nor to limit the application of RSA 415:6, II(1)-(5) in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation or other insurance.)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer's option) under the caption Incontestable'':  After this policy has been in force for a period of 2 years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the application.) <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after 2 years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3) A provision as follows:  Grace Period:  A grace period of __________ (insert a number not less than 7'' for weekly premium policies, 10'' for monthly premium policies and 31'' for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the policy shall continue in force.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add at the end of the above provision,<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsubject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the cancellation provision hereof.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnless not less than 5 days prior to the premium due date the insurer has delivered to the insured or has mailed to his last address as shown by the records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted,).<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(4) A provision as follows:  Reinstatement:  If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy;  provided, however, that if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application.  The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained on or after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin on or after the date of reinstatement.  In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.  Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(4-a) With respect to policies subject to RSA 420-G, a provision as follows:  Reinstatement:  If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent payment of the premium to the insurer or to any agent duly authorized by the insurer to receive such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy;  provided, however, that if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon receipt of such application by the insurer or such agent.  The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained on or after the date of reinstatement and loss due to sickness as may begin on or after the date of reinstatement.  In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium.  Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(5) A provision as follows:  Notice of Claim:  Written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible.  Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at __________ (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at least 2 years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the first and second sentences of the above provision:  Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least 2 years, he shall, at least once in every 6 months after having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability, except in the event of legal incapacity.  The period of 6 months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.  Delay in the giving of such notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of 6 months preceding the date on which such notice is actually given.)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(6) A provision as follows:  Claim Forms:  The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss.  If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(7) A provision as follows:  Proofs of Loss:  Written proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within one year after the date of such loss in the case of a Medicare supplement insurance policy and within 90 days after the date of such loss in the case of any other accident and health insurance policy.  Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(8) A provision as follows:  Time of Payment of Claims:  Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such loss.  Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid ___ (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(9) A provision as follows:  Payment of Claims:  Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.  If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured.  Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to such estate.  All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $ ___ (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1000), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto.  Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSubject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services;  but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(10) A provision as follows:  Physical Examinations and Autopsy:  The insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(11) A provision as follows:  Legal Actions:  No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy.  No such action shall be brought after the expiration of 3 years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(12) A provision as follows:  Change of Beneficiary:  Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(The first clause of this provision, relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's option.)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(13) A provision as follows:  Loss of Time Benefits:  If loss of time benefits payable to the insured are reduced by reason of benefits payable to the insured under the federal Social Security Act, such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the first month that benefits are payable for a period of disability;  except that if benefits under the policy are provided on a specified dollar amount basis, then such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the effective date of the policy.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(14) Refund upon cancellation:  After the policy has been continued beyond its original term, the insured may cancel the policy at any time by written notice, delivered or mailed to the insurer or the insurer's representative.  Such cancellation shall become effective upon receipt by the insurer or the insurer's representative, or on such later date as may be specified in such notice by the insured.  If the insured cancels, the insurer shall promptly return any unearned portion of the premium paid, but in any event shall return the unearned portion of the premium within 30 days.  The earned premium shall be computed on a pro-rata basis.  Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of the cancellation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(15) A provision as follows:  Pre-certification:  In the event that a person is covered by more than one plan that requires pre-certification, the member shall obtain pre-certification from the primary plan.  Although the member shall not be required to obtain pre-certification from the secondary plan, the secondary plan shall not be required to treat such services as covered services if the services do not meet its certification criteria.  The secondary plan shall not refuse payment for such services solely on the basis that the services were not pre-certified by the secondary plan.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Other Provisions.  Except as provided in paragraph III of this section, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this section;  provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the commissioner which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) A provision as follows:  Change of Occupation:  If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation.  If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro-rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent.  In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued;  but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) A provision as follows:  Misstatement of Age:  If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3) A provision as follows:  Other Insurance in This Insurer:  If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for ___(insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $ ___ (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or to his estate.<br>or, in lieu thereof:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInsurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(4) A provision in all nongroup policies as follows:  Insurance with Other Insurers:  If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or an expense incurred basis, payment shall not be prorated or reduced.  If such a case, the insured shall be entitled to payment from both insurers.  Provided, however, that the provisions of this subparagraph shall not prohibit the issuance of a benefits deductible'' on policies determined by the insurance commissioner as major medical policies.  The term benefits deductible'', as used herein, means the value of any benefits provided on an expense incurred basis which are provided with respect to covered medical expenses by any other hospital, surgical or medical insurance policy or hospital or medical service subscriber contract or medical practice or other prepayment plan, or any other plan or program whether on an insured or uninsured basis.  Provided, however, that the term benefits deductible'' shall not mean the value of benefits provided with respect to medical or liability insurance offered under either a general liability insurance policy or an auto insurance policy.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(5) A provision in all non-group policies as follows:  Insurance with Other Insurers:  If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis, payment shall not be prorated or reduced.  In such a case, the insured shall be entitled to payment from both insurers.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(6) A provision as follows:  Relation of Earnings to Insurance:  If the total monthly amount of loss time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of 2 years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such 2 years as shall exceed the pro-rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder;  but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.  The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of valid loss of time coverage,'' approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner or any combination of such coverages.  In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(7) A provision as follows:  Unpaid Premium:  Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(8) A provision as follows:  Cancellation;  Refusal to Renew:  The insurer may refuse to renew on the policy anniversary date, or may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to the insured's last address as shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than 30 days thereafter, such cancellation or refusal to renew shall be effective.  If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro-rata.  Cancellation or refusal to renew shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of the cancellation or refusal to renew.  However, such cancellation or refusal to renew, if for reasons other than nonpayment of premium and other than specified in any time limits for certain defenses, shall be effected only if also effected on all policyholders of the same class.  No such action shall be taken without prior written approval of the insurance commissioner.  The insurer shall have the burden of proof that the classification of risk involved therein is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, pursuant to RSA 415:15.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(9) A provision as follows:  Conformity with State Statutes:  Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such statutes.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Inapplicable or Inconsistent Provisions.  If any provision of this section is in whole or in part inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy, the insurer, with the approval of the commissioner, shall omit from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage provided by the policy.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. Order of Certain Policy Provisions.  The provisions which are the subject of paragraphs I and II of this section, or any corresponding provisions which are used in lieu thereof in accordance with such paragraphs shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such paragraphs or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered or issued.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. Third Party Ownership.  The word insured,'' as used in this chapter, shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits and rights provided therein.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. Requirements of Other Jurisdictions.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) Any policy of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state, may contain any provision which is not less favorable to the insured or the beneficiary than the provisions of this chapter and which is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is organized.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) Any policy of a domestic insurer may, when issued for delivery in any other state or country, contain any provision permitted or required by the laws of such other state or country.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. Filing Procedure.  The commissioner may make such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to this chapter as are necessary, proper or advisable to the administration of this chapter.  This provision shall not abridge any other authority granted the commissioner by law.">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Required Provisions.  Except as provided in paragraph III of this section each such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain the provisions specified in this paragraph in the words in which the same appear in this section;  provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, substitute for one or more of such provisions corresponding provisions of different wording approved by the commissioner which are in each instance not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  Such provisions shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A provision as follows:  Entire Contract;  Changes:  This policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of insurance.  No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or attached hereto.  No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A provision as follows:  Time Limit on Certain Defenses:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) After 2 years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such 2-year period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such initial 2-year period, nor to limit the application of RSA 415:6, II(1)-(5) in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation or other insurance.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer's option) under the caption "Incontestable'':  After this policy has been in force for a period of 2 years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the application.) 
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after 2 years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A provision as follows:  Grace Period:  A grace period of __________ (insert a number not less than "7'' for weekly premium policies, "10'' for monthly premium policies and "31'' for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the policy shall continue in force.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add at the end of the above provision,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the cancellation provision hereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Unless not less than 5 days prior to the premium due date the insurer has delivered to the insured or has mailed to his last address as shown by the records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted,).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A provision as follows:  Reinstatement:  If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy;  provided, however, that if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application.  The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained on or after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin on or after the date of reinstatement.  In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.  Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.)

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4-a) With respect to policies subject to RSA 420-G, a provision as follows:  Reinstatement:  If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent payment of the premium to the insurer or to any agent duly authorized by the insurer to receive such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy;  provided, however, that if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon receipt of such application by the insurer or such agent.  The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained on or after the date of reinstatement and loss due to sickness as may begin on or after the date of reinstatement.  In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium.  Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A provision as follows:  Notice of Claim:  Written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible.  Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at __________ (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at least 2 years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the first and second sentences of the above provision:  Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least 2 years, he shall, at least once in every 6 months after having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability, except in the event of legal incapacity.  The period of 6 months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.  Delay in the giving of such notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of 6 months preceding the date on which such notice is actually given.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A provision as follows:  Claim Forms:  The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss.  If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) A provision as follows:  Proofs of Loss:  Written proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within one year after the date of such loss in the case of a Medicare supplement insurance policy and within 90 days after the date of such loss in the case of any other accident and health insurance policy.  Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A provision as follows:  Time of Payment of Claims:  Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such loss.  Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid ___ (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) A provision as follows:  Payment of Claims:  Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.  If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured.  Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to such estate.  All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $ ___ (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1000), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto.  Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services;  but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) A provision as follows:  Physical Examinations and Autopsy:  The insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(11) A provision as follows:  Legal Actions:  No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy.  No such action shall be brought after the expiration of 3 years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(12) A provision as follows:  Change of Beneficiary:  Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The first clause of this provision, relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's option.)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(13) A provision as follows:  Loss of Time Benefits:  If loss of time benefits payable to the insured are reduced by reason of benefits payable to the insured under the federal Social Security Act, such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the first month that benefits are payable for a period of disability;  except that if benefits under the policy are provided on a specified dollar amount basis, then such benefits shall not be further reduced by reason of any increase in benefits payable under the federal Social Security Act which takes effect after the effective date of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(14) Refund upon cancellation:  After the policy has been continued beyond its original term, the insured may cancel the policy at any time by written notice, delivered or mailed to the insurer or the insurer's representative.  Such cancellation shall become effective upon receipt by the insurer or the insurer's representative, or on such later date as may be specified in such notice by the insured.  If the insured cancels, the insurer shall promptly return any unearned portion of the premium paid, but in any event shall return the unearned portion of the premium within 30 days.  The earned premium shall be computed on a pro-rata basis.  Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of the cancellation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(15) A provision as follows:  Pre-certification:  In the event that a person is covered by more than one plan that requires pre-certification, the member shall obtain pre-certification from the primary plan.  Although the member shall not be required to obtain pre-certification from the secondary plan, the secondary plan shall not be required to treat such services as covered services if the services do not meet its certification criteria.  The secondary plan shall not refuse payment for such services solely on the basis that the services were not pre-certified by the secondary plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Other Provisions.  Except as provided in paragraph III of this section, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this section;  provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the commissioner which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A provision as follows:  Change of Occupation:  If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation.  If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro-rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent.  In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued;  but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A provision as follows:  Misstatement of Age:  If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A provision as follows:  Other Insurance in This Insurer:  If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for ___(insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $ ___ (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or to his estate.
<br>
or, in lieu thereof:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A provision in all nongroup policies as follows:  Insurance with Other Insurers:  If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or an expense incurred basis, payment shall not be prorated or reduced.  If such a case, the insured shall be entitled to payment from both insurers.  Provided, however, that the provisions of this subparagraph shall not prohibit the issuance of a "benefits deductible'' on policies determined by the insurance commissioner as major medical policies.  The term "benefits deductible'', as used herein, means the value of any benefits provided on an expense incurred basis which are provided with respect to covered medical expenses by any other hospital, surgical or medical insurance policy or hospital or medical service subscriber contract or medical practice or other prepayment plan, or any other plan or program whether on an insured or uninsured basis.  Provided, however, that the term "benefits deductible'' shall not mean the value of benefits provided with respect to medical or liability insurance offered under either a general liability insurance policy or an auto insurance policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A provision in all non-group policies as follows:  Insurance with Other Insurers:  If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis, payment shall not be prorated or reduced.  In such a case, the insured shall be entitled to payment from both insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A provision as follows:  Relation of Earnings to Insurance:  If the total monthly amount of loss time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of 2 years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such 2 years as shall exceed the pro-rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder;  but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue.  The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "valid loss of time coverage,'' approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner or any combination of such coverages.  In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) A provision as follows:  Unpaid Premium:  Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A provision as follows:  Cancellation;  Refusal to Renew:  The insurer may refuse to renew on the policy anniversary date, or may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to the insured's last address as shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than 30 days thereafter, such cancellation or refusal to renew shall be effective.  If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro-rata.  Cancellation or refusal to renew shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of the cancellation or refusal to renew.  However, such cancellation or refusal to renew, if for reasons other than nonpayment of premium and other than specified in any time limits for certain defenses, shall be effected only if also effected on all policyholders of the same class.  No such action shall be taken without prior written approval of the insurance commissioner.  The insurer shall have the burden of proof that the classification of risk involved therein is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, pursuant to RSA 415:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) A provision as follows:  Conformity with State Statutes:  Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such statutes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Inapplicable or Inconsistent Provisions.  If any provision of this section is in whole or in part inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy, the insurer, with the approval of the commissioner, shall omit from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage provided by the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Order of Certain Policy Provisions.  The provisions which are the subject of paragraphs I and II of this section, or any corresponding provisions which are used in lieu thereof in accordance with such paragraphs shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such paragraphs or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered or issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Third Party Ownership.  The word "insured,'' as used in this chapter, shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits and rights provided therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Requirements of Other Jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any policy of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state, may contain any provision which is not less favorable to the insured or the beneficiary than the provisions of this chapter and which is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is organized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any policy of a domestic insurer may, when issued for delivery in any other state or country, contain any provision permitted or required by the laws of such other state or country.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Filing Procedure.  The commissioner may make such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to this chapter as are necessary, proper or advisable to the administration of this chapter.  This provision shall not abridge any other authority granted the commissioner by law.
