I. Each insurer that issues or renews any 2014 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009, Public Law 111-148--compliant small group policy of group or blanket accident or health insurance that constitutes health coverage for the services of chiropractors licensed under RSA 316-A, or physical therapists licensed under RSA 328-A, shall offer an optional plan which shall not charge a copayment, coinsurance, or office visit deductible that is greater than the copayment, coinsurance, or office visit deductible amount charged to the insured for the services of a primary care physician licensed under RSA 329.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall compile available data and prepare reports concerning member cost sharing and the impact on utilization of services for physical therapy and chiropractic care.  The first report shall be due by December 1, 2014, and shall analyze all New Hampshire insurance markets and identify differences in cost sharing and utilization of health services for the purpose of determining if there is a statistical association between the use of physical therapy and chiropractic care services and copayment amounts.  The commissioner shall also seek to determine whether the overall costs of patients that utilize chiropractic care or physical therapists are less when the patient has lower copayment amounts for these services, and if any observed lower overall patient costs are caused by reductions in other health care services and better health care outcomes, not patient health status.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A second report shall be due October 1, 2017, with requirements to provide the same information, but using the most current data available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The insurance department shall consult with providers in preparing the scope of this study and gathering research for the study.  Data shall include, but not be limited to, the costs for all physician services, medication, imaging, hospitalization, and procedures, such as spinal injections.  For purposes of ensuring a more complete comparison, the top 50 ICD codes for diagnosis treated by physical therapists and chiropractors shall be analyzed and a comparison of the total cost of low copay plans and high copay plans shall be conducted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner shall make the reports, together with any recommendations for legislation, to the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, the governor, and the chairs of the house and senate commerce committees.
