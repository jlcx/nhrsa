&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The debtors eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all the debtors of the creditor or creditors whose indebtedness is repayable in installments, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to the indebtedness or to the purchase giving rise to the indebtedness.  The policy may provide that the term "debtors'' shall include the debtors of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the debtors of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors, or partnerships if the business of the policyholder and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors, or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership, contract, or otherwise.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The insurance shall be payable to the policyholder.  Such payment shall reduce or extinguish the unpaid indebtedness of the debtor to the extent of such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
