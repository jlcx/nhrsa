&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
An insurer placed under administrative supervision by the commissioner may contest any action taken pursuant to the agreed supervision order at any time during the supervision by requesting review by the superior court for Merrimack county.  The court shall review the action complained of in a closed hearing and render its decision at the earliest possible date thereafter.  The court may stay any action of the commissioner, pending its review of such petition.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, filing of a petition for review of such action shall not automatically stay the commissioner's action, or any of the provisions of the supervision order.
