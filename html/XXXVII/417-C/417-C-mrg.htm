&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417-C:1 Grounds for Cancellation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A notice of cancellation of a policy, to which RSA 417-C:2 applies, shall be effective only if it is based on one or more of the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Nonpayment of a premium, including nonpayment of any additional premiums due from an audit conducted in accordance with law for the prior policy term;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fraud or material misrepresentation affecting the policy or in the presentation of a claim thereunder, or violation of any of the terms or conditions of the policy;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Substantial increase in hazard;  provided that cancellation for this reason shall be effective only after prior approval of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This section shall not apply to any policy or coverage which has been in effect less than 60 days at the time notice of cancellation is mailed or delivered by the insurer unless it is a renewal policy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417-C:2 Notice of Cancellation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No notice of cancellation shall be effective unless mailed or physically (not electronically) delivered by the insurer to the named insureds at least 60 days prior to the effective date of cancellation;  provided, however, that where cancellation is for nonpayment of premium or substantial increase in hazard, at least 10 days' notice of cancellation shall be given.  In all instances, the reason or reasons for cancellation shall accompany or be included in the notice of cancellation.  An insurer shall not be held liable in any claim or suit for damages arising solely from the insurer's compliance with the requirement that the reason for cancellation be specified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notice of cancellation under this section shall be by certified mail, except that in the case of cancellation for nonpayment of premium, notice shall be by certified mail or certificate of mailing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall have the authority to waive any provision of paragraph I upon the written request of an insurer specifying the reasons therefor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h3>Section 417-C:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417-C:3 Notice of Nonrenewal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No insurer shall increase renewal premiums more than 25 percent for a 12-month renewal term or refuse to renew a policy at its expiration or anniversary if written for a term of more than one year unless such insurer or its agent shall mail or physically (not electronically) deliver to the named insureds at the address shown in the policy, advance notice of the proposed renewal premium or its intention not to renew.  The notice shall be at least 60 days in advance of the policy's scheduled expiration or anniversary date.  This section shall not apply if the insurer has manifested its willingness to renew with a premium increase of no more than 25 percent, or in case of nonpayment of premium, or if the insured fails to pay any advance premium required by the insurer for renewal.  However, notwithstanding the failure of an insurer to comply with this section, any coverage shall terminate on the effective date of any other coverage acquired by the insured to the extent the acquired coverage substantially duplicates coverages of the renewal.  Renewal of a policy shall not constitute a waiver or estoppel with respect to grounds for cancellation which existed before the effective date of such renewal.

<center><h3>Section 417-C:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417-C:4 Renewals;  Premiums. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any renewal premium increase in excess of 25 percent is considered a nonrenewal and controlled by the provisions of RSA 417-C:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any renewal premium increase of 25 percent or less shall not be implemented until the insured has had a minimum of 30 days' notice of the renewal premium.  If all or any part of the 30 day notice is not in advance of the expiration or anniversary date, renewal coverage shall be provided, on a pro rata basis, at the rates or premiums in effect under the expiring policy until the 30 days' notice requirement has been fulfilled.  This paragraph shall not apply if the insured accepts the renewal policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Development of renewal premium for the purpose of determining the percentage of change from expiring premium shall be based on the same coverages, conditions, and ratable exposures as those contained in the expiring policy.
