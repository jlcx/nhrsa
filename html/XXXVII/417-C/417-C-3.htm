<center><h3>Section 417-C:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417-C:3 Notice of Nonrenewal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No insurer shall increase renewal premiums more than 25 percent for a 12-month renewal term or refuse to renew a policy at its expiration or anniversary if written for a term of more than one year unless such insurer or its agent shall mail or physically (not electronically) deliver to the named insureds at the address shown in the policy, advance notice of the proposed renewal premium or its intention not to renew.  The notice shall be at least 60 days in advance of the policy's scheduled expiration or anniversary date.  This section shall not apply if the insurer has manifested its willingness to renew with a premium increase of no more than 25 percent, or in case of nonpayment of premium, or if the insured fails to pay any advance premium required by the insurer for renewal.  However, notwithstanding the failure of an insurer to comply with this section, any coverage shall terminate on the effective date of any other coverage acquired by the insured to the extent the acquired coverage substantially duplicates coverages of the renewal.  Renewal of a policy shall not constitute a waiver or estoppel with respect to grounds for cancellation which existed before the effective date of such renewal.
