&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Invest, in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of 10 percent of such insurer's assets or 50 percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after such investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.  In calculating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, and there shall be included:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of such subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities;  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) With the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries, provided that after such investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Qualification of Investment;  When Determined.  Whether any investment pursuant to paragraph II meets the applicable requirements thereof is to be determined before such investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the current value of all previous investments in equity securities, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Cessation of Control.  If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment in such subsidiary made pursuant to this section within 3 years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after such investment shall have been made, such investment shall have met the requirements for investment under any other section of this chapter, and the insurer has notified the commissioner of the requirement fulfillment.
