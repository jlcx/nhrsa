&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Judicial Review, Mandamus.  Any person aggrieved by any act, determination, rule, regulation, or order of any other action of the commissioner pursuant to this chapter may appeal in accordance with RSA 541.  The court shall conduct its review without a jury and by trial de novo, except that if all parties, including the commissioner, so stipulate, the review shall be confined to the record.  Portions of the record may be introduced by stipulation into evidence in a trial de novo as to those parties so stipulating.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The filing of an appeal pursuant to this section shall stay the application of any rule, regulation, order, or other action by the commissioner to the appealing party unless the court, after giving the party notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that a stay would be detrimental to the interest of policyholders, shareholders, creditors or the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person aggrieved by any failure of the commissioner to act or make a determination required by this chapter may petition the Merrimack county superior court for a writ of mandamus or a peremptory mandamus directing the commissioner to act or make a determination.
