<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Approval by Commissioner;  Hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in RSA 401-B:3, I unless, after a public hearing thereon, he finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After the change of control the domestic insurer referred to in RSA 401-B:3, I would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders or the interests of any remaining security holders who are unaffiliated with such acquiring party;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The competence, experience and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The public hearing referred to in RSA 401-B:3, VI(a) shall be held within 60 days after the statement required by RSA 401-B:3, I is filed and at least 20 days' notice thereof shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement.  Not less than 10 days' notice of such public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to such other persons as may be designated by the commissioner.  The insurer shall give such notice to its security holders.  The commissioner shall make a determination within 30 days after the conclusion of such hearing.  At such hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interests may be affected thereby shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection therewith shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the superior court of this state.  All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than 3 days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Mailings to Shareholders;  Payment of Expenses.  All statements, amendments, or other material filed pursuant to RSA 401-B:3, I, II and III, and all notices of public hearings held pursuant to RSA 401-B:3, VI, shall be mailed by the insurer to its shareholders within 5 business days after the insurer has received such statements, amendments, other material, or notices.  The expenses of mailing shall be borne by the person making the filing.  As security for the payment of such expenses, such person shall file with the commissioner an acceptable bond or other deposit in an amount to be determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Exemptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt therefrom as
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) As otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any acquisition of any voting security of a domestic insurer by spouses, issue, heirs, or next of kin of the owner acquiring the same by gift, will, appointment, or intestate succession.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Violations.  The following shall be violations of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to RSA 401-B:3, I, or II, or III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given his approval thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Jurisdiction;  Consent to Service of Process.  The courts of this state are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and over all actions involving such person arising out of violations of this section, and each such person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by such a person of the commissioner to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of violations of this section.  Copies of all such lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to such person at his last known address.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Violations of Acquiring Parties.  Any acquiring party which violates any provision of this section shall be subject to an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500 for each violation.
