<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Approval by Commissioner;  Hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in paragraph I unless, after a public hearing, the commissioner finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After the change of control the domestic insurer referred to in paragraph I would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly.  In applying the competitive standard in this subparagraph:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The informational requirements of RSA 401-B:3-a, III(a) and the standards of RSA 401-B:3-a, IV(b) shall apply;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the commissioner finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by RSA 401-B:3-a, IV(c) exist;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The public hearing referred to in subparagraph VI(a) shall be held within 30 days after the statement required by paragraph I is filed and at least 20 days' notice shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement.  Not less than 7 days' notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to such other persons as may be designated by the commissioner.  The insurer shall give such notice to its security holders.  The commissioner shall make a determination within the 60-day period preceding the effective date of the proposed transaction.  At such hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection therewith shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the superior court of this state.  All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than 3 days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in subparagraph (b) may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in paragraph I.  Such person shall file the statement referred to in paragraph I with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) within 5 days of making the request for a public hearing.  A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within 10 days of the receipt of the statement referred to in paragraph I.  A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled.  Such commissioners shall hear and receive evidence.  A commissioner may attend such hearing, in person or by telecommunication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the commissioner that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and regulations of this state shall be made not later than 60 days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to subparagraph I(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Exemptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt as not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer, or as otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Violations.  The following shall be violations of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to paragraph I or II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Jurisdiction;  Consent to Service of Process.  The courts of this state are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and over all actions involving such person arising out of violations of this section, and each the person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by the person of the commissioner to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of violations of this section.  Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to the person at his last known address.
