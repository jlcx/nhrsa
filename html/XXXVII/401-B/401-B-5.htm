<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The books, accounts, and records of each party to all such transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the nature and details of the transactions, including such accounting information as is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section, which are subject to any materiality standards contained in RSA 401-B:5, I-VII, may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into the transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or such shorter period as the commissioner may permit, and the commissioner has not disapproved it within such period.  The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer.  Informal notice shall be reported, within 30 days after a termination of a previously filed agreement, to the commissioner for determination of the type of filing required, if any.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, extensions of credit, or investments, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3 percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders;  as of December 31, next preceding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3 percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31, next preceding;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) All reinsurance pooling agreements;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, or projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next 3 years, equals or exceeds 5 percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of the December 31, next preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a non-affiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and non-affiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees, and all cost-sharing arrangements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Guarantees when made by a domestic insurer;  provided, however, that a guarantee which is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirements of this paragraph unless it exceeds the lesser of  1/2 of one percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 10 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31, next preceding.  Further, all guarantees which are not quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that controls the insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount which, together with its present holdings in such investments, exceeds 2- 1/2 percent of the insurer's surplus to policyholders.  Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in subsidiaries acquired pursuant to RSA 401-B:2 or authorized under any other section of this chapter, or in non-subsidiary insurance affiliates that are subject to the provisions of this chapter, are exempt from this requirement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Any material transactions, specified by rule, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise.  If the commissioner determines that separate transactions were entered into over any 12-month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise his or her authority under RSA 401-B:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subparagraph I(b), shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards of subparagraph I(a) and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The commissioner shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10 percent of the corporation's voting securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Dividends and Other Distributions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Until the commissioner has approved the payment within the 30-day period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) For the purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Ten percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the December 31, next preceding;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending December 31, next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous 2 calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends.  This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the commissioner's approval, and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The commissioner has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commissioner has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period referred to above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Management of Domestic Insurers Subject to Registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identify consistent with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subparagraph I(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Not less than  1/3 of the directors of a domestic insurer, and not less than  1/3 of the member of each committee of the board of directors of any domestic insurer shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or entity.  At least one such person shall be included in any quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors or any committee thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish one or more committees comprised solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity.  The committee or committees shall have responsibility for nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The provisions of subparagraphs (c) and (d) shall not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer, such as an insurer, a mutual insurance holding company, or a public held corporation, has a board of directors and committees thereof that meet the requirements of subparagraphs (c) and (d) with respect to such controlling entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) An insurer may make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this paragraph, if the insurer's annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and Federal Flood Program, is less than $300,000,000.  An insurer may also make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this paragraph based upon unique circumstances.  The commissioner may consider various factors including, but not limited to, the type of business entity, volume of business written, availability of qualified board members, or the ownership or organizational structure of the entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Adequacy of Surplus.  For purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writing, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among several lines of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The number and size of risks insured in each line of business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The adequacy of the insurer's reserves.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The quality and liquidity of investment in affiliates.  The commissioner may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner the investment so warrants.
