&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:1 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the respective meanings hereinafter set forth, unless the context shall otherwise require:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An "affiliate'' of, or person "affiliated'' with, a specific person, is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The term "commissioner'' shall mean the insurance commissioner, his deputies, or the insurance department, as appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The term "control'' (including the terms "controlling'', "controlled by'' and "under common control with'') means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract other than a commercial contract for goods or non-management services, or otherwise, unless the power is the result of an official position with or corporate office held by the person.  Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the voting securities of any other person.  This presumption may be rebutted by a showing made in the manner provided by RSA 401-B:4, IX that control does not exist in fact.  The commissioner may determine, after furnishing all persons in interest notice and opportunity to be heard and making specific findings of fact to support such determination, that control exists in fact, notwithstanding the absence of a presumption to that effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An "insurance holding company system'' consists of 2 or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(a) Agencies, authorities or instrumentalities of the United States, its possessions and territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, or a state or political subdivision of a state,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fraternal benefit societies, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nonprofit medical and hospital service associations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A "person'' is an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization, any similar entity or any combination of the foregoing acting in concert, but shall not include any securities broker performing no more than the usual and customary broker's function.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A "security holder'' of a specified person is one who owns any security of such person, including common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and any other security convertible into or evidencing the right to acquire any of the foregoing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A "subsidiary'' of a specified person is an affiliate controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The term "voting security'' shall include any security convertible into or evidencing a right to acquire a voting security.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Approval by Commissioner;  Hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in RSA 401-B:3, I unless, after a public hearing thereon, he finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After the change of control the domestic insurer referred to in RSA 401-B:3, I would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders or the interests of any remaining security holders who are unaffiliated with such acquiring party;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The competence, experience and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The public hearing referred to in RSA 401-B:3, VI(a) shall be held within 60 days after the statement required by RSA 401-B:3, I is filed and at least 20 days' notice thereof shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement.  Not less than 10 days' notice of such public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to such other persons as may be designated by the commissioner.  The insurer shall give such notice to its security holders.  The commissioner shall make a determination within 30 days after the conclusion of such hearing.  At such hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interests may be affected thereby shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection therewith shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the superior court of this state.  All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than 3 days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Mailings to Shareholders;  Payment of Expenses.  All statements, amendments, or other material filed pursuant to RSA 401-B:3, I, II and III, and all notices of public hearings held pursuant to RSA 401-B:3, VI, shall be mailed by the insurer to its shareholders within 5 business days after the insurer has received such statements, amendments, other material, or notices.  The expenses of mailing shall be borne by the person making the filing.  As security for the payment of such expenses, such person shall file with the commissioner an acceptable bond or other deposit in an amount to be determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Exemptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt therefrom as
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) As otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given his approval thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Jurisdiction;  Consent to Service of Process.  The courts of this state are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and over all actions involving such person arising out of violations of this section, and each such person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by such a person of the commissioner to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of violations of this section.  Copies of all such lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to such person at his last known address.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:3-a Acquisitions Involving Insurers Not Otherwise Covered. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Definitions.  The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this section only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Acquisition'' means any agreement, arrangement or activity, the consummation of which results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, and includes but is not limited to the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An "involved insurer'' includes an insurer which either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Scope.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Except as exempted in subparagraph II(b), this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This section shall not apply to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An acquisition subject to approval or disapproval by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 401-B:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes, so long as such securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state.  If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under RSA 401-B:1, III, it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and such disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if pre-acquisition notification is filed with the commissioner in accordance with subparagraph III(a) 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition.  However, such pre-acquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The acquisition of already affiliated persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed 5 percent of the total market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) There would be no increase in any market share.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed 12 percent of the total market and the market share would not increase by more than 2 percent of the total market.  For the purpose of subparagraph II(b)(5), a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) An acquisition for which a pre-acquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds that such insurer is in failing condition;  there is a lack of feasible alternatives to improving such condition;  the public benefits of improving such insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition;  and such findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Pre-Acquisition Notification, Waiting Period.  An acquisition covered by paragraph II may be subject to an order pursuant to paragraph V, unless the acquiring person files a pre-acquisition notification and the waiting period has expired.  The acquired person may file a pre-acquisition notification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The pre-acquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those markets which, under subparagraph II(b)(5), cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section.  The commissioner may require such additional material and information as he deems necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of paragraph IV.  The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his ability to render an informed opinion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the commissioner of a pre-acquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of such receipt, or termination of the waiting period, by the commissioner.  Prior to the end of the waiting period, the commissioner on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of such additional information by the commissioner or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Competitive Standard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner may enter an order under subparagraph V(a) with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly in that line of insurance or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of subparagraph IV(a) the commissioner shall consider the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any acquisition covered under paragraph II involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards where:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:
<PRE>
Insurer A Insurer B 
4 percent 4 percent or more 
10 percent 2 percent or more 
15 percent 1 percent or more 
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Or, the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:
<PRE>
Insurer A Insurer B 
5 percent 5 percent or more 
10 percent 4 percent or more 
15 percent 3 percent or more 
19 percent 1 percent or more 
</PRE>
<br>
A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the 4 largest insurers is 75 percent or more of the market.  Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown.  If more than 2 insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the 2 columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subparagraph IV(a).  For the purpose of this subparagraph, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be insurer A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the 2 largest to the 8 largest, has increased by 7 percent or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year 5 to 10 years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition.  Any acquisition or merger covered under paragraph II involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subparagraph IV(a) if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of such large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Another involved insurer's market is 2 percent or more.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) For the purposes of subparagraph IV(b):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The term "insurer'' includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership or control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The term "market'' means the relevant product and geographical markets.  In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition.  In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs IV(b)(1) and (2), the commissioner may establish the requisite anti-competitive effect based upon other substantial evidence.  Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs IV(b)(1) and (2), a party may establish the absence of the requisite anti-competitive effect based upon other substantial evidence.  Relevant factors in making a determination under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the following:  market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An order may not be entered under subparagraph V(a) if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of such increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Orders and Penalties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) (1) If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the commissioner may enter an order:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Such an order shall not be entered unless there is a hearing, notice of such hearing to be issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than 15 days prior to the hearing, and the hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than 60 days after the end of the waiting period.  Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the commissioner setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) An order entered under subparagraph V(a) shall not become final earlier than 30 days after it is issued, during which time the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anti-competitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time.  Based upon such plan or other information, the commissioner shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the standards of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) An order pursuant to subparagraph V(a) shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner under subparagraph V(a) shall be subject to suspension or revocation of license, to an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500 for each day of violation, or both, in the discretion of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any such filing requirement, shall be subject to an administrative fine not to exceed $10,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Inapplicable Provisions.  RSA 401-B:9, II and III and RSA 401-B:11 do not apply to acquisitions covered under paragraph II.

The commissioner may require any authorized insurer which is a member of a holding company system which is not subject to registration under this section to furnish a copy of the registration statement or other information filed by such insurance company with the insurance regulatory authority of domiciliary jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Amendments to Registration Statements.  Each registered insurer shall keep current information required to be disclosed in its registration statement by reporting all material changes or additions on amendment forms provided by the commissioner within 15 days after the end of the month in which it learns of each such change or addition, provided, however, that subject to RSA 401-B:5, III, each registered insurer shall so report all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within 2 business days following the declaration thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Termination of Registration.  The commissioner shall terminate the registration of any insurer which demonstrates that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.

After a disclaimer has been filed, the insurer shall be relieved of any duty to register or report under this section which may arise out of the insurer's relationship with such person unless and until the commissioner disallows such a disclaimer.  The commissioner shall disallow such a disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest with notice and opportunity to be heard and after making specific findings of fact to support such disallowance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Violations.  The failure to file a registration statement or any amendment thereto required by this section within the time specified for such filing shall be a violation of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Outlining Changes.  All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items in the current registration statement representing changes from the prior registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The books, accounts and records of each party to all such transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the nature and details of the transactions, including such accounting information as is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its holding company system may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior to entering into the transaction, or such shorter period as the commissioner may permit, and the commissioner has not disapproved it within such period:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees, or investments, provided such transactions are equal to or exceed with respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3 percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders;  or with respect to life insurers, 3 percent of the insurer's admitted assets;  each as of December 31, next preceding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided such transactions are equal to or exceed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) with respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3 percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) with respect to life insurers, 3 percent of the insurer's admitted assets, each as of the 31st day of December, next preceding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities equals or exceeds 5 percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of the December 31, next preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a non-affiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and non-affiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) All management agreements, service contracts and all cost-sharing arrangements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Any material transactions, specified by rule, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subparagraph I(b), shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards of subparagraph I(a) and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10 percent of such corporation's voting securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Dividends and Other Distributions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such payment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commissioner shall have approved such payment within such 30-day period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the purposes of this paragraph, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds 10 percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the December 31, next preceding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the commissioner's approval, and such a declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The commissioner has approved the payment of such dividend or distribution;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commissioner has not disapproved such payment within the 30-day period referred to above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. All Other Dividends and Distributions.  No domestic insurer shall pay any dividend or make any distribution to its shareholders unless the insurer has notified the commissioner of such payment 15 days prior to the payment date.  Such notice shall be kept confidential by the commissioner until the payment date of the dividend.  The commissioner may order that a dividend not be paid if the commissioner finds that the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following the payment to shareholders would be inadequate or could lead the insurer to a hazardous financial condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Adequacy of Surplus.  For purposes of this chapter in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writing, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among several lines of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The number and size of risks insured in each line of business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The adequacy of the insurer's reserves.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The quality and liquidity of investment in affiliates.  The commissioner may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in his judgment such investment so warrants.

No security which is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or which is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner hereunder may be voted at any shareholders' meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though such securities were not issued and outstanding;  but no action taken at any such meeting shall be invalidated by the voting of such securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state have so ordered.  If an insurer or the commissioner has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner hereunder the insurer or the commissioner may apply to the superior court for Merrimack county or to the superior court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business to enjoin any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition made in contravention of RSA 401-B:5 or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the commissioner thereunder to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of such security already cast at any meeting of shareholders, and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interests of the insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Sequestration of Voting Securities.  In any case where a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of this chapter or any rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner hereunder, the superior court for Merrimack county or the superior court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business may, on such notice as the court deems appropriate, upon the application of the insurer or the commissioner seize or sequester any voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by such person, and issue such orders with respect thereto as may be appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this chapter.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this chapter, the situs of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers shall be deemed to be in this state.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:13 Plans for Acquisition of Minority Interests in Domestic Stock Insurance Companies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any parent corporation directly or indirectly owning at least 95 percent of the aggregate issued and outstanding shares of all classes of voting stock of a domestic stock insurance company may, pursuant to a plan for acquisition of minority interests in such subsidiary, acquire all of its remaining issued and outstanding shares of voting stock, by exchange of stock, other securities, cash, other consideration or any combination thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of directors, trustees, or other governing body of the parent corporation may adopt a plan for the acquisition of minority interests in a subsidiary insurer.  Every plan shall set forth:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name of the company whose shares are to be acquired;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The total number of issued and outstanding shares of each class of voting stock of the company, the number of its shares owned by the parent corporation and, if either of the foregoing is subject to change prior to the effective date of acquisition, the manner in which any change may occur;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The terms and conditions of the plan, including the manner and basis of exchanging the shares to be acquired for shares or other securities of the parent corporation, for cash, other consideration, or any combination of the foregoing, the proposed effective date of acquisition and a statement clearly describing the rights of dissenting stockholders to demand appraisal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the parent corporation is neither a domestic corporation nor an authorized insurer, its agreement to be bound by paragraph VI of this section and RSA 293-A:13.01 through RSA 293-A:13.31 with respect to the plan, its consent to the enforcement against it in this state of the rights of stockholders pursuant to the plan, and a designation of the insurance commissioner as the agent upon whom process may be served against the parent corporation in the manner set forth in RSA 405:10 in any action or proceeding to enforce any such rights;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Such other provisions with respect to the plan as the board of directors, trustees or other governing body deems necessary or desirable, or which the insurance commissioner may prescribe.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon adoption of the plan, it shall be duly executed by the president and attested by the secretary, or the executive officers corresponding thereto, under the corporate seal of the parent corporation.  Thereupon, a certified copy of the plan, together with a certificate of its adoption subscribed by such officers and affirmed by them as true under the penalties of perjury and under the seal of the parent corporation, shall be submitted to the insurance commissioner for his approval.  The insurance commissioner shall thereupon consider the plan and, if satisfied that it complies with this section, is fair and equitable and not inconsistent with law, he shall approve the plan.  If the insurance commissioner disapproves the plan, notification of his disapproval, assigning the reasons therefor, shall be given in writing by him to the parent corporation.  No plan shall take effect unless the approval of the insurance commissioner has been obtained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the insurance commissioner approves the plan, the parent corporation shall deliver to each person who, as of the date of delivery, is a holder of record of stock to be acquired pursuant to the plan, a copy of the plan, or a summary thereof approved by the insurance commissioner in person or by depositing the same in the post office, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his address of record.  On or before the date of acquisition proposed in the plan, the parent corporation shall file with the insurance commissioner a certificate, executed by its president and attested by its secretary, or the executive officers corresponding thereto, and subscribed by such officers and affirmed by them as true under the penalties of perjury, and under the seal of the parent corporation, attesting to compliance by the parent corporation with this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Upon compliance with this section, ownership of the shares to be acquired pursuant to the plan shall vest in the parent corporation on the date of acquisition proposed in the plan whether or not the certificates for such shares have been surrendered for exchange and the parent corporation shall be entitled to have new certificates registered in its name.  Stockholders whose shares have been so acquired shall thereafter retain only the right either to receive the consideration to be paid in exchange for their shares pursuant to the plan or to demand appraisal pursuant to paragraph VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A stockholder whose stock is acquired pursuant to this section and who elects to dissent from such acquisition shall, by complying with this paragraph and with RSA 293-A:13.01 through RSA 293-A:13.31, have the right to receive payment in cash for the fair value of his shares, subject to final approval by the insurance commissioner, by filing a written notice of his election to dissent and a demand for payment to him for his stock at its fair value with the parent corporation within 30 days after the delivery to him of either a copy of the plan or a summary thereof, pursuant to paragraph IV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:17 Recovery. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order shall have a right to recover, on behalf of the insurer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) From any parent corporation or holding company or person or affiliate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions (other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock) paid by the insurer on its capital stock.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or a subsidiary of the insurer to a director, officer or employee, where the distribution or payment pursuant to subparagraphs (a) or (b) is made at any time during the one year preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation, as the case may be, subject to the limitations of paragraphs II-IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No such distribution shall be recoverable if the parent or affiliate shows that when paid such distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that such distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time such distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions or payments under paragraph I such person received.  Any person who otherwise controlled the insurer at the time such distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately.  If 2 or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The maximum amount recoverable under this section shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. To the extent that any person liable under paragraph III is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it pursuant to such paragraph, its parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from such parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it.
