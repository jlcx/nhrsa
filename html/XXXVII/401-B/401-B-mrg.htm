<center><h3>Section 401-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:1 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An "affiliate'' of, or person "affiliated'' with, a specific person, is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Commissioner'' means the insurance commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Control'' (including the terms "controlling,'' "controlled by'' and "under common control with'') means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract other than a commercial contract for goods or non-management services, or otherwise, unless the power is the result of an official position with or corporate office held by the person.  Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the voting securities of any other person.  This presumption may be rebutted by a showing made in the manner provided by RSA 401-B:4, XI that control does not exist in fact.  The commissioner may determine, after furnishing all persons in interest notice and opportunity to be heard and making specific findings of fact to support such determination, that control exists in fact, notwithstanding the absence of a presumption to that effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Department'' means the department of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An "insurance holding company system'' consists of 2 or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Insurer'' shall have the same meaning as set forth in RSA 401-B:3-a, IV(b)(3)(A) except that it shall not include agencies, authorities or instrumentalities of the United States, its possessions and territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, or a state or political subdivision of a state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Enterprise risk'' means any activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial conditions or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole, including, but not limited to, anything that would cause the insurer's risk-based capital to fall into company action level as set forth in RSA 404-F:3 or would cause the insurer to be in hazardous financial condition (Ins 2900).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "NAIC'' means the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. "Person'' means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization, any similar entity or any combination of the foregoing acting in concert, but shall not include any joint venture partnership exclusively engaged in owning, managing, leasing, or developing real or tangible personal property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A "security holder'' of a specified person is one who owns any security of such person, including common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and any other security convertible into or evidencing the right to acquire any of the foregoing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. A "subsidiary'' of a specified person is an affiliate controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Voting security'' shall include any security convertible into or evidencing a right to acquire a voting security.

<center><h3>Section 401-B:2</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:2 Subsidiaries of Insurers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Authorization.  Any domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may organize or acquire one or more subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and their authority to do so shall not be limited by reasons of the fact that they are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Additional Investment Authority.  In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted under this title, a domestic insurer may also:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Invest, in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the insurer's assets or 50 percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after such investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs.  In calculating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries and health maintenance organizations shall be excluded, and there shall be included:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities;  and all contributions to the capital or surplus of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer, provided that each such subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that such investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in subparagraph II(a).  For the purpose of this paragraph, "the total investment of the insurer'' shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of the subsidiary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) With the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries;  provided that after the investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Exemption from Investment Restrictions.  Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to paragraph II, shall not be subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this chapter applicable to such investments of insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Qualification of Investment;  When Determined.  Whether any investment made pursuant to paragraph II meets the applicable requirements of that paragraph is to be determined before the investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Cessation of Control.  If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment therein made pursuant to this section within 3 years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment shall have been made, the investment shall have met the requirements for investment under any other section of this chapter, and the insurer has notified the commissioner.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Approval by Commissioner;  Hearings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in paragraph I unless, after a public hearing, the commissioner finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After the change of control the domestic insurer referred to in paragraph I would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly.  In applying the competitive standard in this subparagraph:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The informational requirements of RSA 401-B:3-a, III(a) and the standards of RSA 401-B:3-a, IV(b) shall apply;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the commissioner finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by RSA 401-B:3-a, IV(c) exist;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The public hearing referred to in subparagraph VI(a) shall be held within 30 days after the statement required by paragraph I is filed and at least 20 days' notice shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement.  Not less than 7 days' notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to such other persons as may be designated by the commissioner.  The insurer shall give such notice to its security holders.  The commissioner shall make a determination within the 60-day period preceding the effective date of the proposed transaction.  At such hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection therewith shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the superior court of this state.  All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than 3 days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in subparagraph (b) may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in paragraph I.  Such person shall file the statement referred to in paragraph I with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) within 5 days of making the request for a public hearing.  A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within 10 days of the receipt of the statement referred to in paragraph I.  A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled.  Such commissioners shall hear and receive evidence.  A commissioner may attend such hearing, in person or by telecommunication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the commissioner that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and regulations of this state shall be made not later than 60 days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to subparagraph I(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Exemptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt as not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer, or as otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Violations.  The following shall be violations of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to paragraph I or II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Jurisdiction;  Consent to Service of Process.  The courts of this state are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and over all actions involving such person arising out of violations of this section, and each the person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by the person of the commissioner to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of violations of this section.  Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to the person at his last known address.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:3-a Acquisitions Involving Insurers Not Otherwise Covered. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Definitions.  In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Acquisition'' means any agreement, arrangement or activity, the consummation of which results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, and includes but is not limited to the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An "involved insurer'' includes an insurer which either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Scope.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Except as exempted in subparagraph II(b), this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This section shall not apply to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes as long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state.  If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under RSA 401-B:1, III, it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if pre-acquisition notification is filed with the commissioner in accordance with subparagraph III(a) 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition.  However, such pre-acquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other provision of RSA 401-B:3-a, II(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The acquisition of already affiliated persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed 5 percent of the total market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) There would be no increase in any market share;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) In no market would:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The combined market share of the involved insurers exceed 12 percent of the total market;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The market share increase by more than 2 percent of the total market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
For the purpose of this subparagraph, a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) An acquisition for which a pre-acquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds that such insurer is in failing condition;  there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition;  the public benefits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition;  and the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Pre-Acquisition Notification;  Waiting Period.  An acquisition covered by paragraph II may be subject to an order pursuant to paragraph V, unless the acquiring person files a pre-acquisition notification and the waiting period has expired.  The acquired person may file a pre-acquisition notification.  The commissioner shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this paragraph in the same manner as provided in RSA 401-B:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The pre-acquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the NAIC relating to those markets which, under subparagraph II(b)(4), cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section.  The commissioner may require such additional material and information as deemed necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of paragraph IV.  The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the commissioner of a pre-acquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of the receipt, or termination of the waiting period, by the commissioner.  Prior to the end of the waiting period, the commissioner on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the commissioner or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Competitive Standard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner may enter an order under subparagraph V(a) with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of subparagraph IV(a) the commissioner shall consider the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any acquisition covered under paragraph II involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:
<PRE>
 Insurer A Insurer B 
 4 percent 4 percent or more 
 10 percent 2 percent or more 
 15 percent 1 percent or more 
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Or, if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:
<PRE>
 Insurer A Insurer B 
 5 percent 5 percent or more 
 10 percent 4 percent or more 
 15 percent 3 percent or more 
 19 percent 1 percent or more 
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the 4 largest insurers is 75 percent or more of the market.  Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown.  If more than 2 insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the 2 columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subparagraph IV(a).  For the purpose of this subparagraph, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be insurer A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the 2 largest to the 8 largest, has increased by 7 percent or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year 5 to 10 years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition.  Any acquisition or merger covered under paragraph II involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subparagraph IV(a) if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Another involved insurer's market is 2 percent or more.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) For the purposes of subparagraph IV(b):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The term "insurer'' includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership, or control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The term "market'' means the relevant product and geographical markets.  In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the NAIC and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition.  In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs IV(b)(1) and (2), the commissioner may establish the requisite anti-competitive effect based upon other substantial evidence.  Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs IV(b)(1) and (2), a party may establish the absence of the requisite anti-competitive effect based upon other substantial evidence.  Relevant factors in making a determination under this subparagraph include, but are not limited to, the following:  market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An order may not be entered under subparagraph V(a) if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Orders and Penalties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a)(1) If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the commissioner may enter an order:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2)(A) Such an order shall not be entered unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) There is a hearing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) Notice of such hearing to be issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than 15 days prior to the hearing;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) The hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than 60 days after the date of the filing of the pre-acquisition notification with the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the commissioner setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) An order pursuant to subparagraph V(a) shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner under subparagraph V(a) and while the order is in effect may, after notice and hearing and upon order of the commissioner be subject at the discretion of the commissioner to one or more of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for every day of violation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Suspension or revocation of the person's license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any such filing requirement, shall be subject to an administrative fine of not more than $50,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Inapplicable Provisions.  RSA 401-B:10, II and III and RSA 401-B:12 shall not apply to acquisitions covered under paragraph II.

A disclaimer of affiliation shall be deemed to have been granted unless the commissioner, within 30 days following receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is disallowed.  In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted.  The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the commissioner, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.

(6) The insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section, which are subject to any materiality standards contained in RSA 401-B:5, I-VII, may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into the transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or such shorter period as the commissioner may permit, and the commissioner has not disapproved it within such period.  The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees, and all cost-sharing arrangements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Guarantees when made by a domestic insurer;  provided, however, that a guarantee which is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirements of this paragraph unless it exceeds the lesser of  1/2 of one percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 10 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31, next preceding.  Further, all guarantees which are not quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that controls the insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount which, together with its present holdings in such investments, exceeds 2- 1/2 percent of the insurer's surplus to policyholders.  Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in subsidiaries acquired pursuant to RSA 401-B:2 or authorized under any other section of this chapter, or in non-subsidiary insurance affiliates that are subject to the provisions of this chapter, are exempt from this requirement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Any material transactions, specified by rule, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise.  If the commissioner determines that separate transactions were entered into over any 12-month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise his or her authority under RSA 401-B:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subparagraph I(b), shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards of subparagraph I(a) and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The commissioner shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10 percent of the corporation's voting securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Dividends and Other Distributions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Until the commissioner has approved the payment within the 30-day period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) For the purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Ten percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the December 31, next preceding;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending December 31, next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous 2 calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends.  This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the commissioner's approval, and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The commissioner has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commissioner has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period referred to above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Management of Domestic Insurers Subject to Registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identify consistent with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subparagraph I(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Not less than  1/3 of the directors of a domestic insurer, and not less than  1/3 of the member of each committee of the board of directors of any domestic insurer shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or entity.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The provisions of subparagraphs (c) and (d) shall not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer, such as an insurer, a mutual insurance holding company, or a public held corporation, has a board of directors and committees thereof that meet the requirements of subparagraphs (c) and (d) with respect to such controlling entity.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The adequacy of the insurer's reserves.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.  Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court.  Every person shall be obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the state.  He or she shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in RSA 516:13, RSA 516:14, and RSA 516:16, which fees, mileage, and actual expense, if any, necessarily incurred in securing the attendance of witnesses, and their testimony, shall be itemized and charged against, and be paid by, the company being examined.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Voting of Securities;  When Prohibited.  No security which is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or which is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the commissioner hereunder may be voted at any shareholders' meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though the securities were not issued and outstanding;  but no action taken at any such meeting shall be invalidated by the voting of the securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state have so ordered.  If an insurer or the commissioner has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the commissioner hereunder;  the insurer or the commissioner may apply to the superior court for Merrimack county or to the superior court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business to enjoin any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition made in contravention of RSA 401-B:3 or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the commissioner thereunder to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of the security already cast at any meeting of shareholders, and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions or payments under paragraph I which the person received.
