Unless the commissioner by rule, regulation, or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments, or guarantees involving  1/2 of one percent or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of the 31st day of December next preceding shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Exemptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurer, information or transaction if and to the extent that the commissioner by rule, regulation, or order shall exempt the same from the provisions of this section.

The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material relationships and bases for affiliation between the person and the insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming the affiliation.  A disclaimer of affiliation shall be deemed to have been granted unless the commissioner, within 30 days following receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is disallowed.  In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted.  The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the commissioner, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Enterprise Risk Filing.  The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report.  The report shall, to the best of the ultimate controlling person's knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer.  The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Violations.  The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by this section within the time specified for such filing shall be a violation of this section.
