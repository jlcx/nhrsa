<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Registration.  Every insurer which is authorized to do business in this state and which is a member of an insurance holding company system shall register with the commissioner, except a foreign insurer subject to disclosure requirements and standards adopted by statute or regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile which are substantially similar to those contained in RSA 401-B:4 and 401-B:5.  Any insurer which is subject to registration under this section shall register within 60 days after the effective date of this chapter or 15 days after it becomes subject to registration, whichever is later, unless the commissioner for good cause shown extends the time for registration, and then within such extended time.  The commissioner may require any authorized insurer which is a member of a holding company system which is not subject to registration under this section to furnish a copy of the registration statement or other information filed by such insurance company with the insurance regulatory authority of domiciliary jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Information and Form Required.  Every insurer subject to registration shall file a registration statement on a form provided by the commissioner, which shall contain current information about:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The capital structure, general financial condition, ownership and management of the insurer and any person controlling the insurer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The identity and relationship of every member of the insurance holding company system;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The following agreements in force, relationships subsisting, and transactions currently outstanding between such insurer and its affiliates:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Loans, other investments, or purchases, sales or exchanges of securities of the affiliates by the insurer or of the insurer by its affiliates;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Purchases, sales, or exchanges of assets;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Transactions not in the ordinary course of business;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Guarantees or undertakings for the benefit of an affiliate which result in an actual contingent exposure of the insurer's assets to liability, other than insurance contracts entered into in the ordinary course of the insurer's business;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) All management and service contracts and all cost-sharing arrangements;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Reinsurance agreements;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Consolidated tax allocation agreements;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) Any pledge of the insurer's stock, including stock of any subsidiary or controlling affiliate for a loan made to any member of the insurance holding company system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Other matters concerning transactions between registered insurers and any affiliates as may be included from time to time in any registration forms adopted or approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Materiality.  No information need be disclosed on the registration statement filed pursuant to RSA 401-B:4, II, if such information is not material for the purposes of this section.  Unless the commissioner by rule, regulation or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, or investments, involving  1/2 of one percent or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Amendments to Registration Statements.  Each registered insurer shall keep current information required to be disclosed in its registration statement by reporting all material changes or additions on amendment forms provided by the commissioner within 15 days after the end of the month in which it learns of each such change or addition, provided, however, that subject to RSA 401-B:5, III, each registered insurer shall so report all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within 2 business days following the declaration thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Termination of Registration.  The commissioner shall terminate the registration of any insurer which demonstrates that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Consolidated Filing.  The commissioner may require or allow 2 or more affiliated insurers subject to registration hereunder to file a consolidated registration statement or consolidated reports amending their consolidated registration statement or their individual registration statements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Alternative Registration.  The commissioner may allow an insurer which is authorized to do business in this state and which is part of an insurance holding company system to register on behalf of any affiliated insurer which is required to register under RSA 401-B:4, I, and to file all information and material required to be filed under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Exemptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurer, information or transaction if and to the extent that the commissioner by rule, regulation, or order shall exempt the same from the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Disclaimer.  Any person may file with the commissioner a disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer or such a disclaimer may be filed by such insurer or any member of an insurance holding company system.  The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material relationships and bases for affiliation between such person and such insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming such affiliation.  After a disclaimer has been filed, the insurer shall be relieved of any duty to register or report under this section which may arise out of the insurer's relationship with such person unless and until the commissioner disallows such a disclaimer.  The commissioner shall disallow such a disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest with notice and opportunity to be heard and after making specific findings of fact to support such disallowance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Violations.  The failure to file a registration statement or any amendment thereto required by this section within the time specified for such filing shall be a violation of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Outlining Changes.  All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items in the current registration statement representing changes from the prior registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Complete and Accurate Information.  Any person with an insurance holding company system subject to registration shall be required to provide complete and accurate information to an insurer, where such information is reasonably necessary to enable the insurer to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
