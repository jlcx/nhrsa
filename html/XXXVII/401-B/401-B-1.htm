&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-B:1 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the respective meanings hereinafter set forth, unless the context shall otherwise require:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An "affiliate'' of, or person "affiliated'' with, a specific person, is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The term "commissioner'' shall mean the insurance commissioner, his deputies, or the insurance department, as appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The term "control'' (including the terms "controlling'', "controlled by'' and "under common control with'') means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract other than a commercial contract for goods or non-management services, or otherwise, unless the power is the result of an official position with or corporate office held by the person.  Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the voting securities of any other person.  This presumption may be rebutted by a showing made in the manner provided by RSA 401-B:4, IX that control does not exist in fact.  The commissioner may determine, after furnishing all persons in interest notice and opportunity to be heard and making specific findings of fact to support such determination, that control exists in fact, notwithstanding the absence of a presumption to that effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An "insurance holding company system'' consists of 2 or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Insurer'' shall include every person engaged in the business of entering into policies of insurance except that it shall not include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Agencies, authorities or instrumentalities of the United States, its possessions and territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, or a state or political subdivision of a state,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fraternal benefit societies, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nonprofit medical and hospital service associations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A "person'' is an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization, any similar entity or any combination of the foregoing acting in concert, but shall not include any securities broker performing no more than the usual and customary broker's function.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A "security holder'' of a specified person is one who owns any security of such person, including common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and any other security convertible into or evidencing the right to acquire any of the foregoing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A "subsidiary'' of a specified person is an affiliate controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The term "voting security'' shall include any security convertible into or evidencing a right to acquire a voting security.
