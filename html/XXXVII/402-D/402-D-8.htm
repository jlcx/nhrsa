&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person is currently licensed as a resident public adjuster and in good standing in his or her home state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person has submitted the proper request for licensure, has paid the fees required by RSA 400-A:29, and has provided proof of financial responsibility as required in RSA 402-D:11;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person has submitted or transmitted to the commissioner the appropriate completed application for licensure;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The person's home state awards non-resident public adjuster licenses to residents of this state on the same basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may verify the public adjuster's licensing status through the producer database maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), its affiliates, or subsidiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As a condition to continuation of a public adjuster license issued under this section, the licensee shall maintain a resident public adjuster license in his or her home state.  The non-resident public adjuster license issued under this section shall terminate and be surrendered immediately to the commissioner if the home state public adjuster license terminates for any reason.
