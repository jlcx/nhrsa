I. No contract in writing for the adjustment or appraisal for any loss shall be made until a copy of the form of such contract has been on file for 30 days with the commissioner, unless before the expiration of that period the commissioner shall have approved the form in writing, provided that the commissioner may disapprove the form within the 30-day period.
<br>
