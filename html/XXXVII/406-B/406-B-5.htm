&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any act of doing an insurance business as set forth in RSA 406-B:2 by any unlicensed person or insurer is equivalent to and shall constitute irrevocable appointment by such person or insurer, binding upon such persons or insurer, his or her executor, administrator or personal representative, or successor in interest if a corporation, of the secretary of state, his or her successor or successors in office to be the true and lawful attorney of such person or insurer upon whom may be served all legal process in any action, suit or proceeding in any court by the commissioner or by the state and upon whom may be served any notice, order, pleading or process in any proceeding before the commissioner and which arises out of doing an insurance business in this state by such person or insurer.  Any act of doing an insurance business as set forth in RSA 406-B:2 by any unlicensed person or insurer shall be signification of its agreement that any such legal process in such court action, suit or proceeding and any such notice, order, pleading or process in such administrative proceeding before the commissioner so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as personal service of process in this state upon such person or insurer, or upon his or her executor, administrator or personal representative, or its successor in interest if a corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such service of process in such action, suit or proceeding in any court or such notice, order, pleading or process in such administrative proceeding authorized by paragraph I shall be made by leaving 2 copies thereof in the hands or office of the secretary of state.  A certificate by the secretary of state showing such service and attached to the original or third copy of such process presented to him for that purpose shall be sufficient evidence thereof.  Service upon the secretary of state as such attorney shall be service upon the principal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The secretary of state shall forthwith mail one copy of such court process or such notice, order, pleading or process in proceedings before the commissioner to the defendant in such court proceeding or to whom the notice, order, pleading or process in such administrative proceeding is addressed or directed at its last known principal place of business and shall keep a record of all process so served on him which shall show the day and hour of service.  Such service is sufficient, provided notice of such service and a copy of the court process or the notice, order, pleading or process in such administrative proceeding are sent within 10 days thereafter by registered mail by the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney in the court proceeding or by the commissioner in the administrative proceeding to the defendant in the court proceeding or by whom the notice, order, pleading or process in such administrative proceeding is addressed or directed at its last known principal place of business of the defendant in the court or administrative proceeding, and the defendant's receipt, or receipt issued by the post office with which the letter is registered, showing the name of the sender of the letter and the name and address of the person or insurer to whom the letter is addressed, and the affidavit of the plaintiff or plaintiff's attorney in court proceeding or of the commissioner in administrative proceeding, showing compliance herewith are filed with the clerk of the court in which such action, suit or proceeding is pending or with the commissioner in administrative proceedings, on or before the date the defendant in the court or administrative proceeding is required to appear or respond thereto, or within such further time as the court or commissioner may allow.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No plaintiff or complainant shall be entitled to a judgment or determination by default in any court or administrative proceeding in which court process or notice, order, pleading, or process in proceedings before the commissioner is served under this section until the expiration of 45 days from the date of filing of the affidavit of compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing contained in this section shall limit or abridge the right to serve any process, notice, order, pleading or demand upon any person or insurer in any other manner now or hereafter permitted by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The attorney general upon request of the commissioner is authorized to proceed in the courts of this or any other state or in any federal court or agency to enforce an order or decision in any court proceeding or in any administrative proceeding before the commissioner.
