<center><h2>CHAPTER 406-B<br>UNAUTHORIZED INSURANCE</h2></center>
<center><h3>Section 406-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 406-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to subject certain persons and insurers to the jurisdiction of the commissioner, of proceedings before the commissioner, and of the courts of this state in suits by or on behalf of the state and insureds or beneficiaries under insurance contracts.  The legislature declares that it is a subject of concern that many residents of this state hold policies of insurance issued by persons and insurers not authorized to do business in this state, thus presenting to such residents the often insuperable obstacle of asserting their legal rights under such policies in forums foreign to them under laws and rules of practice with which they are not familiar.  The legislature declares that it is also concerned with the protection of residents of this state against acts by persons and insurers not authorized to do an insurance business in this state by the maintenance of fair and honest insurance markets, by protecting authorized persons and insurers, which are subject to strict regulation, from unfair competition by unauthorized persons and insurers by protecting against the evasion of the insurance regulatory laws of this state and to protect the premium tax revenues of this state.  In furtherance of such state interest, the legislature herein provides methods for substituted service of process upon such persons or insurers in any proceeding, suit or action in any court and substitute service of any notice, order, pleading or process upon such persons or insurers in any proceeding before the commissioner to enforce or effect full compliance with the insurance and tax statutes of this state, and declares in so doing it exercises its power to protect residents of this state and to define what constitutes doing an insurance business in this state, and also exercises powers and privileges available to this state by virtue of P.L. 79-15 (1945), (chapter 20, 1st sess., S. 340), 59 Stat. 33, as amended, which declares that the business of insurance and every person engaged therein shall be subject to the laws of the several states.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 406-B:6 Unauthorized Person or Insurer Defense of Action. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Before any unauthorized person or insurer files or causes to be filed any pleading in any court action, suit or proceeding or in any notice, order, pleading, or process in such administrative proceeding before the commissioner instituted against such person or insurer, by service made as provided in RSA 406-B:4 and 5, such person or insurer shall either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Deposit with the clerk of the court in which such action, suit or proceeding is pending, or with the commissioner in administrative proceedings before the commissioner, cash or securities or bond with good and sufficient sureties to be approved by the court, or the commissioner, in any amount to be fixed by the court or the commissioner sufficient to secure the payment of any final judgment which may be rendered in such court proceeding or in such administrative proceeding before the commissioner, provided that the court or the commissioner in administrative proceedings before the commissioner may in its or his discretion make an order dispensing with such deposit or bond where the insurer makes a showing satisfactory to such court or the commissioner that it maintains in a state of the United States funds or securities, in trust or otherwise, sufficient and available to satisfy any final judgment which may be entered in such court action, suit or proceeding or in such administrative proceeding before the commissioner;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Procure proper authorization to do an insurance business in this state.
<br>

II. The court in any action, suit or proceeding in which service has been made as provided in RSA 406-B:4 or the commissioner in any administrative proceeding before the commissioner in which service is made as provided in RSA 406-B:5 may, in his or its discretion, order such postponement as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to comply with paragraph I and to defend such court action or administrative proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in paragraph I is to be construed to prevent an unlicensed person or insurer from filing a motion to quash a writ or to set aside service thereof made as provided in RSA 406-B:4 or 5 on the ground that such unlicensed person or insurer has not done any of the acts enumerated in RSA 406-B:2 or that the person on whom service was made pursuant to RSA 406-B:4 was not doing any of the acts therein enumerated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 406-B:7 Attorney Fees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In an action against an unauthorized person or insurer upon a contract of insurance issued or delivered in this state to a resident thereof or to a corporation authorized to do business therein, if the person or insurer has failed for 30 days after demand prior to the commencement of the action to make payment in accordance with the terms of the contract, and it appears to the court that such refusal was vexatious and without reasonable cause, the court may allow to the plaintiff a reasonable attorney fee and include such fee in any judgment that may be rendered in such action.  Failure of the person or insurer to defend any such action shall be deemed prima facie evidence that its failure to make payment was vexatious and without reasonable cause.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The failure of an insurer transacting insurance business in this state to obtain a certificate of authority shall not impair the validity of any act or contract of such insurer and shall not prevent such insurer from defending any action at law or suit in equity in any court of this state, but no insurer transacting insurance business in this state without a certificate of authority shall be permitted to maintain an action in any court of this state to enforce any right, claim or demand arising out of the transaction of such business until such insurer shall have obtained a certificate of authority.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever the commissioner has reason to believe that insurance has been effectuated by or for any person in this state with an unauthorized insurer, the commissioner shall in writing order such person to produce for examination all insurance contracts and other documents evidencing insurance with both authorized and unauthorized insurers and to disclose to the commissioner the amount of insurance, name and address of each insurer, gross amount of premium paid or to be paid and the name and address of the person or persons assisting or aiding in the solicitation, negotiation or effectuation of such insurance.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever the commissioner believes, from evidence satisfactory to him, that any insurer is violating or about to violate the provisions of this act, the commissioner may, with the assistance of the attorney general of this state, cause a complaint to be filed in the Merrimack county superior court to enjoin and restrain such insurer from continuing such violation or engaging therein or doing any act in furtherance thereof.  The court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall have the power to make and enter an order or judgment awarding such preliminary or final injunctive relief as in its judgment is proper.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 406-B:11 Unauthorized Insurance Premium Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as to premiums on lawfully procured surplus lines insurance pursuant to the surplus lines laws of this state, and premiums on unlicensed insurance procured by industrial insurers on which a tax has been paid pursuant to RSA 406-B:16, VI and premiums on independently procured insurance on which a tax has been paid pursuant to RSA 406-B:17, every unauthorized insurer shall pay to the commissioner before March 1 next succeeding the calendar year in which the insurance was so effectuated, continued or renewed a premium receipts tax of 4 percent of gross premiums charged for such insurance other than marine insurance and a premium receipts tax of 2 percent of gross premiums charged for such marine insurance on subjects resident, located or to be performed in this state.  Such insurance on subjects resident, located or to be performed in this state procured through negotiations or an application, in whole or in part occurring or made within or from within or outside of this state, or for which premiums in whole or in part are remitted directly or indirectly from within or outside of this state, shall be deemed to be insurance procured, or continued or renewed in this state.  The term "premium'' includes all premiums, membership fees, assessments, dues, and any other consideration for insurance.  Such tax shall be in lieu of all taxes and fire department dues.  On default of any such unauthorized insurer in the payment of such tax the insured shall pay the tax.  If the tax prescribed by this section is not paid within the time stated, the tax shall be increased by a penalty of 25 percent and by the amount of an additional penalty computed at the rate of one percent per month or any part thereof from the date such payment was due to the date paid.

II. If a policy covers risks or exposures only partially in this state, the tax payable shall be computed on the portions of the premium which are properly allocable to the risks or exposures located in this state.  In determining the amount of premiums taxable in this state, all premiums written, procured, or received in this state and all premiums on policies negotiated in this state shall be deemed written on property or risks located or resident in this state, except such premiums as are properly allocated or apportioned and reported as taxable premiums of any other state or states.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Definition.  In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Reciprocal state'' means any state or territory of the United States the laws of which contain procedures substantially similar to those specified in this section for the enforcement of decrees or orders in equity issued by courts located in other states or territories of the United States, against any insurer incorporated or authorized to do business in said state or territory.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Foreign decree'' means any decree or order in equity of a court located in a "reciprocal state'', including a court of the United States located therein, against any insurer incorporated or authorized to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Qualified party'' means a state regulatory agency acting in its capacity to enforce the insurance laws of its state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. List of Reciprocal States.  The insurance commissioner of this state shall determine which states and territories qualify as reciprocal states and shall maintain at all times an up-to-date list of such states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Filing and Status of Foreign Decrees.  A copy of any foreign decree authenticated in accordance with the statutes of this state may be filed in the office of the clerk of any superior court of this state.  The clerk, upon verifying with the insurance commissioner that the decree or order qualifies as a "foreign decree'' shall treat the foreign decree in the same manner as a decree of a superior court of this state.  A foreign decree so filed has the same effect and shall be deemed as a decree of a superior court of this state, and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a decree of a superior court of this state and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notice of Filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At the time of the filing of the foreign decree, the attorney general shall make and file with the clerk of the court an affidavit setting forth the name and last known post office address of the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Promptly upon the filing of the foreign decree and the affidavit, the clerk shall mail notice of the filing of the foreign decree to the defendant at the address given and to the insurance commissioner of this state and shall make a note of the mailing in the docket.  In addition, the attorney general may mail a notice of the filing of the foreign decree to the defendant and to the insurance commissioner of this state and may file proof of mailing with the clerk.  Lack of mailing notice of filing by the clerk shall not affect the enforcement proceedings if proof of mailing by the attorney general has been filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No execution or other process for enforcement of a foreign decree filed hereunder shall issue until 30 days after the date the decree is filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Stay.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the defendant shows the superior court that an appeal from the foreign decree is pending or will be taken, or that a stay of execution has been granted, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign decree until the appeal is concluded, the time for appeal expires, or the stay of execution expires or is vacated, upon proof that the defendant has furnished the security for the satisfaction of the decree required by the state in which it was rendered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 406-B:17 Independently Procured Insurance. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every insured who procures or causes to be procured or continues or renews insurance with any unlicensed insurer, or any insured or self-insurer who so procures or continues excess loss, catastrophe or other insurance, upon a subject of insurance resident, located or to be performed within this state, other than insurance procured through a surplus lines agent pursuant to the surplus lines law of this state shall within 60 days after the date such insurance was so procured, continued, or renewed, file a report of the same with the commissioner in writing and upon forms designated by the commissioner and furnished to such an insured upon request.  The report shall show the name and address of the insured or insureds, name and address of the insurer, the subject of the insurance, a general description of the coverage, the amount of premium correctly charged therefor, and such additional pertinent information as is reasonably requested by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any insurance in an unlicensed insurer of a subject of insurance resident, located or to be performed within this state procured through negotiations or an application, in whole or in part occurring or made within or from within or outside of this state, shall be deemed to be insurance procured, or continued or renewed in this state within the intent of paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. There is hereby levied upon the obligation, chose in action, or right represented by the premium charged for such insurance, a premium receipts tax of 4 percent of gross premiums charged for such insurance other than marine insurance and a premium receipts tax of 2 percent of gross premiums charged for such marine insurance.  The term "premium'' shall include all premiums, membership fees, assessments, dues, and any other consideration for insurance.  Such tax shall be in lieu of all taxes and fire department dues.  The insured shall, before March 1 next succeeding the calendar year in which the insurance was so procured, continued, or renewed, pay the amount of the tax to the commissioner.  In the event of cancellation and rewriting of any such insurance contract, the additional premium for premium receipts tax purposes shall be the premium in excess of the unearned premium of the canceled insurance contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a policy covers risks or exposures only partially in this state, the tax payable shall be computed on the portions of the premium which are properly allocable to the risks or exposures located in this state.  In determining the amount of premiums taxable in this state, all premiums written, procured, or received in this state and all premiums on policies negotiated in this state shall be deemed written on property or risks located or resident in this state, except such premiums as are properly allocated or apportioned and reported as taxable premiums of any other state or states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the insured fails to withhold from the premiums the amount of tax herein levied, the insured shall be liable for the amount thereof and shall pay the same to the commissioner within the time stated in paragraph III.  If the tax prescribed by this section is not paid within the time stated in paragraph III, the tax shall be increased by a penalty of 25 percent and by the amount of an additional penalty computed at the rate of one percent per month or any part thereof from the date such payment was due to the date paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The attorney general, upon request of the commissioner, shall proceed in the courts of this or any other state or in any federal court or agency to recover such tax not paid within the time prescribed in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. This section shall not be construed or deemed to abrogate or modify any provision of this chapter.  This section does not apply to individual life or individual disability insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Each insured filing under this section shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 400-A:32-a, I-III.
