The purpose of this chapter is to subject certain persons and insurers to the jurisdiction of the commissioner, of proceedings before the commissioner, and of the courts of this state in suits by or on behalf of the state and insureds or beneficiaries under insurance contracts.  The legislature declares that it is a subject of concern that many residents of this state hold policies of insurance issued by persons and insurers not authorized to do business in this state, thus presenting to such residents the often insuperable obstacle of asserting their legal rights under such policies in forums foreign to them under laws and rules of practice with which they are not familiar.  The legislature declares that it is also concerned with the protection of residents of this state against acts by persons and insurers not authorized to do an insurance business in this state by the maintenance of fair and honest insurance markets, by protecting authorized persons and insurers, which are subject to strict regulation, from unfair competition by unauthorized persons and insurers by protecting against the evasion of the insurance regulatory laws of this state and to protect the premium tax revenues of this state.  In furtherance of such state interest, the legislature herein provides methods for substituted service of process upon such persons or insurers in any proceeding, suit or action in any court and substitute service of any notice, order, pleading or process upon such persons or insurers in any proceeding before the commissioner to enforce or effect full compliance with the insurance and tax statutes of this state, and declares in so doing it exercises its power to protect residents of this state and to define what constitutes doing an insurance business in this state, and also exercises powers and privileges available to this state by virtue of P.L. 79-15 (1945), (chapter 20, 1st sess., S. 340), 59 Stat. 33, as amended, which declares that the business of insurance and every person engaged therein shall be subject to the laws of the several states.
