<codesect>
In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on the estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in RSA 410:4, 410:4-a and 410:7, the reserves which are held under any such plan must:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this chapter as determined by rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A.
