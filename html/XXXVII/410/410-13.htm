<codesect>
In the case of a plan of life insurance that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on its estimates of future experience, or in the case of a plan of life insurance or annuity that is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in RSA 410:8, 410:9 and 410:12, the reserves that are held under the plan shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
