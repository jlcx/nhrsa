<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to the effective date of this chapter may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to such date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the commissioner, issued on or after the effective date of this chapter, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any such company which at any time shall have adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided may, with the approval of the commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum herein provided.  However, for the purposes of this action, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by RSA 410:2-a shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.
