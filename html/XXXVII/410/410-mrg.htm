<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1982;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1982, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1982, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearest  1/4 of one percent:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) For life insurance
<PRE>
 I = .03 + W (R''1%48 - .03 + W. (R''2%48 - .09);
 ----

</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I = .03 + W (R - .03)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Where R<sub>1</sub> is the lesser of R and .09,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
R<sub>2</sub>is the greater of R and .09,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
R is the reference interest rate defined in this section,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
W is the weighting factor defined in this section,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subparagraph (2), the formula for life insurance stated in subparagraph (1) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of 10 years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (2) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (2) shall apply,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (2) shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this subparagraph differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than  1/2 of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year.  For purposes of applying this subparagraph, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined in 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when RSA 409:5-b becomes operative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<PRE>
 Plan Type 
 A B C 
 .05 .05 .05 
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years.  For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Plan type as used in the above tables is defined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Plan type A:  At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only (i) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (ii) without such adjustment but in installments over 5 years or more, or (iii) as an immediate life annuity, or (iv) no withdrawal permitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Plan type B:  Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only (i) with adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (ii) without an adjustment but in installments over 5 years or more, or (iii) no withdrawal permitted.  At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without an adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Plan type C:  Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than 5 years either (i) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (ii) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis.  Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis.  In this section, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph II shall be defined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (b), with guarantee duration in excess of 10 years, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (b), with guarantee duration of 10 years or less, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in subparagraph (b), the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Alternative Method for Determining Reference Interest Rates.  In the event that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by rule adopted by the commissioner may be substituted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 410:8 Reserve Valuation Method;  Life Insurance and Endowment Benefits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 410:9 and 410:12, reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by those policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor.  The modified net premiums for a policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (a) over subparagraph (b), as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one percent per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due.  However, the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For a life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1985, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this section as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in RSA 410:12, be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph I and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph I, but with (a) the value defined in subparagraph (a) of paragraph I being reduced by 15 percent of the amount of such excess first year premium, (b) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (c) the policy being assumed to mature on that date as an endowment, and (d) the cash surrender value provided on that date being considered as an endowment benefit.  In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in RSA 410:6 and 410:7 shall be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of the preceding paragraphs of this section for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts;  and
