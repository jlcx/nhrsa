&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 410:2 Valuation of Reserves for Life Insurance Policies and Annuity and Pure Endowment Contracts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The insurance commissioner shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (hereinafter called reserves) for all outstanding life insurance policies and annuity and pure endowment contracts of every life insurance company doing business in this state, except that in the case of an alien company, such valuation shall be limited to its United States business, and may certify the amount of any such reserves, specifying the mortality table or tables, rate or rates of interest and methods (net level premium method or other) used in the calculation of such reserves.  In calculating such reserves, he may use group methods and approximate averages for fractions of a year or otherwise.  In lieu of the valuation of the reserves herein required of any foreign or alien company, he may accept any valuation made, or caused to be made, by the insurance supervisory official of any state or other jurisdiction when such valuation complies with the minimum standard herein provided and if the official of such state or jurisdiction accepts as sufficient and valid for all legal purposes the certificate of valuation of the commissioner when such certificate states the valuation to have been made in a specified manner according to which the aggregate reserves would be at least as large as if they had been computed in the manner prescribed by the law of that state or jurisdiction.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A memorandum, in form and substance acceptable to the commissioner as specified by rule, shall be prepared to support each actuarial opinion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the insurance company fails to provide a supporting memorandum at the request of the commissioner within a period specified by rule or the commissioner determines that the supporting memorandum provided by the insurance company fails to meet the standards prescribed by the rules or is otherwise unacceptable to the commissioner, the commissioner may engage a qualified actuary at the expense of the company to review the opinion and the basis for the opinion and prepare such supporting memorandum as is required by the commissioner.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Requirement for All Opinions.  Every opinion shall be governed by the following provisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Disciplinary action by the commissioner against the company or the qualified actuary shall be defined in rules by the commissioner.

(h) Any memorandum in support of the opinion, and any other material provided by the company to the commissioner in connection therewith, shall be kept confidential by the commissioner and shall not be made public and shall not be subject to subpoena, other than for the purpose of defending an action seeking damages from any person by reason of any action required by this section or by rules adopted under this section;  provided, however, that the memorandum or other material may otherwise be released by the commissioner (1) with the written consent of the company or (2) to the American Academy of Actuaries upon request stating that the memorandum or other material is required for the purpose of professional disciplinary proceedings and setting forth procedures satisfactory to the commissioner for preserving the confidentiality of the memorandum or other material.

I. This section shall apply to the interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1982, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1982, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearest  1/4 of one percent:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) For life insurance,
<PRE>
 I = .03 + W (R''1%48 - .03) + W (R''2%48 - .09);
 ----

</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, I = .03 + W (R - .03) where I is the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate, R<sub>1</sub> is the lesser of R and .09, R<sub>2</sub> is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this section, and W is the weighting factor defined in this section,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subparagraph (2), the formula for life insurance stated in subparagraph (1) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of 10 years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (2) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less,

(b) However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this subparagraph differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than  1/2 of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year.  For purposes of applying this subparagraph, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when RSA 409:5-b becomes operative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The weighting factors referred to in the formulas in paragraph II are given in the following tables:

</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years.  For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Plan type as used in the above tables is defined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Plan type A:  At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only (i) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (ii) without such adjustment but in installments over 5 years or more, or (iii) as an immediate life annuity, or (iv) no withdrawal permitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Plan type B:  Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only (i) with adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (ii) without such adjustment but in installments over 5 years or more, or (iii) no withdrawal permitted.  At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Plan type C:  Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than 5 years either (i) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (ii) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis.  Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis.  As used in this section, "an issue year basis of valuation'' refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and "the change in fund basis of valuation'' refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The "reference interest rate'' referred to in paragraph II shall be defined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 410:4 Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 410:4-a and 410:7, reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of such future guaranteed benefits provided for by such policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums of such policies.  The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (a) over subparagraph (b), as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one percent per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due;  provided, however, that such net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A net one-year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first policy year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1985, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination of both in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this section as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in RSA 410:7, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph I and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph I, but with (a) the value defined in subparagraph (a) of paragraph I being reduced by 15 percent of the amount of such excess first year premium, (b) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (c) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and (d) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit.  In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in RSA 410:3-a and 3-b shall be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method for:  (a) life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;  (b) group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended;  (c) disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts;  and (d) all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of the preceding paragraphs of this section, except that any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards shall be disregarded in the determination of modified net premiums.

This section shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended.  Reserves according to the commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year.  The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits.  The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I.

II. Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the commissioner, issued on or after the effective date of this chapter, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any such company which at any time shall have adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided may, with the approval of the commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum herein provided.  However, for the purposes of this action, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by RSA 410:2-a shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.

I. If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurance company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve on such policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for such policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium.  The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this section are those standards stated in RSA 410:3 and 410:3-b.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1985, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination of both in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this section shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in RSA 410:4, I.  The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with RSA 410:4, I and II, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this section.
