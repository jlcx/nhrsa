&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:13 Competitive Market. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A competitive market is presumed to exist unless the commissioner, after hearing, determines that a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the market and the commissioner issues a ruling to that effect.  Such ruling shall expire no later than one year after issue unless the commissioner renews the ruling after hearings and a finding as to the continued lack of a reasonable degree of competition.  In determining whether a reasonable degree of competition exists, the commissioner shall consider relevant tests of workable competition pertaining to market structure, market performance and market conduct and the practical opportunities available to consumers in the market to acquire pricing and other consumer information and to compare and obtain insurance from competing insurers as further described in RSA 412:14.
