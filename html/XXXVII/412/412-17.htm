No insurance company authorized to transact business in this state, which insures against loss by reason of the liability to pay damages to others for damage to property or bodily injury including death, arising from the operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles within this state, shall cancel, reduce liability limits, refuse to renew, or increase the premium of any such motor vehicle policy for the sole reason that the person to whom such policy has been issued has reached a certain age.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to an increase or decrease of the premiums for such policies for any particular age group if a statewide classification system approved by the insurance commissioner is adopted for such drivers.
