The commissioner may, as often as he or she deems it expedient, make or cause to be made an examination of each advisory organization or statistical agent referred to in RSA 412:20 and of each group, association or other organization referred to in RSA 412:26, provided that each statistical agent and advisory organization licensed in this state shall be examined at least once every 5 years.  The reasonable costs of any such examination shall be paid by the advisory organization, statistical agent or group, association or other organization examined.  The officers, manager, agents and employees of such advisory organization, statistical agent, or group, association or other organization may be examined at any time under oath and shall exhibit all books, records, account, documents or agreements governing its method of operation.
