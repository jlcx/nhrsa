&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No insurer shall issue any motor vehicle liability policy, with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state, that does not provide at least the minimum coverage set forth in RSA 264.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No liability policy issued or delivered in this state that insures against personal risk shall contain any exclusion which would preclude coverage for intra-family or inter-spousal claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When an automobile insurance policy contains coverage for physical damage by reason of collision, any deductible amount of such coverage shall not apply if the damage is caused by an uninsured motor vehicle, including a motor vehicle which is uninsured within the definition of RSA 259:117, and the operator of the uninsured vehicle has been positively identified and is solely at fault.
