<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the event that a company or filing or advisory organization eliminates or reduces coverages, conditions, or definitions in its policies issued under this section other than at the request of a policyholder, the company shall attach to the policy a printed notice in each such policy explaining clearly what coverages, conditions, or definitions have been eliminated or reduced.  If explanations of such reduced or eliminated coverages are not contained in the printed notice attached to its policies, then such coverages, conditions, or definitions shall remain in full force and effect without such reductions or eliminations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in paragraph III, no insurance policy renewal shall add any stand-alone, premium bearing coverage unless such coverage is added at the request of the policyholder or is due to a requirement imposed by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the policyholder has not requested that new premium bearing coverage be added to a policy upon renewal, but such coverage is added because the company is replacing coverage or a policy that the company no longer offers, the company shall provide a printed notice explaining clearly what coverage has been added and how to obtain information concerning premium impact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The requirements of this section shall apply to such policies renewed or endorsed with the same company, or a group of companies affiliated by ownership or contractual relationship encompassing joint operations or processes as filed and approved by the commissioner.
