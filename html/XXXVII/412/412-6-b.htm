<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"This certificate of insurance is issued as a matter of information only and confers no rights upon the certificate holder.  This certificate does not amend, extend, or alter the coverage, terms, exclusions, and conditions afforded by the policy or policies referenced herein.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The requirements of this section shall apply to certificates of insurance issued as evidence of insurance policies and coverage on property, operations, or any risk located in this state, regardless of where the certificate holder, policyholder, insurer, or insurance producer is located.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner may publish sample certificates of insurance which provide templates as to form and content, which, in his or her opinion, meet the requirements of subparagraph (b) and are acceptable for use by insurers and insurance producers.
