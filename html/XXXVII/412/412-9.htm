&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:9 Prohibition on Nonresident Automobile Insurance. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no individual shall be provided coverage under a policy of automobile insurance, as defined in RSA 417-A, if such individual is determined by the insurer to have falsely attested to the statement required in RSA 417-A:3-b at the time such policy was issued or renewed.  Payment shall be made by the insurer with respect to accidents which occur in New Hampshire for all valid bodily injury and property damage liability claims and all valid uninsured motorist claims by individuals other than the applicant or applicants for insurance who signed the statement required by RSA 417-A:3-b arising under such policy;  however, the insurer shall be legally entitled to reimbursement by the policyholder for all such paid claims.
