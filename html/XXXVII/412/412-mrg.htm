&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:13 Competitive Market. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A competitive market is presumed to exist unless the commissioner, after hearing, determines that a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the market and the commissioner issues a ruling to that effect.  Such ruling shall expire no later than one year after issue unless the commissioner renews the ruling after hearings and a finding as to the continued lack of a reasonable degree of competition.  In determining whether a reasonable degree of competition exists, the commissioner shall consider relevant tests of workable competition pertaining to market structure, market performance and market conduct and the practical opportunities available to consumers in the market to acquire pricing and other consumer information and to compare and obtain insurance from competing insurers as further described in RSA 412:14.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:14 Monitoring Competition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In determining whether or not a competitive market exists pursuant to RSA 412:13, the commissioner shall monitor the degree of competition in this state.  In doing so, the commissioner shall utilize existing relevant information, analytical systems and other sources;  cause or participate in the development of new relevant information, analytical systems and other sources;  or rely on some combination thereof.  Such activities may be conducted internally within the insurance department, in cooperation with other state insurance departments, through outside contractors or in any other appropriate manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All of the following may be considered by the commissioner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The extent to which the largest insurer groups control the insurance marketplace.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whether the total number of companies writing the form of insurance in this state is sufficient to provide multiple options to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The extent to which insurer entries and exits, considered over several years, suggest the presence or lack of entry or exit barriers or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The degree to which the insurance products offered to consumers are homogenous in nature and, thus, comparable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The availability of insurance coverage in all geographic areas.  A review of changes in residual market shares, if applicable, may be used as an indication of availability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The overall rate level which is not excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The trend in price level for each type of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The profitability of each form of insurance over a period of several years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The level of knowledge of market participants and the extent to which comparative pricing information has been made readily available to consumers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The extent to which the market for each type of insurance is growing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) The presence of conditions indicating reverse competition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Any other factors customarily reviewed and considered relevant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section, the commissioner may, at any time, request information or data from insurers authorized to conduct business in this state that the commissioner believes relevant to monitoring and maintaining a competitive market.

<center><h3>Section 412:15</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:15 Rate Standards. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Rates shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A rate in a competitive market is not excessive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A rate in a noncompetitive market is excessive if it is likely to produce a profit that is unreasonably high for the insurance provided or if expenses are unreasonably high in relation to services rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A rate is inadequate if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The rate is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and the continued use of the rate endangers the solvency of the insurer using it;  or unless
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The rate is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and the use of the rate by the insurer has, or if continued will have, the effect of substantially lessening competition or the tendency to create monopoly in any market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Unfair discrimination exists if, after allowing for practical limitations, price differentials fail to reflect equitably the differences in expected losses and expenses.  A rate is not unfairly discriminatory if it is averaged broadly among persons insured under a group, franchise or blanket policy or a mass marketed plan.  In this paragraph, a mass marketed plan means a method of selling property-liability insurance wherein:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The insurance is offered to employees of particular employers or to members of particular associations or organizations or to persons grouped in other ways, except groupings formed principally for the purpose of obtaining such insurance;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The employer, association or other organization, if any, has agreed to, or otherwise affiliated itself with, the sale of such insurance to its employees or members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining whether rates comply with the excessiveness standard in a noncompetitive market under subparagraph I(b), the inadequacy standards under subparagraph I(c) and the unfair discrimination standard under subparagraph I(d), the following criteria shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Due consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss experience within and outside this state;  to the conflagration and catastrophe hazards;  to a reasonable margin for profit and contingencies;  to dividends, savings, or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers;  to past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this state;  and to provisions for special assessments and to all other relevant factors within and outside the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums.  Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans that establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both.  Such standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.  No risk classification, however, may be based upon race, creed, national origin or the religion of the insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The expense provisions included in the rates to be used by an insurer shall reflect the operating methods of the insurer and its anticipated expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The rates may contain provision for contingencies and an allowance permitting a reasonable profit.  In determining the reasonableness of the profit, consideration shall be given to all investment income attributable to the line of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The use of any information from credit reports, credit histories, and credit scoring models for underwriting and rating purposes for homeowners insurance and private passenger automobile insurance shall be based upon objective, documented, and measurable standards and shall be used in a manner which provides for appropriate consumer protections, including adequate and clear consumer notice, procedures to promptly correct and adjust underwriting or rating decisions based on incorrect credit information, and confidentiality protections.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The insurance commissioner shall, pursuant to RSA 541-A, adopt such rules as may be necessary to regulate the obligations of insurers with respect to the use of such information in the underwriting and rating of homeowners insurance and private passenger automobile insurance.  Information that explains and justifies underwriting rules, credit scoring models or rating plans that rely upon credit reports, credit histories, or credit scoring mechanisms shall be included in the rate filing required pursuant to RSA 412:16.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may permit insurers to use appropriate systems of schedule rating filed by any insurer or rating bureau approved by the commissioner, subject to rules adopted under RSA 541-A, to assure the uniform and impartial application of such rating.  Such ratings shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Based on an insured's management, safety, and loss control policies and record;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No greater than plus or minus 40 percent of the insurer's base rates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In order to further uniform administration of rate regulatory laws, the commissioner and every insurer, advisory organization and statistical agent may exchange information and experience data with insurance supervisory officials, insurers and advisory organizations in other states and may consult with them with respect to the application of rating systems and the collection of statistical data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:16 Rate Filings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Financial guaranty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Employment practices liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Commercial inland marine that is not written according to manual rates or rating plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Directors and officers liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Boiler and machinery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Commercial credit insurance products.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every insurer shall file with the commissioner, except as to inland marine risks which are not written according to manual rates or rating plans, every manual, predictive models or telematics models or other models that pertain to the formulation of rates and/or premiums, minimum premium, class rate, rating schedule or rating plan and every other rating rule, and every modification of any of the foregoing which it proposes to use.  Personal lines filings shall include underwriting rules used by insurers or a group of affiliated insurers to the extent necessary to determine the applicable rate and/or policy premium for an individual insured or applicant.  An insurer may file its rates by either filing its final rates or by filing a multiplier and, if applicable, an expense constant adjustment to be applied to prospective loss costs that have been filed by an advisory organization on behalf of the insurer as permitted by RSA 412:23.  Every such filing shall state the effective date, and shall indicate the character and extent of the coverage contemplated.  Information contained in the underwriting rules that does not pertain to the formulation of rates and/or premiums shall be identified by the filer as proprietary and shall be kept confidential by the department and shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every insurer shall file or incorporate by reference to material that has been filed with or approved by the commissioner, at the same time as the filing of the rate, all supplementary rating and supporting information to be used in support of or in conjunction with a rate.  The information furnished in support of a filing may include or consist of a reference to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The experience or judgment of the insurer or information filed by the advisory organization on behalf of the insurer as permitted by RSA 412:23;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Its interpretation of any statistical data it relies upon;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The experience of other insurers or advisory organizations;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any other relevant factors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When a filing is not accompanied by the information upon which the insurer supports such filing, the commissioner may require such insurer to furnish the required information upon which it supports such filing.  Until the requested information is provided, the filing shall not be considered complete and may be subject to possible disapproval pursuant to the provisions of RSA 412:19, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. After reviewing an insurer's filing if the commissioner finds that the data upon which the filing is based is fully credible under acceptable actuarial standards and practices, the commissioner may require that the insurer's rates be based upon the insurer's own loss, special assessment and expense information.  If the insurer's loss or allocated loss adjustment expenses information is not actuarially credible, as determined by the commissioner, the insurer may use or supplement its experience with information filed with the commissioner by an advisory organization or statistical agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Insurers utilizing the services of an advisory organization or statistical agent shall provide with their rate filing, at the request of the commissioner, a description of the rationale for such use, including its own information and method of utilization of the advisory organization's or statistical agent's information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In a competitive market, every insurer, except as specified in this chapter, shall file with the commissioner the information specified in this section that it will use in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For all personal risk policies, the rates and supplementary rating information shall be filed with the commissioner at least 30 days before the effective date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For all commercial risk policies, except policies issued to a large commercial policyholder, and except as provided in this chapter, the rates and supplementary rating information that will be used in this state shall be filed for informational purposes only within 30 days of the effective date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For policies of insurance issued to large commercial policyholders, defined in RSA 412:3, XI, the filing requirements of this section shall not apply.  Information relating to classifications, rules, and rates applicable to any policy issued to a large commercial policyholder pursuant to this paragraph shall be kept available by the insurer for inspection by the commissioner, upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) All policies issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall contain a conspicuous disclaimer printed in at least 10-point, bold-faced type that states that the policy applied for, including the rates, rating plans, resulting premiums, and the policy forms, are not subject to the rate and form requirements of this state and other provisions of the insurance law that apply to other commercial products and may contain significant differences from a policy that is subject to all provisions of the insurance law.  Such notice shall set forth possible differences in policy conditions, forms, and endorsements, as compared to a policy that is subject to all of the provisions of the insurance law.  The commissioner may prescribe the format and provisions of such notice.  The disclosure notice will also include a policyholder's acknowledgment statement, to be signed and dated prior to the effective date of the coverage, and shall remain on file with the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In procuring insurance, a large commercial policyholder shall certify that it meets the eligibility requirements set out in RSA 412:3, XI and specify the requirements that the policyholder has met.  This certification is to be completed annually and remain on file with the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A surplus lines broker seeking to obtain or provide insurance for a large commercial policyholder is not authorized to purchase insurance from any eligible unauthorized insurer without making a diligent search of authorized insurers as required by RSA 405:24.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In a competitive market, if the commissioner finds, after a hearing that an insurer's rates require closer supervision because of the insurer's financial condition or unfairly discriminatory rating practices, the insurer shall file with the commissioner at least 30 days before the effective date, all such rates and supplementary rating information and supporting information as prescribed by the commissioner.  Upon application by the filer, the commissioner may authorize an earlier effective date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In a noncompetitive market, subject to the exceptions specified in RSA 412:16, IX and X, and RSA 412:28, each filing shall be on file for a waiting period of 30 days before it becomes effective, which period may be extended by the commissioner for an additional period not to exceed 60 days if written notice is given within such waiting period to the insurer or advisory organization which made the filing that additional time is needed for the consideration of the filing.  Upon written application by the insurer, the commissioner may authorize a filing that has been reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension thereof.  A filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this chapter unless disapproved by the commissioner within the waiting period or any extension thereof.  Failure of the insurer or advisory organization to provide the requested information within the waiting period or the extension thereof shall be deemed a request to withdraw the filing from further consideration.  Failure of the commissioner to act within the waiting period or the extension thereof shall result in the filing being deemed to meet the requirements of this chapter.  Neither the insurer nor the commissioner may waive the timeliness requirements of the provisions in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The commissioner may, by written order, suspend or modify the requirement of filing as to any kind of insurance, subdivision or combination thereof, or as to classes of risks, for which the rates cannot practicably be filed before they are used.  The commissioner may make such examination as deemed advisable to ascertain whether any rates affected by such order meet the standards set forth in RSA 412:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Upon the written application of the insured, stating his or her reasons therefor, filed with and approved by the commissioner, a rate in excess of or below that provided by a filing otherwise applicable may be used on any specific risk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. A filing and any supporting information not considered proprietary pursuant to paragraph II shall be open to public inspection on or after the effective date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. No insurer shall make or issue a contract or policy except in accordance with the filings that are in effect for the insurer as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. A rate for a residual market in which insurers are mandated by law to participate shall not become effective until approved by the commissioner.

For purposes of this section, "volunteer driver'' means a person who provides services, including transporting individuals or goods, without compensation above expenses to a charitable organization as defined in RSA 7:21.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:19 Disapproval of Filings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For filings made in a noncompetitive market and residual market filings, if within the waiting period or any extension thereof as provided in RSA 412:16, VIII, the commissioner finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, written notice of disapproval shall be sent to the insurer or advisory organization which made the filing, specifying therein in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements of this chapter and stating that such filing shall not become effective.  If the commissioner disapproves a filing, the insurer or advisory organization may request a hearing on the disapproval within 30 days and the commissioner shall schedule that hearing within 30 days of the receipt of the request.  The insurer or advisory organization bears the burden of proving compliance with the standards established by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If at any time after a rate has been approved and for filings made in a competitive market, the commissioner finds that the rate no longer meets the requirements of this chapter, the commissioner may order the discontinuance of use of the rate.  The order of discontinuance may be issued after a hearing with at least 10 days' prior notice to all insurers affected by the order.  The order must be in writing and state the grounds for the order.  It shall also state when, within a reasonable time thereafter, the filing will be deemed no longer effective.  The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order.  However, a policyholder shall have the privilege to cancel the policy containing the disapproved rate without penalty.  The commissioner's order may include a provision for a premium adjustment for contracts or policies made or issued after the effective date of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any insured aggrieved with respect to any filing which is in effect may make written application to the commissioner for a hearing thereon.  The application shall specify the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant.  If the commissioner shall find that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if his or her grounds are established, and that such grounds otherwise justify holding such a hearing, a hearing shall be held within 30 days after receipt of such application upon not less than 10 days' written notice to the applicant and to every insurer and advisory organization which made such filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If, after such hearing, the commissioner finds that the filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, an order shall be issued specifying in what respects such filing fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, such filing shall no longer be deemed to be in effect.  Copies of the order shall be sent to the applicant and to every such insurer and advisory organization.  The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result of the commissioner's disapproval of rates or other act, the commissioner shall on request of the insurer specify interim rates for the insurer that are high enough to protect the interests of all parties and may order that a specified portion of the premiums be placed in an escrow account approved by the commissioner.  When the new rates become legally effective, the commissioner shall order the escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates be distributed appropriately.

(c) If the commissioner finds that the application and the natural persons through whom it acts are competent, trustworthy, and technically qualified to provide the services proposed, and that all requirements of the law are met;  he or she shall issue a license specifying the authorized activity of the applicant.
