Every insurer, that insures employers against liability for compensation under the workers' compensation law, RSA 281-A, shall file with the insurance commissioner individually or in collaboration with others, in such form as the commissioner may prescribe every manual, minimum premium, class rate, rating schedule, or rating plan and every other rating rule, and every modification of any of the foregoing that it proposes to use;  provided, that none of the above shall take effect until the commissioner shall have approved the same as adequate, not excessive, and not unfairly discriminatory.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At the same time as a filing made pursuant to paragraphs I and II, every insurer shall file, or incorporate by reference any material that has been filed with and approved by the commissioner, all supplementary statistical and supporting information to be used as justification for this filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
