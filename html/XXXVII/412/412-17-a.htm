&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 412:17-a Volunteer Drivers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
An insurer may not refuse to issue a policy of automobile insurance, as defined in RSA 417-A, to an applicant solely because the applicant is a volunteer driver.  An insurer may not impose a surcharge or otherwise increase the rate for a policy of automobile insurance solely on the basis that the named insured, a member of the insured's household, or a person who customarily operates the insured's vehicle is a volunteer driver.  For purposes of this section, "volunteer driver'' means a person who provides services, including transporting individuals or goods, without compensation above expenses to a charitable organization as defined in RSA 7:21.  This section does not prohibit an insurer from refusing to renew, imposing a surcharge, or otherwise raising the rate for a policy of automobile insurance based upon factors other than the volunteer status of the insured driver.
