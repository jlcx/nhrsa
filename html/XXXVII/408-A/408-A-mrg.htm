<codesect>
The term of any credit life insurance or credit accident and health insurance shall, subject to acceptance by the insurer, commence on the date when the debtor becomes obligated to the creditor, or the date from which interest or finance charges accrue if later, except that, where a group policy provides coverage with respect to existing obligations, the insurance on a debtor with respect to such indebtedness shall commence on the effective date of the policy.  Where evidence of insurability is required and such evidence is furnished more than 30 days after the date when the debtor becomes obligated to the creditor, the term of the insurance may commence on the date on which the insurance company determines the evidence to be satisfactory, and in such event there shall be an appropriate refund or adjustment of any charge to the debtor for insurance.  The term of such insurance shall not extend more than 15 days beyond the scheduled maturity date of the indebtedness except when extended without additional cost to the debtor.  If the indebtedness is discharged due to renewal or refinancing prior to the scheduled maturity date, the insurance in force shall be terminated before any new insurance may be issued in connection with the renewed or refinanced indebtedness.  In all cases of termination prior to scheduled maturity, a refund shall be paid or credited as provided in RSA 408-A:8.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Said individual policy or group certificate of insurance shall be delivered to the insured debtor at the time the indebtedness is incurred except as hereinafter provided.

I. Each insurer issuing credit life insurance or credit accident and health insurance shall file with the commissioner its schedules of premium rates for use in connection with such insurance.  Any insurer may revise such schedules from time to time, and shall file such revised schedules with the commissioner.  No insurer shall issue any credit life insurance policy or credit accident and health insurance policy for which the premium rate exceeds that determined by the schedules of such insurer as then on file with the commissioner.  The commissioner may require the filing of the schedule of premium rates for use in connection with and as a part of the specific policy filings as provided by RSA 408-A:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each individual policy, group certificate or notice of proposed insurance shall provide that in the event of termination of the insurance prior to the scheduled maturity date of the indebtedness, any refund of an amount paid by the debtor for insurance shall be paid or credited promptly to the person entitled thereto within 30 days from the termination of the insurance;  provided, however, that the commissioner shall prescribe a minimum refund and no refund which would be less than such minimum need be made.  The formula to be used in computing such refund shall be filed with and approved by the commissioner.
