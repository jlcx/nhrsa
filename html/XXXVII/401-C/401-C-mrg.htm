&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-C:1 Purpose and Scope. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the requirements for maintaining a risk management framework and completing Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and provide guidance and instructions for filing an ORSA summary report with the insurance commissioner of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all insurers domiciled in this state unless exempt pursuant to RSA 401-C:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The general court finds and declares that the ORSA summary report will contain confidential and sensitive information related to an insurer or insurance group's identification of risks material and relevant to the insurer or insurance group filing the report.  This information will include proprietary and trade secret information that has the potential for harm and competitive disadvantage to the insurer or insurance group if the information is made public.  It is the intent of this chapter that the ORSA summary report shall be a confidential document filed with the commissioner, that the ORSA summary report will be shared only as stated in this chapter and to assist the commissioner in the performance of his or her duties, and that in no event shall the ORSA summary report be subject to public disclosure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-C:5 ORSA Summary Report. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the commissioner's request, and no more than once each year, an insurer shall submit to the commissioner an ORSA summary report or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA guidance manual, applicable to the insurer and/or the insurance group of which it is a member.  Notwithstanding any request from the commissioner, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report or reports required by this section if the commissioner is the lead state commissioner of the insurance group as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The report shall include a signature of the insurer or insurance group's chief risk officer or other executive having responsibility for the oversight of the insurer's enterprise risk management process attesting to the best of his or her belief and knowledge that the insurer applies the enterprise risk management process described in the ORSA summary report and that a copy of the report has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An insurer may comply with paragraph I by providing the most recent and substantially similar reports provided by the insurer or another member of an insurance group of which the insurer is a member to the commissioner of another state or to a supervisor or regulator of a foreign jurisdiction, if that report provides information that is comparable to the information described in the ORSA guidance manual.  Any such report in a language other than English shall be accompanied by a translation of that report into the English language.

<br><center>[RSA 401-C:6 effective January 1, 2015.]</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-C:6 Exemption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An insurer shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The insurer has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium, including international direct and assumed premium but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and Federal Flood Program, less than $500,000,000;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The insurance group of which the insurer is a member has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium including international direct and assumed premium, but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and Federal Flood Program, less than $1,000,000,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an insurer qualifies for exemption pursuant to subparagraph I(a), but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subparagraph I(b), then the ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to RSA 401-C:5 shall include every insurer within the insurance group.  This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one ORSA summary report for any combination of insurers provided any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subparagraph I(a), but the insurance group of which it is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to subparagraphs I(b), then the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to RSA 401-C:5 shall be the report applicable to that insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An insurer that does not qualify for exemption pursuant to paragraph I may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this chapter based upon unique circumstances.  In deciding whether to grant the insurer's request for waiver, the commissioner may consider the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, and any other factor the commissioner considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member.  If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one state, the commissioner shall coordinate with the lead state commissioner and with the other domiciliary commissioners in considering whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report based on unique circumstances including, but not limited to, the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests, and international supervisor requests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report if the insurer has risk-based capital for company action level event as set forth in RSA 404-F:3, meets one or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition, as defined in Ins 1500, or otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If an insurer that qualifies for an exemption pursuant to paragraph I subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to changes in premium as reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer shall have one year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
