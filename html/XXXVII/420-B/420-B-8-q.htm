&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-B:8-q Coverage for Dependents. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the coverage for dependent children includes coverage for dependent children who are full-time students, as defined by the appropriate educational institution, beyond the age of 18, such dependent coverage shall include coverage for a dependent's medically necessary leave of absence from school for a period not to exceed 12 months or the date on which coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy, whichever comes first.  Any breaks in the school semester shall not disqualify the dependent child from coverage under this section.  Documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be submitted to the insurer by the student's attending physician and shall be considered prima facie evidence of entitlement to coverage under this section.  The date of the documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be the date the insurance coverage under this section commences.
