&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-B:8 Forms of Evidence of Coverage. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No evidence of coverage, or amendment thereto, shall be issued to any person in this state until a copy of the evidence of coverage, or amendment thereto including all rates to be charged, has been filed with and approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every health maintenance organization shall provide evidence of coverage to each enrolled participant.  If the enrolled participant obtains coverage through an insurance policy or a contract issued by a hospital, medical or health service corporation, whether by option or otherwise, the insurer or hospital or medical service corporation shall issue the evidence of coverage.  Otherwise, the health maintenance organization shall issue the evidence of coverage.  When a group of enrolled participants comprise a family unit a single evidence of coverage of said family unit shall be sufficient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All forms of evidence of coverage issued by the health maintenance organization to enrolled participants, or other marketing documents purporting to describe the organization's health care services, shall contain clear and complete information indicating:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The health care services and other benefits to which the enrolled participant is entitled;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any exclusions or any limitations on services or any other benefits to be provided, including any deductible or co-payment feature or any restrictions relating to pre-existing conditions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Where and in what manner information is available as to how services may be obtained;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The predetermined periodic rate of payment for health care services and other benefits and other charges, if any, which the enrolled participant is obliged to pay;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) All criteria relating to disenrollment or denials of re-enrollment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) With respect to subscribers with Medicare supplement insurance benefits, the health maintenance organization shall allow each such subscriber a period of at least one year after the incurral of a covered expense within which the subscriber shall furnish any proof of loss required by the insurer.  Failure to furnish such proof within such time shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to furnish such proof and such proof was furnished as soon as was reasonably possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. Every health maintenance organization shall state on its forms of evidence of coverage that a maternity benefits rider will be made available at the request of the enrolled participant, if maternity care is not covered in the insurance policy, contract or evidence of coverage.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to apply to supplemental health insurance and disability insurance policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-b. The coverage of any family member insured by such policy, pursuant to RSA 420-B:8-aa, I, who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his or her own living as of the date on which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as such dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the policyholder or the employee or his or her estate is chargeable for the care of such dependent;  provided, that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-c. Non-group contracts issued by a health maintenance organization shall contain the following provision:  Insurance with Other Insurers.  If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or an expense incurred basis, payment shall not be prorated or reduced.  In such a case, the insured shall be entitled to payment from both insurers.  However, the provisions of this paragraph shall not prohibit the issuance of contracts including a "benefits deductible.''  The term "benefits deductible,'' as used in this paragraph means the term as defined in RSA 415:6, II(4).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The periodic rate of payment for health care services and other benefits and other charges, if any, included in any form of evidence of coverage shall be reasonable in relation to the benefits and health care services provided and not excessive, inadequate or discriminatory.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A grace period shall be allowed the enrolled participant for making any payment due under the contract.  Such period shall not be less than 10 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No health maintenance organization authorized under this chapter shall cancel the enrollment of an enrolled participant or refuse to transfer an enrolled participant from a group to an individual basis for reasons relating to health status.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All advertising intended for use in this state whether through written, radio, or television medium shall be submitted to the commissioner of this state for review and approval by the commissioner prior to use, except that the commissioner may waive prior approval for any such materials which the department of health and human services has approved for use in the medicaid program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner may, at any time, after a hearing, if one is requested, withdraw his approval of any advertising, evidence of coverage or amendment thereto on any of the grounds stated as material to approval.  It shall be unlawful for any health maintenance organization to issue any evidence of coverage or amendment thereto after the effective date of such withdrawal of approval.

I. (a) Benefits for mental or nervous conditions shall conform to the requirements of RSA 415:18-a or alternatively with the basic health services requirements of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-222), any amendments, and federal regulations issued under the authority of such federal law.

The coinsurance required by the enrolled participant shall not exceed 20 percent of the reasonable and customary charge for the services provided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (a), every health maintenance organization offering such benefits shall provide to its subscribers a list of psychiatrists and mental health care providers within the organization's network.

Benefits for such services shall be as favorable as for other psychiatric or psychological services, including psychological examinations, and shall be subject to the same dollar limits, deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance factors and to terms and conditions of the policy or certificate, including any managed care provisions.
<br>

This term shall not include chemical dependency including alcoholism.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-B:8-n Point of Service Plans. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A health maintenance organization may offer a point-of-service plan in accordance with the requirements of this section.  A point-of-service plan is a health maintenance organization contract which includes coverage for both in-network services and coverage for services provided by non-contracted providers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A point-of-service plan offered by a health maintenance organization shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide incentives for enrollees to use in-network covered services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Offer out-of-network covered services only if those services are also covered on an in-network basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Cover out-of-network emergency services as if they had been provided in-network.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A point-of-service plan offered by a health maintenance organization may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Limit or exclude specific types of services, other than emergency services, from coverage when obtained out-of-network.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Include provisions for member cost sharing, annual out-of-pocket limits and annual and lifetime benefit allowances for out-of-network covered services which are separate from any limits and allowances applied to in-network covered services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Cover at the out-of-network benefit level, services provided by a participating provider for which proper authorization or referral was not obtained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Subject to the provisions of RSA 420-G, a health maintenance organization may limit the groups to which point-of-service plans are offered.  If a point-of-service plan is offered to a group, it must be offered to all eligible members of the group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A health maintenance organization may not expend more than 20 percent of its total annual health care expenditures on out-of-network covered services.  If compliance with this requirement is not demonstrated on a quarterly basis on the health maintenance organization's quarterly financial report, the commissioner may prohibit the health maintenance organization from offering a point-of-service plan to new groups until compliance has been demonstrated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A health maintenance organization shall comply with all applicable form and rate filing requirements.  In complying with said requirements, the health maintenance organization shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Design the benefit levels for in-network covered services and out-of-network covered services to achieve the desired level of in-network utilization;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provide or arrange for adequate systems to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Process and pay claims for out-of-network covered services;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Meet the requirements for point-of-service plans under this section;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Generate accurate financial and regulatory reports on a timely basis in order for the commissioner to evaluate experience with the point of service plan and monitor compliance with the requirements of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. An explanation of benefits shall be provided to enrollees who obtain services at the out-of-network benefit level which is adequate to permit the enrollee to determine his or her financial liability under the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. All point-of-service contracts and certificates shall contain a provision permitting the enrollee to assign any benefits provided for medical or dental care on an expense-incurred basis to the provider of care.  An assignment of benefits under this paragraph does not affect or limit the payment of benefits otherwise payable under the contract or certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Subscriber contracts and member handbooks shall contain a clear and concise explanation of the point of service plan.  The explanation shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The method of reimbursement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The required co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, as applicable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Other uncovered costs or charges;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The services that an enrollee is permitted to obtain at the out-of-network benefit level;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Instructions for submitting claims for services obtained at the out-of-network benefit level.

The existence of a court order under RSA 169-B, RSA 169-C, or RSA 169-D for a service, program, or placement that is covered under any insurance for the minor shall not be considered in determining qualification for third-party payment under such insurance.  Benefits for such services shall be subject to the same dollar limits, deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance factors and to the terms and conditions of the policy or certificate, including any managed care provisions.  However, the claimant or claimant's representative shall have 48 hours from the commencement of a court-ordered service, placement, or program to seek any pre-authorization, pre-certification, or referral required under the terms of the policy.  The determination of these preservice claims for court-ordered services for a minor shall be made as soon as possible, taking into account the medical exigencies, but in no event later than 48 hours after receipt of the request and sufficient information, unless the claimant or claimant's representative fails to provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, benefits are covered or payable.  In the case of such failure, the insurer shall notify the claimant or claimant's representative within 24 hours of receipt of the request and shall advise the claimant or claimant's representative of the specific information necessary to determine to what extent benefits are covered or payable.  The claimant or claimant's representative shall be afforded a reasonable amount of time, taking into account the circumstances, but not less than 48 hours, to provide the specified information.  Thereafter, notification of the claim determination shall be made as soon as possible, but in no case later than 48 hours after the earlier of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-B:12 Prohibited Practices. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No health maintenance organization, or representative thereof, may cause or knowingly permit the use of advertising which is untrue or misleading, solicitation which is untrue or misleading, or any form of evidence of coverage which is deceptive.  For purposes of this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A statement or item of information shall be deemed to be untrue if it does not conform to fact in any respect which is or may be significant to an enrolled participant of, or person considering enrolling in, a health maintenance organization;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement or item of information shall be deemed to be misleading, whether or not it may be literally true, if, in the total context in which such statement is made or such item of information is communicated, such statement or item of information reasonably may be understood by a reasonable person, not possessing special knowledge regarding health care coverage, as indicating any benefit or advantage or the absence of any exclusion, limitation, or disadvantage of possible significance to an enrolled participant of, or person considering enrollment in, a health care plan, if such benefit or advantage or absence of limitation, exclusion or disadvantage does not in fact exist;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An evidence of coverage shall be deemed to be deceptive if the evidence of coverage taken as a whole, and with consideration given to typography and format, as well as language, shall be such as to cause a reasonable person, not possessing special knowledge regarding health care plans or evidences of coverage therefor, to expect benefits, services, charges, or other advantages which the evidence of coverage does not provide or which the health care plan issuing such evidence of coverage does not regularly make available for enrolled participants covered under such evidence of coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the event that a person is covered by more than one plan that requires pre-certification, the member shall obtain pre-certification from the primary plan.  Although the member shall not be required to obtain pre-certification from the secondary plan, the secondary plan shall not be required to treat such services as covered services if the services do not meet its certification criteria.  The secondary plan shall not refuse payment for such services solely on the basis that the services were not pre-certified by the secondary plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. RSA 406-A and RSA 417 shall be construed to apply to health maintenance organizations and evidences of coverage, except to the extent that the commissioner determines that the nature of the health maintenance organizations, and evidences of coverage render such statutes inappropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No health maintenance organization, unless licensed as an insurer, may use in its name, evidences of coverage, contracts, or literature, any of the words "insurance,'' "casualty,'' "surety,'' "mutual,'' or any other words descriptive of the insurance, casualty, or surety business or deceptively similar to the name or description of any insurance or surety corporation doing business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No health maintenance organization shall exclude part-time employees or refuse to offer the same insurance benefits to part-time employees as it offers to the employee groups of which the part-time employees would be members if they were full-time employees.  The insurer shall offer to include the part-time employees as part of the employer's employee group, at the full rate to be paid by the employer, at a rate prorated between the employer and the employee, or at the employee's expense.  A part-time employee shall be any employee who regularly works at least half of the weekly hours of the full-time employee in the employee group of which the part-time employee would be a member if he were a full-time employee, but who works a minimum of at least 15 hours per week.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Every health maintenance organization which solicits bids from pharmacies for contracts to be preferred providers shall accept and list as preferred providers all pharmacies which meet the bid acceptable to the health maintenance organization.
<br>

VI. No health maintenance organization shall, when issuing or renewing a policy or contract of insurance or any certificate under such policy or contract covered by this chapter, deny coverage or limit coverage to any resident of this state on the basis of health risk or condition except that a waiting period consistent with insurance department rules may be imposed for pre-existing medical conditions.  If a health maintenance organization accepts an application for group coverage, such acceptance shall be subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the group has coverage in effect through another plan, the health maintenance organization shall accept all persons covered under the existing plan.  If the group does not have coverage in effect through another plan, the health maintenance organization shall accept all persons for which the group seeks coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Once a group policy has been issued, any person becoming eligible for coverage shall become covered by enrolling within 31 days after first becoming eligible.  Any person so enrolling shall not be required to submit evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  If a person does not enroll at this time, he is a late enrollee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Once a group policy has been issued, the health maintenance organization shall provide the group with an annual open enrollment period for late enrollees.  During the open enrollment period, any late enrollee shall be permitted to enroll without submitting any evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  For late enrollees only, the pre-existing condition provisions shall apply for 18 months from the date of enrollment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. An insurer issuing policies of group insurance shall allocate the costs associated with maternity and childbirth over both males and females covered by its entire block of business in this state.  In cases in which, because of the amount written in the state, allocation to an entire block of business needs to occur, the carrier may apply for a waiver from the insurance commissioner.

<codesect>
Upon satisfactory evidence that any health maintenance organization has violated any law or regulation or in any way has failed in meeting its obligations, the commissioner may, in his discretion, pursue any one or more of the following courses of action:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Suspend the certificate of authority to operate as a health maintenance organization under this chapter.  When the certificate of authority is suspended, the organization shall not during the period of such suspension enroll any additional enrolled participants except newborn children or other newly acquired dependents of existing enrolled participants, and shall not engage in any advertising or solicitation whatever;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Revoke the certificate of authority to operate as a health maintenance organization under this chapter.  When the certificate of authority is revoked, such organization shall proceed under the supervision of the commissioner, immediately following the effective date of the order of revocation, to wind up its affairs, and shall conduct no further business except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of such organization.  It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation whatsoever.  The commissioner may, by written order, permit such further operation of the organization as he may find to be in the best interest of enrolled participants, to the end that enrolled participants will be afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Impose a penalty of not more than $2,500 for each and every unlawful act committed;  each violation shall constitute a separate fineable offense;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Issue an administrative order requiring the health maintenance organization:  to cease or modify inappropriate conduct or practices by it or any of the personnel employed or associated with it;  to fulfill its contractual obligations;  to provide a service which has been improperly denied;  or to take appropriate steps to restore the ability of the organization to provide a contracted-for service;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Apply to any court for such legal or equitable relief as the commissioner deems appropriate.

I. An insurance company licensed in this state, or a hospital, medical or health service corporation authorized to do business in this state, either directly or through a subsidiary or affiliate, may organize and operate a health maintenance organization under the provisions of this chapter.  An insurance company licensed in this state, or a hospital, medical or health services corporation shall obtain a certificate of authority pursuant to RSA 420-B:2 and shall comply with all of the provisions of this chapter with respect to its health maintenance organization activities.  Notwithstanding any other law which may be inconsistent herewith, any 2 or more such insurance companies, hospitals or medical service corporations, or subsidiaries or affiliates thereof, may jointly organize and operate a health maintenance organization.  The business of insurance is deemed to include the providing of health care services by a health maintenance organization owned or operated by an insurer or a subsidiary thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any provisions of the laws of this state relating to insurance corporations engaged in the business of insurance, or any provisions of RSA 420-A relating to health service corporations, an insurer or health service corporation may contract with a health maintenance organization to provide insurance or similar protection against the cost of care provided through health maintenance organizations and to provide coverage in the event of failure of the health maintenance organization to meet its obligations.  The enrolled participants of a health maintenance organization constitute a permissible group under such laws.  Under the contracts set forth in this paragraph, the insurer or health service corporation may make benefit payments to health maintenance organizations for health care services rendered by providers pursuant to the health care plan.

Where there is a prevailing collective bargaining agreement, the selection of the available health maintenance organizations shall be made pursuant to the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No employer in this state shall be required to pay more for health benefits as a result of the application of this section than would otherwise be required by any prevailing collective bargaining agreement or other contract for the provision of health benefits to its employees, provided that the employer or benefits fund shall pay to the health maintenance organization chosen by each employee or member an amount equal to the lesser of:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Before issuing a certificate of authority under this chapter, the commissioner shall require that the health maintenance organization have an initial net worth of $6,000,000 and that the minimum net worth required under paragraph II is maintained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every health maintenance organization shall maintain a minimum net worth equal to the greater of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) $6,000,000;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Seven and one-half percent of annual premium revenues as reported on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the commissioner.  The minimum net worth shall be met by the health maintenance organization upon expiration of the certificate of authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition to paragraphs I and II, if at any time uncovered expenditures exceed 15 percent of the total health care expenditures, a health maintenance organization shall increase the required minimum net worth by 120 percent of the health maintenance organization's outstanding liability for uncovered expenditures for enrollees including incurred but not reported claims which shall be calculated as of the first date of the month and retained for the remainder of the month.  The increase to minimum net worth required by this paragraph shall not exceed $5,000,000.  Health maintenance organizations shall file a report within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter with information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition to paragraphs I, II and III, the commissioner shall require additional capital if he finds that the health maintenance organization does not have reasonable and adequate specific stop-loss reinsurance for its individual members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Every health maintenance organization shall, when determining liabilities, include an amount estimated in the aggregate to provide for any unearned premium and for the payment of all claims for health care expenditures which have been incurred, whether reported or unreported, which are unpaid and for which such organization is or may be liable, and to provide for the expense of adjustment of settlement of such claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Such liabilities shall be computed in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner upon reasonable consideration of the ascertained experience and character of the health maintenance organization.
