&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-B:8-o Third-Party Payment of Covered, Court-Ordered Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The existence of a court order under RSA 169-B, RSA 169-C, or RSA 169-D for a service, program, or placement that is covered under any insurance for the minor shall not be considered in determining qualification for third-party payment under such insurance.  Benefits for such services shall be subject to the same dollar limits, deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance factors and to the terms and conditions of the policy or certificate, including any managed care provisions.  However, the claimant or claimant's representative shall have 48 hours from the commencement of a court-ordered service, placement, or program to seek any pre-authorization, pre-certification, or referral required under the terms of the policy.  The determination of these preservice claims for court-ordered services for a minor shall be made as soon as possible, taking into account the medical exigencies, but in no event later than 48 hours after receipt of the request and sufficient information, unless the claimant or claimant's representative fails to provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, benefits are covered or payable.  In the case of such failure, the insurer shall notify the claimant or claimant's representative within 24 hours of receipt of the request and shall advise the claimant or claimant's representative of the specific information necessary to determine to what extent benefits are covered or payable.  The claimant or claimant's representative shall be afforded a reasonable amount of time, taking into account the circumstances, but not less than 48 hours, to provide the specified information.  Thereafter, notification of the claim determination shall be made as soon as possible, but in no case later than 48 hours after the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The insurer's receipt of the specified additional information;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The end of the period afforded the claimant or claimant's representative to provide the specified additional information.
