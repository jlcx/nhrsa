&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408:16 Group Standard Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No policy or certificates of group life insurance or any form attached to a policy or certificate of group life insurance shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state to a resident of this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are more favorable to the persons insured, or at least as favorable to the persons insured and more favorable to the policyholder, or certificate holder, provided, however, (a) that provisions in paragraphs VI-X inclusive shall not apply to policies issued to a creditor to insure debtors of such creditor, or policies issued to a credit union to insure members of such credit union;  (b) that standard provisions which may be required for individual life insurance policies shall not apply to group life insurance policies;  and (c) that if the group life insurance policy is on a plan of insurance other than the term plan, it shall contain a nonforfeiture provision or provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner is or are equitable to the insured persons and to the policyholder or certificate holder, but nothing herein shall be construed to require that group life insurance policies and certificates contain the same nonforfeiture provisions as are required for individual life insurance policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A provision that the policyholder is entitled to a grace period of 31 days for the payment of any premium due except the first, during which grace period the death benefit coverage shall continue in force, unless the policyholder shall have given the insurer written notice of discontinuance in advance of the date of discontinuance and in accordance with the terms of the policy.  The policy may provide that the policyholder shall be liable to the insurer for the payment of a pro rata premium for the time the policy was in force during such grace period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A provision that the validity of the policy shall not be contested, except for nonpayment of premiums, after it has been in force for 2 years from its date of issue;  and that no statement made by any person insured under the policy relating to his insurability shall be used in contesting the validity of the insurance with respect to which such statement was made after such insurance has been in force prior to the contest for a period of 2 years during such person's lifetime nor unless it is contained in a written instrument signed by him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A provision that a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder shall be attached to the policy when issued, that all statements made by the policyholder or by the persons insured shall be deemed representations and not warranties, and that no statement made by any person insured shall be used in any contest unless a copy of the instrument containing the statement is or has been furnished to such person or to his beneficiary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A provision setting forth the conditions, if any, under which the insurer reserves the right to require a person eligible for insurance to furnish evidence of individual insurability satisfactory to the insurer as a condition to part or all of his coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A provision specifying an equitable adjustment of premiums or of benefits or of both to be made in the event the age of a person insured has been misstated, such provision to contain a clear statement of the method of adjustment to be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A provision that any sum becoming due by reason of the death of the person insured shall be payable to the beneficiary designated by the person insured, subject to the provisions of the policy in the event there is no designated beneficiary as to all or any part of such sum living at the death of the person insured, and subject to any right reserved by the insurer in the policy and set forth in the certificate to pay at its option a part of such sum not exceeding $250 to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto by reason of having incurred funeral or other expenses incident to the last illness or death of the person insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A provision that the insurer will issue to the policyholder for delivery to each person insured an individual certificate setting forth a statement as to the insurance protection to which he is entitled, to whom the insurance benefits are payable, and the rights and conditions set forth in paragraphs VIII, IX and X following.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A provision that if the insurance, or any portion of it, on a person covered under the policy ceases because of termination of employment or of membership in the class or classes eligible for coverage under the policy, such person shall be entitled to have issued to the person by the insurer, without evidence of insurability, an individual policy of life insurance without disability or other supplementary benefits, provided application for the individual policy shall be made, and the first premium paid to the insurer, within 31 days after such termination, and provided further that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The individual policy shall, at the option of such person, be on any one of the forms, except term insurance, then customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The individual policy shall be in an amount not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of such termination, provided that any amount of insurance which shall have matured on or before the date of such termination as an endowment payable to the person insured, whether in one sum or in installments in the form of an annuity, shall not, for the purposes of this provision, be included in the amount which is considered to cease because of such termination;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The premium on the individual policy shall be at the insurer's then customary rate applicable to the form and amount of the individual policy, to the class of risk to which such person then belongs, and to the person's age attained on the effective date of the individual policy;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The suicide provision of the individual policy shall no longer apply after the second anniversary of the effective date of the group life insurance from which the conversion was made;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The individual policy shall not be contestable after the second anniversary of the effective date of the group life insurance from which conversion was made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. A provision that if the group policy terminates or is amended so as to terminate the insurance of any class of insured persons, every person insured thereunder at the date of such termination whose insurance terminates and who has been so insured for at least 5 years prior to such termination date shall be entitled to have issued by the insurer an individual policy of life insurance, subject to the same conditions and limitations as are provided by paragraph VIII above, except that the group policy may provide that the amount of such individual policy shall not exceed the smaller of (a) the amount of the person's life insurance protection ceasing because of the termination or amendment of the group policy, less the amount of life insurance for which he or she is or becomes eligible under any group policy issued or reinstated by the same or another insurer within 31 days after such termination, and (b) $10,000.  Each insured person shall be given written notice of this conversion privilege and its duration within 15 days after the date of termination of the group contract or policy.  If this notice is given more than 15 days after the date of termination, the time allowed for the exercise of the privilege of conversion shall be extended for a period of 15 days following the date of the written notice.  Such notice shall be mailed by the insurer to the insured person at the last address furnished to the insurer by the policyholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A provision that if a person insured under the group policy dies during the period within which he would have been entitled to have an individual policy issued to him in accordance with paragraph VIII or IX above and before such an individual policy shall have become effective, the amount of life insurance which he would have been entitled to have issued to him under such individual policy shall be payable as a claim under the group policy, whether or not application for the individual policy or the payment of the first premium therefor has been made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Whenever any policy of group life insurance extends group life insurance to the spouse, child or children, or other dependents of an employee, or other member of the group, and if the coverage of any dependent of any employee or member of the group insured by such policy who is mentally or physically incapable of earning a living on the date as of which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another group policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as the dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the employee or member of the group or the employee or the employee's estate is chargeable for the care of the dependent, provided, that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon termination of such incapacity to a converted policy in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the conversion privilege clause if such privilege is afforded by the policy, provided that such dependent has not attained the limiting age, if any, for conversion of adults specified in the policy.
