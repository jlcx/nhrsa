&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408:15 Group Life Insurance;  Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No policy or certificate of group life insurance shall be issued or delivered in this state unless the policy is issued to a group that conforms to one of the following descriptions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A policy issued to an employer, or to the trustees of a fund established by an employer, which employer or trustees shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure employees of the employer for the benefit of persons other than the employer, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The employees eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the employees of the employer, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the employees of one or more subsidiary corporations and the employees, individual proprietors, and partners of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships if the business of the employer and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership, contract, or otherwise.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the individual proprietor or partners if the employer is an individual proprietor or a partnership.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include retired employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the employer's funds, or from funds contributed by the insured employees, or from both.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured employees must insure all eligible employees, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the employees or by the employer or trustees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A policy issued to a creditor or to the trustees of a fund established by one or more creditors, which creditor or trustees shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure debtors of the creditor or creditors, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The debtors eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all the debtors of the creditor or creditors whose indebtedness is repayable in installments, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to the indebtedness or to the purchase giving rise to the indebtedness.  The policy may provide that the term "debtors'' shall include the debtors of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the debtors of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships if the business of the policyholder and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership, contract, or otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the creditor or creditors' funds, or from charges collected from the insured debtors, or from both.  A policy on which part or all of the premium is to be derived from the collection from the insured debtors of identifiable charges not required of uninsured debtors shall not include, in the class or classes of debtors eligible for insurance, debtors under obligations outstanding at its date of issue without evidence of individual insurability unless at least 75 percent of the then eligible debtors of each creditor elect to pay the required charges.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from the collection of such identifiable charges must insure all eligible debtors, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policy may be issued only if the group of eligible debtors of each creditor is then receiving new entrants at the rate of at least 100 persons yearly, or may reasonably be expected to receive at least 100 new entrants during the first policy year, and only if the policy reserves to the insurer the right to require evidence of individual insurability if less than 75 percent of the new entrants become insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The amount of insurance on the life of any debtor shall at no time exceed the amount owed by him which is repayable in installments to his creditor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The insurance shall be payable to the policyholder.  Such payment shall reduce or extinguish the unpaid indebtedness of the debtor to the extent of such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A policy issued to a labor union, which shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure members of such union for the benefit of persons other than the union or any of its officials, representatives or agents, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the members of the union, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment, or to membership in the union, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either wholly from the union's funds, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for the insurance.  No policy may be issued on which the entire premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance.  A policy on which part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance may be placed in force only if at least 75 percent of the then eligible members, excluding any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer, elect to make the required contributions.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.

(c) The policy must cover at least 25 members at date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The persons eligible for insurance shall be all of the employees of the employers or all of the members of the unions, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment, or to membership in the unions, or to both.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the individual proprietor or partners if an employer is an individual proprietor or a partnership.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the trustees or their employees, or both, if their duties are principally connected with such trusteeship.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include retired employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premiums for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder either wholly from funds contributed by the employers of the insured persons or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policy must cover at least 100 persons at date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the insured persons or by the policyholder, employers, or unions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A policy issued to any non-profit industrial association (to be deemed the policyholder) in existence for a period of at least 10 years and organized for purposes other than obtaining insurance, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If 2 or more members of the association, or any class or classes of members thereof determined by conditions pertaining to insurance, elect to insure their employees or any class or classes of employees determined by conditions pertaining to employment;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The total number of insured employees must not be less than 100.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The insurance premiums are paid by such members to the association;  each member, insofar as applicable to his own employees, may collect part of the premium from insured employees;  and the method of apportionment of the premium payment between himself and his employees may be varied as among individual members;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Not less than 75 percent of the eligible employees of each participating member may be insured where the employees pay a part of the premium.  The word "employees'' as used in this subparagraph shall also include the individual members and employees of such association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the employees or by the members of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A policy issued to a credit union or to the trustees of a fund established by one or more credit unions, which credit union or trustees shall be deemed the policyholder to insure members of such credit union or credit unions for the benefit of persons other than the credit union or credit unions or trustees or any of their officials, subject to the following requirements:
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408:16 Group Standard Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No policy or certificates of group life insurance or any form attached to a policy or certificate of group life insurance shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state to a resident of this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are more favorable to the persons insured, or at least as favorable to the persons insured and more favorable to the policyholder, or certificate holder, provided, however, (a) that provisions in paragraphs VI-X inclusive shall not apply to policies issued to a creditor to insure debtors of such creditor, or policies issued to a credit union to insure members of such credit union;  (b) that standard provisions which may be required for individual life insurance policies shall not apply to group life insurance policies;  and (c) that if the group life insurance policy is on a plan of insurance other than the term plan, it shall contain a nonforfeiture provision or provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner is or are equitable to the insured persons and to the policyholder or certificate holder, but nothing herein shall be construed to require that group life insurance policies and certificates contain the same nonforfeiture provisions as are required for individual life insurance policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A provision that the policyholder is entitled to a grace period of 31 days for the payment of any premium due except the first, during which grace period the death benefit coverage shall continue in force, unless the policyholder shall have given the insurer written notice of discontinuance in advance of the date of discontinuance and in accordance with the terms of the policy.  The policy may provide that the policyholder shall be liable to the insurer for the payment of a pro rata premium for the time the policy was in force during such grace period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A provision that the validity of the policy shall not be contested, except for nonpayment of premiums, after it has been in force for 2 years from its date of issue;  and that no statement made by any person insured under the policy relating to his insurability shall be used in contesting the validity of the insurance with respect to which such statement was made after such insurance has been in force prior to the contest for a period of 2 years during such person's lifetime nor unless it is contained in a written instrument signed by him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A provision that a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder shall be attached to the policy when issued, that all statements made by the policyholder or by the persons insured shall be deemed representations and not warranties, and that no statement made by any person insured shall be used in any contest unless a copy of the instrument containing the statement is or has been furnished to such person or to his beneficiary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A provision setting forth the conditions, if any, under which the insurer reserves the right to require a person eligible for insurance to furnish evidence of individual insurability satisfactory to the insurer as a condition to part or all of his coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A provision specifying an equitable adjustment of premiums or of benefits or of both to be made in the event the age of a person insured has been misstated, such provision to contain a clear statement of the method of adjustment to be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A provision that any sum becoming due by reason of the death of the person insured shall be payable to the beneficiary designated by the person insured, subject to the provisions of the policy in the event there is no designated beneficiary as to all or any part of such sum living at the death of the person insured, and subject to any right reserved by the insurer in the policy and set forth in the certificate to pay at its option a part of such sum not exceeding $250 to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto by reason of having incurred funeral or other expenses incident to the last illness or death of the person insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A provision that the insurer will issue to the policyholder for delivery to each person insured an individual certificate setting forth a statement as to the insurance protection to which he is entitled, to whom the insurance benefits are payable, and the rights and conditions set forth in paragraphs VIII, IX and X following.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A provision that if the insurance, or any portion of it, on a person covered under the policy ceases because of termination of employment or of membership in the class or classes eligible for coverage under the policy, such person shall be entitled to have issued to the person by the insurer, without evidence of insurability, an individual policy of life insurance without disability or other supplementary benefits, provided application for the individual policy shall be made, and the first premium paid to the insurer, within 31 days after such termination, and provided further that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The individual policy shall, at the option of such person, be on any one of the forms, except term insurance, then customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The individual policy shall be in an amount not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of such termination, provided that any amount of insurance which shall have matured on or before the date of such termination as an endowment payable to the person insured, whether in one sum or in installments in the form of an annuity, shall not, for the purposes of this provision, be included in the amount which is considered to cease because of such termination;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The premium on the individual policy shall be at the insurer's then customary rate applicable to the form and amount of the individual policy, to the class of risk to which such person then belongs, and to the person's age attained on the effective date of the individual policy;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The suicide provision of the individual policy shall no longer apply after the second anniversary of the effective date of the group life insurance from which the conversion was made;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The individual policy shall not be contestable after the second anniversary of the effective date of the group life insurance from which conversion was made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. A provision that if the group policy terminates or is amended so as to terminate the insurance of any class of insured persons, every person insured thereunder at the date of such termination whose insurance terminates and who has been so insured for at least 5 years prior to such termination date shall be entitled to have issued by the insurer an individual policy of life insurance, subject to the same conditions and limitations as are provided by paragraph VIII above, except that the group policy may provide that the amount of such individual policy shall not exceed the smaller of (a) the amount of the person's life insurance protection ceasing because of the termination or amendment of the group policy, less the amount of life insurance for which he or she is or becomes eligible under any group policy issued or reinstated by the same or another insurer within 31 days after such termination, and (b) $10,000.  Each insured person shall be given written notice of this conversion privilege and its duration within 15 days after the date of termination of the group contract or policy.  If this notice is given more than 15 days after the date of termination, the time allowed for the exercise of the privilege of conversion shall be extended for a period of 15 days following the date of the written notice.  Such notice shall be mailed by the insurer to the insured person at the last address furnished to the insurer by the policyholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A provision that if a person insured under the group policy dies during the period within which he would have been entitled to have an individual policy issued to him in accordance with paragraph VIII or IX above and before such an individual policy shall have become effective, the amount of life insurance which he would have been entitled to have issued to him under such individual policy shall be payable as a claim under the group policy, whether or not application for the individual policy or the payment of the first premium therefor has been made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Whenever any policy of group life insurance extends group life insurance to the spouse, child or children, or other dependents of an employee, or other member of the group, and if the coverage of any dependent of any employee or member of the group insured by such policy who is mentally or physically incapable of earning a living on the date as of which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another group policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as the dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the employee or member of the group or the employee or the employee's estate is chargeable for the care of the dependent, provided, that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon termination of such incapacity to a converted policy in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the conversion privilege clause if such privilege is afforded by the policy, provided that such dependent has not attained the limiting age, if any, for conversion of adults specified in the policy.

<codesect>
Any employee whose compensation includes group life insurance, the premiums for which are paid in full or in part by an employer including the state of New Hampshire, its political subdivisions, or municipal corporations, or paid by payroll deduction, may pay the premiums as they become due directly to the policyholder whenever the employee's compensation is suspended or terminated directly or indirectly as the result of a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute for a period not exceeding 6 months and at the rate and coverages as the policy provides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. During said 6-month period, the policy may not be altered or changed, except that nothing in this section shall be deemed to impair the right of the insurer to make normal decreases or increases of the premium rate upon expiration and renewal of the policy, in accordance with the provisions of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When the employee's compensation is so suspended or terminated, the employee shall be notified immediately by the policyholder in writing, by mail addressed to the address last on record with the policyholder, that the employee may pay the premiums to the policyholder as they become due as provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The policyholder shall remit any premiums paid by the employees on a timely basis to the insurer.

IV. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the continuation of any such group coverage to any individual employee beyond the time that he takes full-time employment with another employer;  nor shall anything herein be deemed to require continuation of the group coverage more than 6 months after compensation is suspended or terminated as the result of a labor dispute, nor to require the insurer to continue coverage as to any employee for whose coverage premiums have not been remitted in accordance with the provisions of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. After said 6-month period, if the group insurance coverage is no longer available, then the employee shall have the right to convert to an individual policy in accordance with the provisions of RSA 408:16, IX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408:30 Separate Accounts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any domestic life insurance corporation which issues variable contracts shall establish one or more separate accounts known as variable contract accounts.  Any amounts received by the company which are required by the variable contracts to be applied to provide variable benefits shall be added to the appropriate variable contract account, and the assets of any such variable contract account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the company may conduct.  The company shall not, however, be a trustee with respect to such amounts.  If at any time there should be a deficit in any such variable contract account because of mortality experience, the company shall make additions to such an account, at least as often as annually, so that the assets of such account shall be sufficient to satisfy the company's mortality obligation for such variable benefits.  If at any time there should be a surplus in any such variable contract account because of mortality experience, the company may make withdrawals from such an account, not more frequently than annually, so that the assets of such account shall equal the amount required to satisfy the company's mortality obligation for such variable benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets may be made by a company between any of its variable contract accounts or between any other investment account and one or more of its variable contract accounts unless, in case of a transfer into a variable contract account, such transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the contracts with respect to the variable contract account to which the transfer is made, and unless such transfer, whether into or from a variable contract account, is made (a) by a transfer of cash, or (b) by a transfer of securities having a readily determinable market value, provided that such transfer of securities is approved by the commissioner.  The commissioner may approve other transfers among such accounts if, in his opinion, such transfers would not be inequitable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To the extent such company deems it necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state laws, such company, with respect to any variable contract account, including without limitation any variable contract account which is a management investment company or a unit investment trust, may provide for persons having an interest therein appropriate voting and other rights and special procedures for the conduct of business of such account, including without limitation special rights and procedures relating to investment policy, investment advisory services, selection of independent public accountants, and the selection of a committee, the members of which need not be otherwise affiliated with such company, to manage the business of such account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If and to the extent so provided under the applicable contracts, that portion of the assets of any such variable contract account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to such account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the company may conduct.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unless otherwise approved by the commissioner, assets allocated to a variable contract account shall be valued at their market value on the date of valuation, or if there is no readily available market, then as provided under the terms of the contract or the rules or other written agreement applicable to such variable contract account;  provided, that unless otherwise approved by the commissioner, the portion if any of the assets of such variable contract account equal to the company's reserve liability with regard to the guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in RSA 408:33 shall be valued in accordance with the rules otherwise applicable to the company's assets.
