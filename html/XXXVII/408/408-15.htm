&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408:15 Group Life Insurance;  Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No policy or certificate of group life insurance shall be issued or delivered in this state unless the policy is issued to a group that conforms to one of the following descriptions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A policy issued to an employer, or to the trustees of a fund established by an employer, which employer or trustees shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure employees of the employer for the benefit of persons other than the employer, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The employees eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the employees of the employer, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the employees of one or more subsidiary corporations and the employees, individual proprietors, and partners of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships if the business of the employer and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership, contract, or otherwise.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the individual proprietor or partners if the employer is an individual proprietor or a partnership.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include retired employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the employer's funds, or from funds contributed by the insured employees, or from both.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured employees must insure all eligible employees, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the employees or by the employer or trustees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A policy issued to a creditor or to the trustees of a fund established by one or more creditors, which creditor or trustees shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure debtors of the creditor or creditors, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The debtors eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all the debtors of the creditor or creditors whose indebtedness is repayable in installments, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to the indebtedness or to the purchase giving rise to the indebtedness.  The policy may provide that the term "debtors'' shall include the debtors of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the debtors of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships if the business of the policyholder and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership, contract, or otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the creditor or creditors' funds, or from charges collected from the insured debtors, or from both.  A policy on which part or all of the premium is to be derived from the collection from the insured debtors of identifiable charges not required of uninsured debtors shall not include, in the class or classes of debtors eligible for insurance, debtors under obligations outstanding at its date of issue without evidence of individual insurability unless at least 75 percent of the then eligible debtors of each creditor elect to pay the required charges.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from the collection of such identifiable charges must insure all eligible debtors, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policy may be issued only if the group of eligible debtors of each creditor is then receiving new entrants at the rate of at least 100 persons yearly, or may reasonably be expected to receive at least 100 new entrants during the first policy year, and only if the policy reserves to the insurer the right to require evidence of individual insurability if less than 75 percent of the new entrants become insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The amount of insurance on the life of any debtor shall at no time exceed the amount owed by him which is repayable in installments to his creditor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The insurance shall be payable to the policyholder.  Such payment shall reduce or extinguish the unpaid indebtedness of the debtor to the extent of such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A policy issued to a labor union, which shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure members of such union for the benefit of persons other than the union or any of its officials, representatives or agents, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the members of the union, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment, or to membership in the union, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either wholly from the union's funds, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for the insurance.  No policy may be issued on which the entire premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance.  A policy on which part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance may be placed in force only if at least 75 percent of the then eligible members, excluding any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer, elect to make the required contributions.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policy must cover at least 25 members at date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the union.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A policy issued to the trustees of a fund established by 2 or more employers in the same industry or by 2 or more labor unions, which trustees shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure employees of the employers or members of the unions for the benefit of persons other than the employers or the unions, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The persons eligible for insurance shall be all of the employees of the employers or all of the members of the unions, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment, or to membership in the unions, or to both.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the individual proprietor or partners if an employer is an individual proprietor or a partnership.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include the trustees or their employees, or both, if their duties are principally connected with such trusteeship.  The policy may provide that the term "employees'' shall include retired employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The premiums for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder either wholly from funds contributed by the employers of the insured persons or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policy must cover at least 100 persons at date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) The total number of insured employees must not be less than 100.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Not less than 75 percent of the eligible employees of each participating member may be insured where the employees pay a part of the premium.  The word "employees'' as used in this subparagraph shall also include the individual members and employees of such association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the employees or by the members of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A policy issued to a credit union or to the trustees of a fund established by one or more credit unions, which credit union or trustees shall be deemed the policyholder to insure members of such credit union or credit unions for the benefit of persons other than the credit union or credit unions or trustees or any of their officials, subject to the following requirements:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The policy must cover at least 25 members at date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
