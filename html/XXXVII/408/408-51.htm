If the commissioner is of the opinion that any such variable contract is of such a character that there is a serious financial danger to the purchaser in buying it, or that the circulars and advertisements do not disclose pertinent facts sufficient to enable intending purchasers to form a correct judgment of the nature and value of the variable contract, he may prohibit the registrant from selling or offering the said variable contracts, or in any way advertising the same.
