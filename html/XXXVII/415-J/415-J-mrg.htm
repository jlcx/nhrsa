<center><h3>Section 415-J:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-J:3 Coverage for Telemedicine Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the intent of the general court to recognize the application of telemedicine for covered services provided within the scope of practice of a physician or other health care provider as a method of delivery of medical care by which an individual shall receive medical services from a health care provider without in-person contact with the provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An insurer offering a health plan in this state may not deny coverage on the sole basis that the coverage is provided through telemedicine if the health care service would be covered if it were provided through in-person consultation between the covered person and a health care provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an insurer from providing coverage for only those services that are medically necessary and subject to the terms and conditions of the covered person's policy.
