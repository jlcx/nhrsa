If the commissioner of insurance finds after a hearing that, in any part of this state, automobile insurance, aviation insurance, property insurance, workers' compensation, accident and health insurance or any form of liability insurance is not readily available in the voluntary market, and that the public interest requires such availability, he may, by rule, either adopt plans to provide such insurance coverage for any risks in this state which are equitably entitled to but otherwise unable to obtain such coverage or he may call upon industry to prepare plans for his approval.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-C:15 Conclusion of the New Hampshire Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association's Business;  Issuance of Policies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the effective date of this section, the insurance commissioner shall bring a petition to the superior court for Merrimack county for the receivership of the New Hampshire medical malpractice joint underwriting association (NHMMJUA) pursuant to RSA 402-C.  The receivership of the NHMMJUA shall include the stabilization reserve fund trust established in 1986 to pay deficits of the association incurred as a result of policies issued prior to January 1, 1986.  Subject to such receivership, the NHMMJUA shall be a continuation of the same unincorporated association in existence immediately before the effective date of this section.  The NHMMJUA shall be an insurer organized in this state for purposes of RSA 402-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To facilitate the orderly resolution of the obligations of the NHMMJUA and transition of policyholders to coverage in the private market, the commissioner, as receiver shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Not cancel a NHMMJUA policy in effect upon his or her appointment as receiver unless the policyholder fails to comply with the terms of the policy, including the payment of premium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Not accept new applications for insurance for new policyholders after the effective date of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Renew any association policy in effect as of the effective date of this section, but shall not issue any NHMMJUA policy with an effective date after December 31, 2015, except that until December 31, 2015, the receiver may issue extended reporting coverage on policies issued before December 31, 2016.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Issue notice of nonrenewal in compliance with RSA 417-C to policyholders with renewal dates on or after January 1, 2016.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Upon the nonrenewal of any claims-made policy issued by the NHMMJUA that is in force as of the effective date of this section, calculate the amount of tail coverage premium collected, using reasonable actuarial methodologies and standards of practice, and return the tail coverage premium to the policyholder.  For the purpose of this subparagraph, "tail coverage premium'' shall mean that portion of the premium collected by the NHMMJUA and separately identified in NHMMJUA's financial statements, and which would have been used to provide tail coverage if tail coverage had been provided under the terms of the policy.  Return of the tail coverage premium shall only be provided to those claims-made policyholders who will not otherwise receive tail coverage under their claims-made policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The NHMMJUA shall have no in-force insurance business after December 31, 2016, other than extended reporting coverage elected under policies issued on or before December 31, 2015.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This section shall constitute a plan of complete liquidation for the NHMMJUA pursuant to section 331 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for federal income tax purposes effective on the effective date of this section.

<br><center>[RSA 404-C:16 repealed by 2015, 263:4, II, effective as provided by 2015, 263:5.]</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-C:16 Receivership of the Association. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The insurance commissioner, as receiver of the NHMMJUA, shall, consistent with this section, RSA 404-C:14, RSA 404-C:15, RSA 404-C:17, and the provisions of RSA 402-C wind-down its business, seeking to facilitate the payment of all policyholder coverage obligations in full and in the normal course of business.  The receiver shall make monthly reports to the court detailing progress made in the wind-down of the NHMMJUA, including expenses incurred.  Interested persons, including policyholders, shall have standing in the receivership and the right to be heard in reference to the monthly reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After the effective date of this section, the commissioner, as receiver, shall promptly seek competitive bids to have all of the coverage-related obligations under policies issued by the NHMMJUA assumed by an insurer or insurers.  At the earliest practicable date, the receiver shall then enter an agreement or agreements with an insurer or insurers to provide for the assumption and novation of all of the coverage-related obligations under policies issued by the NHMMJUA.  Any such assumption and novation agreement shall be subject to the approval of the supervising court after a hearing at which all interested persons, including policyholders, have standing and may be heard.  The assumption and novation agreement shall be on commercially reasonable terms and shall provide for continued protection for the NHMMJUA's policyholders against liability and expense in accordance with the coverage terms of their policies, as well as providing for established obligations to claimants under such policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 60 days of the initiation of the receivership, the receiver shall allocate a portion of the NHMMJUA surplus to establish a hardship fund in the amount of $2,000,000.  This fund shall be used for hardship claims by current NHMMJUA policyholders.  The hardship fund shall be available to provide grants payable directly to midwives certified under RSA 326-D and other health care providers who are licensed or approved by the state, who have in-force policies with the NHMMJUA as of the effective date of this section, and who can demonstrate by application to the receiver that they will suffer significant adverse economic hardship as a result of an increase of at least 25 percent in the cost of medical malpractice insurance coverage in the private market as compared to their coverage from the NHMMJUA as of the effective date of this section.  Any grant provided shall not exceed the difference between the cost of insurance through the NHMMJUA plus 25 percent and the premium charged in the private market for the most comparable coverage available.  The receiver's determination of grant eligibility shall be subject to court approval.  The hardship fund shall be administered until exhausted or until the termination of the receivership, whichever occurs first.  If funds remain in the hardship fund at the termination of the receivership, the receiver shall, with court approval, and before discharge of the receiver, transfer any remaining funds to a charitable organization that promotes aid to health care providers servicing medically underserved populations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon appointment of the commissioner as receiver of the association, no assessments of any kind shall thereafter be made by the receiver or ordered by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board members and officers of the NHMMJUA shall continue to be officers, trustees, officials, or employees of the state subject to RSA 99-D through the date of the rehabilitation order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Until liquidated, the NHMMJUA shall continue as a legally cognizable unincorporated association solely for the purpose of winding down the NHMMJUA, consistent with this chapter.  The provisions of this section and RSA 402-C shall control the management of claims and obligations of the association and shall supersede the provisions of administrative rules governing the operation of the NHMMJUA.

The interpleader into docket no. 217-2010-CV-00414 shall not prejudice the rights of any class of NHMMJUA policyholders with respect to those funds.  If any class of NHMMJUA policyholders cannot be represented or is barred from the old action, a new interpleader action shall be commenced to allow such policyholders to assert their claims with respect to the funds.

(a) The provisions of RSA 404-C:15-RSA 404-C:17 shall not alter, and shall not be construed to alter, any vested contractual rights that any class of NHMMJUA policyholders may have with respect to NHMMJUA assets.  The existence and extent of any such rights shall be determined by the interpleader court after termination of the receivership proceeding.  Funds that cannot be distributed to a policyholder in the interpleader proceeding referenced in this section due to the inability to locate the policyholder after reasonable efforts shall not be subject to RSA 471-C and shall be transferred to a fund within the treasury to be administered by the department of health and human services which shall utilize such undistributed funds to provide grants in aid to health care providers servicing medically underserved populations through the department's state loan repayment program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) There is established in the office of the state treasurer a nonlapsing fund to be known as the grants in aid to health care providers servicing medically underserved populations fund to be administered by the commissioner of the department of health and human services, which shall be kept distinct and separate from all other funds.  All moneys in the fund shall be continually appropriated to the commissioner of the department of health and human services, for the purposes of providing grants in aid to health care providers servicing medically underserved populations.
