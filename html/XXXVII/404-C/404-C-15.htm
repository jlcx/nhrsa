I. Upon the effective date of this section, the insurance commissioner shall bring a petition to the superior court for Merrimack county for the receivership of the New Hampshire medical malpractice joint underwriting association (NHMMJUA) pursuant to RSA 402-C.  The receivership of the NHMMJUA shall include the stabilization reserve fund trust established in 1986 to pay deficits of the association incurred as a result of policies issued prior to January 1, 1986.  Subject to such receivership, the NHMMJUA shall be a continuation of the same unincorporated association in existence immediately before the effective date of this section.  The NHMMJUA shall be an insurer organized in this state for purposes of RSA 402-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To facilitate the orderly resolution of the obligations of the NHMMJUA and transition of policyholders to coverage in the private market, the commissioner, as receiver shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Not cancel a NHMMJUA policy in effect upon his or her appointment as receiver unless the policyholder fails to comply with the terms of the policy, including the payment of premium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Not accept new applications for insurance for new policyholders after the effective date of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Renew any association policy in effect as of the effective date of this section, but shall not issue any NHMMJUA policy with an effective date after December 31, 2015, except that until December 31, 2015, the receiver may issue extended reporting coverage on policies issued before December 31, 2016.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Issue notice of nonrenewal in compliance with RSA 417-C to policyholders with renewal dates on or after January 1, 2016.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Upon the nonrenewal of any claims-made policy issued by the NHMMJUA that is in force as of the effective date of this section, calculate the amount of tail coverage premium collected, using reasonable actuarial methodologies and standards of practice, and return the tail coverage premium to the policyholder.  For the purpose of this subparagraph, "tail coverage premium'' shall mean that portion of the premium collected by the NHMMJUA and separately identified in NHMMJUA's financial statements, and which would have been used to provide tail coverage if tail coverage had been provided under the terms of the policy.  Return of the tail coverage premium shall only be provided to those claims-made policyholders who will not otherwise receive tail coverage under their claims-made policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The NHMMJUA shall have no in-force insurance business after December 31, 2016, other than extended reporting coverage elected under policies issued on or before December 31, 2015.
<br>
