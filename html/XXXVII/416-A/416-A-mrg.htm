IV. "Applicants for insurance'' shall be deemed to include all those whether or not a prospective insured, who from time to time apply to a title insurance company, or to its agent, for title insurance, and who at the time of such application are not agents for a title insurance company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Premium'' for title insurance is the amount charged by a title insurance company, agent for a title insurance company, or either of them, to an insured or an applicant for insurance for the assumption by the title insurance company of the risk created by the issuance of the title insurance policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Fee'' for title insurance means and includes the premium, abstracting, and/or searching charge, examination charge, and every other charge, exclusive of settlement, closing or escrow charges, whether denominated premium or otherwise, made by a title insurance company, agent of a title insurance company, to an insured or to an applicant for insurance, for any policy or contract for the issuance of title insurance, but the term "fee'' shall not include any charges paid to and retained by an attorney at law or abstracter acting as an independent contractor whether or not he is acting as an agent of a title insurance company or an approved attorney, or any charges made for special services not constituting title insurance, even though performed in connection with a title insurance policy or contract.

In lieu of those reserves required for other insurance companies, every domestic title insurance company, and every foreign or alien title insurance company which under the state of domicile is not required to maintain a substantially equivalent unearned premium reserve shall, in addition to other reserves, establish and maintain a reserve to be known as the "unearned premium reserve'' for title insurance, which shall, at all times and for all purposes, constitute the unearned portions of premiums due or received and shall be charged as a reserve liability of such title insurance company in determining its financial condition.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The unearned premium reserve of every title insurance company required to maintain such reserves in this state shall consist of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount of the unearned premium reserve held as of September 10, 1971, pursuant to law;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The amount of all additions required to be made to such reserve by this section, less the withdrawals therefrom as permitted by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every title insurance company shall add to its unearned premium reserve in respect to each title insurance policy, leasehold policy, contract, or reinsurance agreement issued by it, a sum equal to $1 for each such policy, contract, or agreement, plus $.15 for each $1,000 face amount of net retained liability on each such policy, contract, or reinsurance agreement, as defined in RSA 416-A:2, X, or the amount reinsured by it, and shall separately record the aggregate amounts so set aside and reserved in respect to such policies, contracts, or agreements written in each calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The amounts set aside as additions to the unearned premium reserve shall be deducted from income in determining net profits of any title insurance company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For the purposes of determining the amounts of the unearned premium reserve that may be withdrawn pursuant to paragraph V of this section, all policies, contracts of title insurance, or reinsurance agreements of title insurance shall be considered as dated July 1 in the year of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The aggregate of the amounts set aside in unearned premium reserve in any calendar year pursuant to paragraph II of this section shall be released from said reserve and restored to income pursuant to the following formula:   1/10 of said aggregate sum on July 1 of each of the 5 years next succeeding the year of addition to the reserve and  1/30 of said aggregate sum on July 1 of each succeeding year thereafter until the entire sum shall have been so released and restored to income.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The entire amount of the unearned premium reserve held as of September 10, 1971 pursuant to law shall be presumed to have been added to the reserve in the calendar year next preceding September 10, 1971 and shall be released from said reserve and restored to income under the formula set forth in paragraph V of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If substantially the entire outstanding liability under all policies, contracts of title insurance, and reinsurance agreements of any such title insurance company shall be reinsured, the value of the consideration received by a reinsuring title insurance company authorized to transact the business of title insurance in this state, shall constitute in its entirety, unearned portions of original premiums and shall be added to its unearned premium reserve, and shall be deemed, for recovery purposes, to have been provided for liabilities assumed during the year of such reinsurance.  The amount of such addition to the unearned premium reserve of such assuming title insurance company shall be not less than  2/3 of the amount of the unearned premium reserve required to be maintained by the ceding title insurance company at the time of such reinsurance.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each title insurance company, in addition to other reserves, shall at all times establish and maintain reserves against unpaid losses, and against loss expense, and shall calculate such reserves by making a careful estimate in each case of the loss and loss expense likely to be incurred, by reason of every claim presented, pursuant to notice from or on behalf of the policyholder, of a title defect in or lien or adverse claim against the title insured, that may result in a loss or cause expense to be incurred for the proper disposition of the claim.  The sums of the items so estimated shall be the total amounts of the reserves against unpaid losses and loss expenses of such title insurance company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amounts so estimated may be revised from time to time as circumstances warrant, but shall be redetermined at least once each year.

<codesect>
The net retained liability of any title insurance company under any single insurance risk as defined in RSA 416-A:2, IX and X, shall not exceed 50 percent of the net amount remaining after deducting from the sum of its capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve, and voluntary reserves, the value, if any, assigned in such summation to its title plant, all as shown in its most recent report on file with the commissioner.  The same limitation shall apply to any secondary risk assumed by means of reinsurance or to any policy of excess coinsurance except, whenever the primary retained liability of a ceding company shall equal or exceed 10 percent of the single insurance risk liability, the net retained or assumed liability limit of this section may be increased by an additional $250,000, but in no event above 100 percent of the net amount remaining after deducting from the sum of its capital and surplus, the value, if any, assigned in such summation to its title plant, all as shown by its most recent report on file with the commissioner.  Nothing in this section is intended to limit the amount of a single insurance risk, as defined in RSA 416-A:2, IX that may be written by a title insurance company;  but it shall cede to one or more other title reinsurers on or before the effective date of such writing, such portion or portions of the said risk as shall be sufficient to bring its net retained liability thereunder within the limits prescribed in this section;  and each such cession of risk shall be within the limits of this section as applied to the sum of the capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve, and voluntary reserves, less the value, if any, assigned in such summation to the title plants of the reinsuring company, as shown by its most recent report on file with the supervisory agency in the state of its domicile.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 416-A:13 Power to Reinsure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any title insurance company may cede reinsurance of all or any part of its liability under one or more of its policies, contracts, or reinsurance agreements of title insurance to any reinsurer which meets or exceeds the financial requirements of a title insurance company to do business in this state and is authorized to engage in the business of reinsurance of title insurance in this or any other state;  but, no larger amount of reinsurance shall be ceded to any reinsurer on a single policy or contract of title insurance, or on any single insurance risk as defined in RSA 416-A:2, IX, than such reinsurer would be permitted to retain if authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state.  Any title insurance company may also reinsure policies of title insurance issued by other insurance companies on risks located in this state or elsewhere.  Any domestic title insurance company or any foreign or alien title insurance company authorized to do business in this state shall pay to this state taxes required on all business taxable within this state and reinsured, as provided in this section, with any foreign or alien company not authorized to do business within this state.  Issuance of contracts of reinsurance by a reinsurer not authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state, but authorized to engage in the business of title insurance or in the business of reinsurance of title insurance in any of the United States, which contracts reinsure policies of title insurance issued by a title insurance company authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state on real property located in this state, shall not of itself constitute the doing of business in this state by such reinsurer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 416-A:14 Legal Investments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Title insurance companies shall comply with the investment requirements for other insurance companies, under the laws of this state, but, in addition, may invest in a title plant.  Such title plant shall be considered an asset at the fair value thereof.  In determining the fair value of a title plant, no value shall be attributed to furniture and fixtures.  The real estate in which the title plant is housed shall be considered an investment.  The value of title abstracts, title briefs, copies of conveyances or other documents, indices, and other records comprising the title plant shall be determined by considering the expenses incurred in obtaining them, the age thereof, the cost of replacements less depreciation, and all other relevant factors.  Once the value of a title plant shall have been so determined, such value may be increased only by the acquisition of another title plant by purchase, consolidation, or merger.  In no event shall the value of the title plant be increased by additions made thereto as part of the normal course of abstracting and insuring titles to real estate.  Subject to the limitations of this section and with the approval of the commissioner, a title insurance company may enter into agreements with one or more other title insurance companies authorized to do business in this state whereby such companies shall participate in the ownership, management, and control of a title plant to serve the needs of all such companies, or such companies may hold stock of a corporation owning and operating a title plant for such purposes.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
