&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 416-A:13 Power to Reinsure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any title insurance company may cede reinsurance of all or any part of its liability under one or more of its policies, contracts, or reinsurance agreements of title insurance to any reinsurer which meets or exceeds the financial requirements of a title insurance company to do business in this state and is authorized to engage in the business of reinsurance of title insurance in this or any other state;  but, no larger amount of reinsurance shall be ceded to any reinsurer on a single policy or contract of title insurance, or on any single insurance risk as defined in RSA 416-A:2, IX, than such reinsurer would be permitted to retain if authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state.  Any title insurance company may also reinsure policies of title insurance issued by other insurance companies on risks located in this state or elsewhere.  Any domestic title insurance company or any foreign or alien title insurance company authorized to do business in this state shall pay to this state taxes required on all business taxable within this state and reinsured, as provided in this section, with any foreign or alien company not authorized to do business within this state.  Issuance of contracts of reinsurance by a reinsurer not authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state, but authorized to engage in the business of title insurance or in the business of reinsurance of title insurance in any of the United States, which contracts reinsure policies of title insurance issued by a title insurance company authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state on real property located in this state, shall not of itself constitute the doing of business in this state by such reinsurer.
