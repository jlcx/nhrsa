<center><h3>Section 402:2</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 402:2 Contingent Liability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any mutual fire or casualty insurance company organized under the laws of this state, which charges a full cash premium, may limit the liability of policyholders to assessment by a stipulation in the policy, which shall have the same effect as a deposit note signed by the insured;  but such contingent liability of a member shall not be less than an amount equal to and in addition to the cash premium written in his policy.  Any such mutual fire insurance company, from and after May 20, 1941, and any such mutual casualty insurance company, from and after January 1, 1943, may issue nonassessable policies in this state upon compliance with the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall have and at all times maintain a surplus to policyholders as determined from its latest annual statement on file, which together with 30 percent of its unearned premium reserve is at least equal to the minimum capital required for the organization of a domestic stock insurance company to do the same kind or kinds of insurance.  Provided that this additional requirement shall not apply to those mutual fire or casualty companies organized under the laws of this state which are lawfully authorized to issue nonassessable policies in this state and are in fact issuing such nonassessable policies in this state on May 1, 1969.  Provided further that this additional requirement of surplus to policyholders may be reduced by the commissioner to a sum not less than the amount of the deposit required under paragraph II as to any domestic mutual fire or casualty company in existence on May 1, 1969, whenever the commissioner finds that such mutual company will, under the circumstances, be safe, reliable and entitled to confidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Mutual companies formed to do business under RSA 401:1, I and II, shall maintain a deposit with the insurance commissioner of $300,000 and mutual companies formed to do business under RSA 401:1, IV, V, VI or VII shall maintain a deposit with the insurance commissioner of $500,000 in cash or in securities which are legal investments for savings banks and in such other investments as may be approved by the insurance commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A mutual fire or casualty insurance company shall issue nonassessable policies only so long as it maintains these financial requirements and if it fails to maintain these requirements it shall not thereafter issue nonassessable policies in this state for one year from the time when its surplus, unearned premium reserve and deposit again meet the financial requirements of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every policy issued by any such company shall clearly state whether or not the holder of such policy is subject to liability for assessment.  Any policy issued by any such company which subjects the policyholder to liability for assessment shall contain a clear statement of the liability of the policyholder for the payment of his proportionate share of any deficiency or impairment as provided by law within the limit established by the policy, and shall further state that any assessment shall be for the exclusive benefit of holders of policies which provide for such contingent liability;  and the holders of such policies shall not be liable to assessment in an amount greater in proportion to the total deficiency than the ratio that the deficiency attributable to the assessable business bears to the total deficiency.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No insurer which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled in whole or in substantial part by any government or governmental agency shall be authorized to transact insurance in this state.  Membership in a mutual insurer or subscribership in a reciprocal insurer or ownership of stock in an insurer by the alien property custodian or similar official of the United States or ownership of stock or other security which does not have voting rights with respect to the management of the insurer or supervision of an insurer by public authority shall not be deemed to be an ownership or control of the insurer for the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall not grant or continue authority to transact insurance in this state as to any insurer or proposed insurer that management of which is found by the commissioner after investigation or upon reliable information to be incompetent or dishonest or untrustworthy or of unfavorable business repute or so lacking in insurance company managerial experience in operations of the kind proposed in this state as to make such operation, currently or prospectively, hazardous to or contrary to the best interests of, the insurance-buying or investing public of this state, or which the commissioner has good reason to believe is affiliated directly or indirectly through ownership, control, reinsurance transactions, or other business relations with any person or persons of unfavorable business repute or whose business operations are or have been marked, to the injury of insurers, stockholders, policyholders, creditors, or the public, by illegality, or by manipulation of assets or of accounts or of reinsurance or by bad faith.

I. On compliance with the foregoing conditions and if the company is found upon examination made by or under the direction of the commissioner to have complied with the laws of the state applicable to it, a license to transact the kind of business specified in the license shall be issued until June 14 thereafter.  Annually thereafter, on June 14, such license may be renewed so long as the company shall comply with the requirements of the law and the commissioner shall regard it as safe, reliable, and entitled to confidence, and so long as the company continues to conduct a meaningful insurance business, as determined by the commissioner, within New Hampshire.
<br>

(a) All insurance policies and contracts, and any endorsements or amendments separately issued and intended to be attached to such policies or contracts, shall identify the legal name, as set forth in paragraph II, of the insurer that is directly assuming the obligations under the policy or contract.  Inclusion of the legal name of the insurer in a policy jacket, declaration, or other similar cover page issued with the policy, contract, or endorsement shall be deemed to be in compliance with this requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Identification of the insuring company on any advertisement or promotional materials shall be governed by the laws or rules related to advertisements, misrepresentations in sale of insurance, and misrepresentation in insurance transactions.

III. No such domestic company shall subscribe to, or participate in, any underwriting of the purchase or sale of securities or property or enter into any agreement to withhold from sale any of its property, but the disposition of its property shall be at all times within the control of the board of directors.  Any agreement or contract providing for the lawful disposition of property wherein such disposition may be determined at the option of a third person at some specified future price or condition or specified time or upon demand shall be construed to be within the control of the board of directors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing contained in paragraph III shall prevent the board of directors of any such company from depositing any of its securities with a committee appointed for the purpose of protecting the interest of security holders or with authorities of any state or country where it is necessary to do so in order to secure permission to transact its appropriate business.  Nothing contained in this subdivision shall prevent the board of directors of such company from depositing securities as collateral for the securing of any bond or obligation required for the business of the company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All investments and deposits of the funds of a domestic company shall be made in its corporate name except that, subject to the approval of the commissioner, securities may be kept under a custodial or similar agreement with a bank or banking and trust company or registered investment advisor and issued in the name of a nominee of such bank or banking and trust company or registered investment advisor.

II. Securities as to which the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has not published valuation standards in its Valuation of Securities Manual, or its successor publication, shall be valued as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As obligations having a fixed term and rate shall, if not in default as to principal or interest, be valued as follows:  if purchased at par, at the par value;  if purchased at or below par, on the basis of the purchase price adjusted so as to bring the value to par at maturity and so as to yield in the meantime the effective rate of interest at which the purchase was made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Common, preferred, except sinking fund preferred stock valued under subparagraph (c), or guaranteed stocks, shall be valued at their market value or at the option of the company, they may be valued at purchase price if purchase price is less than market value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Sinking fund preferred stocks which are subject to mandatory redemption shall be valued at cost.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any investment that is not valued by standards published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners may be submitted by the company to the Securities Valuation Office for valuation, which valuation shall govern.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) No other investment shall be valued at more than its purchase price.  Purchase price for real property includes capitalized permanent improvements, less depreciation spread evenly over the life of the property or, at the option of the company, less depreciation computed on any basis permitted under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and regulations thereunder.  Such investments that have been affected by permanent declines in value shall be valued at not more than their market value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any investment, including real property, not purchased by a company, but acquired in satisfaction of a debt or otherwise shall be valued in accordance with the applicable procedures for that type of investment contained in this section.  For purposes of applying the valuation procedures, the purchase price shall be deemed to be the market value at the time the investment is acquired or in the case of any investment acquired in satisfaction of debt, the amount of the debt, including interest, taxes and expenses, whichever amount is less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The eligibility of an investment shall be determined as of the date of its making or acquisition or the date of commitment in the case of commitment to invest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 402:81 Insurance Premium Refunds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever an insurer owes a refund on an insurance premium paid, that insurer shall pay the refund within 30 days of the date when the refund becomes due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) When an insurance policy is cancelled by a named insured, a refund shall be due from the company or its appointed producer upon receipt of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The original policy to be cancelled;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A signed lost policy release;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A cancellation request from the insured which has been submitted in accordance with provisions of the policy or statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When an insurance policy is cancelled by an insurer, a refund shall become due upon the date of cancellation as stated in the notice of cancellation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For auditable policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Audits shall be completed promptly, no more than 120 days after the expiration or cancellation of the policy, provided that there is no bona fide dispute;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If there is no bona fide dispute, the refund of gross unearned premium shall become due on the date of the completed audit or 120 days after the expiration or cancellation of the policy, whichever occurs first.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any insurer that violates this subparagraph shall be subject to the penalty provisions of RSA 402:50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In cases where the amount of refund is in bona fide dispute, the refund shall not become due until the dispute is resolved and the audit is completed.  The insurer shall notify the insured in writing that there is a bona fide dispute and this notice shall toll the 120-day time period until the dispute is resolved.  Upon resolution of the dispute, the insurer shall proceed to complete the audit within the time remaining in the 120-day time period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A bona fide dispute includes the insured's failure to cooperate with the audit, provided the insurer has notified the insured of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The acts or omissions that constitute the insured's failure to cooperate;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The consequences of the insured's failure to cooperate, including delay in the completion of the audit and payment of any refund due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) This paragraph shall not apply to retrospectively rated policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) No refund shall be required if the return premium is $1 or less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the premium refunds described in paragraph I are refunded to an authorized third party, such as an insurance producer or a party with cancellation power of attorney from the insured, the authorized third party shall credit the premium refund for the account of the named insured.  In the event that crediting of return premiums to the account of the named insured results in a surplus over the amount owed the authorized third party by the named insured, the surplus shall be paid to the named insured within 10 days of receipt of the return premium, being credited to the third party, provided that no such refund shall be required if it amounts to less than $1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For any refund that is not paid to the named insured within the specified period set forth in paragraph I, the party to whom the premium is owed shall be entitled to interest beginning on the first day after the expiration of the period, at a rate determined by the state treasurer pursuant to RSA 336:1, II.  Any interest developed because of late refunding shall ultimately benefit only the named insured.  This paragraph shall not apply to retrospectively rated policies.

V. "Electronic signature'' shall have the same definition as under RSA 294-E:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
