&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 402:82  Claim Forms and Applications. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All insurance claim forms shall contain a statement that clearly states in substance the following:  "Any person who, with a purpose to injure, defraud, or deceive any insurance company, files a statement of claim containing any false, incomplete, or misleading information is subject to prosecution and punishment for insurance fraud, as provided in RSA 638:20.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No insurance company or producer shall accept an application for workers' compensation, property or casualty insurance, or life, accident and health insurance unless the application includes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A written or electronic signature of the producer, unless the transaction does not involve a producer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A written or electronic signature of the applicant.  In the case of group life, accident, or health insurance, the certificate holder insured under the group health policy is not the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Paragraph II shall not apply to a request for a binder providing temporary coverage, provided the binder is effective for a period of no more than 30 days.  The insurer shall comply with the provisions of paragraph II before the issuance of the insurance policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The lack of the information required by paragraphs I and II shall not constitute a defense against prosecution under RSA 638:20 or any other criminal statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Electronic signature'' shall have the same definition as under RSA 294-E:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Written signature'' means an original signature or a duplicate copy made by photocopying, facsimile, or other means similar and does not include stamped signatures.
