A company may lend funds, on a secured basis, to an employee to defray, in whole or in part, the expenses of such employee who has been transferred.  The maximum amount of any such loan to an employee shall be $250,000.  This section also shall not prohibit the taking of a secured mortgage by a company on real property serving as the residence of any of its officers, employees, or directors.  Such mortgage shall not exceed 85 percent of the appraised value of such realty as determined by an independent appraiser or the market value, whichever is the lesser amount.  One of the terms of such mortgage shall provide that the outstanding balance of the mortgage becomes immediately due and payable to the company upon termination of the employment, or officer or director relationship, between the company and the mortgagor, or upon termination of said person's ownership of said real property.
