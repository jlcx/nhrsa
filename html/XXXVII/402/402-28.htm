(B) Eighty percent of the fair market value of the real estate, if the mortgage loan requires immediate scheduled payment in periodic installments of principal and interest, has an amortization period of 30 years or less and periodic payments made no less frequently than annually.  Each periodic payment shall be sufficient to assure that at all times the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan shall not be greater than the outstanding principal balance that would be outstanding under a mortgage loan with the same original principal balance, with the same interest rate and requiring equal payments of principal and interest with the same frequency over the same amortization period.  Mortgage loans permitted under this subparagraph are permitted notwithstanding the fact that they provide for a payment of the principal balance prior to the end of the period of amortization of the loan.  For residential mortgage loans, the 80 percent limitation may be increased to 97 percent if acceptable private mortgage insurance has been obtained;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Seventy-five percent of the fair market value of the real estate for mortgage loans that do not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2).

(4) Subject to the limitations of RSA 402:29-d, I(a), credit lease transactions that do not qualify as rated securities under subparagraph (n) with the following characteristics shall be exempt from the provisions of subparagraph (1).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
