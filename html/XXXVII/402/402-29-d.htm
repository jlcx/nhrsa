<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The lesser of 10 percent of its admitted assets or 40 percent of its surplus as regards policyholders in the aggregate, except for an insurer whose insurance premiums and required statutory reserves for accident and health insurance constitute at least 95 percent of total premium considerations or total statutory required reserves, respectively, this limitation shall be increased to 15 percent of its admitted assets in the aggregate.
