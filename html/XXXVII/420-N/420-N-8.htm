&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-N:8 Federally-Facilitated Exchange;  Authority of the Commissioner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the event a federally-facilitated exchange is established for New Hampshire, the commissioner shall retain authority with respect to insurance products sold in New Hampshire on the federally-facilitated exchange to the maximum extent possible by law as provided in title XXXVII, including but not limited to producer and insurer licensing, form and rate approval, reinsurance and other risk-sharing mechanisms, network adequacy, industry assessments, internal grievance standards, external review, and unfair trade practices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who sells, solicits, or negotiates insurance within the meaning of RSA 402-J:3 through a federally-facilitated exchange shall be licensed as a producer under RSA 402-J;  provided, that nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the sale of health coverage by an exchange or health carrier directly to the consumer without the use of a producer.  This paragraph shall not be interpreted to require that all navigators as defined under the Act be licensed as producers, but rather that any individual who in fact performs a producer function be licensed, whether or not that person is employed by a navigator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may establish standards and training requirements for navigators on a federally-facilitated exchange consistent with section 1311(i) of the Act and regulations implemented under the Act, including provisions to ensure that any private or public entity that is selected as a navigator avoids conflicts of interest and is appropriately qualified to engage in navigator activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner shall, consistent with the requirements of the Act, allow producers to enroll individuals, employers, or employees in qualified health plans offered through a federally-facilitated exchange in this state, including enrollment using Internet websites.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A and in accordance with RSA 420-N:4, II, as necessary to perform the duties specified in this section and to protect against adverse selection by creating a level playing field between a federally-facilitated exchange and the commercial health insurance market.
