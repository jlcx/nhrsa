<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no creditor or lender shall require as a condition to closing a loan that the borrower provide an original insurance policy at said closing;  provided, however, that the creditor or lender may require the borrower to produce at closing a binder showing the borrower as a named insured and creditor or lender as mortgagee, and confirming that insurance has been issued, is in force, and will remain in full force until a copy of the final policy is delivered to the creditor or lender or until the creditor or lender has received notice of cancellation in accordance with the policy conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) No insurer may automatically write insurance on a debtor who has contracted credit based on the principle that the insurance is applicable unless specifically rejected by the debtor, unless the premium or such other identifiable charge as may be applicable is paid in full by the creditor.

(d) Failing to provide within this state reasonable means whereby any person aggrieved by the application of an insurer's rating system, claims practices, sales practices or underwriting procedures may be heard, in person or by an authorized representative, upon the person's written request to review the manner in which such procedures were applied in connection with insurance afforded or tendered to the person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. Conflict of Interest.  Failing to establish a reasonable procedure whereby insurance company officers, directors, trustees or responsible employees can disclose to the company board of directors or trustees any material interest or affiliation likely to conflict with their official duties.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (c), if the test results are positive or indeterminate and the individual tested has not given written consent authorizing a physician to receive the test results, such individual shall be urged, at the time the individual is informed of the positive or indeterminate test results, to contact the commissioner of the department of health and human services for appropriate counseling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A person who requires the test for the presence of an antibody or antigen to a human immunodeficiency virus shall maintain all test results and records pertaining to test results as confidential and protected against inadvertent or unwarranted intrusion.

<codesect>
Any person or entity regulated under title XXXVII which has reason to believe that an insurance fraud or insurance-related criminal activity has been committed shall make a report to the unit within 60 days or within a shorter period under such circumstances as the commissioner may prescribe by rule.  No waiver of any such regulated person's or entity's applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials or information shall occur as a result of such disclosure to the unit.
