<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no creditor or lender shall require as a condition to closing a loan that the borrower provide an original insurance policy at said closing;  provided, however, that the creditor or lender may require the borrower to produce at closing a binder showing the borrower as a named insured and creditor or lender as mortgagee, and confirming that insurance has been issued, is in force, and will remain in full force until a copy of the final policy is delivered to the creditor or lender or until the creditor or lender has received notice of cancellation in accordance with the policy conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No such insurance company, agent or adjuster shall engage in any act or practice of intimidation, coercion, threat, for or against any such insured person or entity to use such a particular company or location to provide such services or products.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nothing shall prohibit any insurance company, agent or adjuster from providing to such insured person or entity the name of an automobile glass company or automobile repair company with which arrangements may have been made with respect to automobile glass or repair prices or services.  If a name is provided, there must be disclosure by the insurance company, agent or adjuster to the insured person or entity that any other automobile glass company or automobile repair company or location may be used at the discretion of the insured person or entity.  However, the insurer may limit payment for such work based on the fair and reasonable price in the area by repair shops or facilities providing similar services with the usual and customary guarantees as to materials and workmanship.  If an independent repair shop or facility and an insurer are unable to agree on a price, then for the purposes of this section "fair and reasonable price'' shall mean the price available from a recognized, competent and conveniently located, independent repair shop or facility which is willing and able to repair the damaged automobile within a reasonable time.
