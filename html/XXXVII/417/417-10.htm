I. If after hearing or at the expiration of the period set forth in a show cause order issued pursuant to this chapter, any person is found to have violated RSA 417:3, the commissioner may suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew the license of that person.  The commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, in addition to or in lieu of such suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew, may impose upon that person an administrative penalty of not more than $2,500 for each method of competition, act, or practice found to be in violation of RSA 417:3.  The commissioner shall collect the amount so imposed and may bring an action in the name of the state to enforce collection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In lieu of the monetary penalties provided for under paragraph I, the commissioner, after hearing, may order relief for actual economic losses to restore, in whole or in part, any individual consumer, as opposed to a group or class of consumers, in interest to the position that the consumer formerly occupied either by the return of that which the consumer formerly had or by receipt of its equivalent in money.  Unless the parties agree, an order of relief under this paragraph shall not exceed $2,500 for each method of competition, act, or practice found to be in violation of RSA 417:3 and where a pattern of conduct or practice has been established.  Relief may be ordered under this paragraph only when the consumer in interest has agreed that such relief shall constitute a waiver of any action for the same cause that might otherwise be filed before an administrative agency or any court.  Relief ordered under this paragraph shall not apply to disputes regarding claims or losses.
