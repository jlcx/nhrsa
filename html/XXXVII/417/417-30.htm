&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except for insurance companies writing only credit, home warranty, travel, or title insurance, every insurance company licensed to write direct business in this state shall have antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, prosecute, and prevent fraudulent insurance acts, including a written antifraud plan submitted to the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Antifraud plans submitted to the commissioner shall be privileged and confidential and shall not be a public record and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in a civil or criminal action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of RSA 400-A:36, III shall apply to the furnishing of information by an insurer to the unit or to any other insurer involved in the prevention or detection of fraudulent insurance acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner finds that an insurer licensed to do business in New Hampshire has failed to submit a plan, as required under paragraph I of this section, reasonably calculated to detect, prosecute, and prevent fraudulent insurance acts, or has submitted but failed to execute that plan, the commissioner may issue a fine or suspend the right of the insurer to do business in this state until such time as that insurer comes into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
