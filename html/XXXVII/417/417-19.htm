&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417:19 Action Against Supplier. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a supplier, in any action or proceeding brought by the insurance commissioner, has been found to be in violation of this chapter or has been ordered to cease and desist, and said finding or order has become final, any consumer claiming to be adversely affected by the act or practice giving rise to such finding or order may bring suit against said supplier to recover any damages or loss suffered because of such action or practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the sole purpose of providing the consumer with the procedural rights set forth under RSA 541 and RSA 541-A, failure of the commissioner to take action under RSA 417:6 or RSA 417:12 within 120 days from the date of the receipt of a complaint from an alleged injured person shall constitute a finding that the alleged act or practice is not in violation of this chapter.  This finding may be appealed in accordance with RSA 541.  If upon appeal the decision of the commissioner is not upheld, the petitioner may proceed under RSA 417:19, I.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to pursue any legal or regulatory action pursuant to this chapter or any provision in title XXXVII.
