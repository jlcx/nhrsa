&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-J:17 Prior Authorization. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever substance use disorder services are a covered benefit under a health benefit plan subject to this chapter, no prior authorization shall be required for the first 2 routine outpatient visits of an episode of care by an individual for assessment and care with respect to a substance use disorder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever substance use disorder services are a covered benefit under a health benefit plan subject to this chapter, no prior authorization shall be required for short-term inpatient withdrawal management and clinical stabilization services for up to 24 hours, when prescribed by a clinician trained in the use and application of the ASAM criteria;  provided, that the facility notifies the patient's health carrier as soon as practicable after admission of the patient.  If the facility fails to notify the patient's health carrier as soon as practicable after admission of the patient, the facility shall be financially responsible for the costs of any services provided by the facility to the patient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Alternatively, a carrier may require prior authorization for the services described in paragraph II, but only if the carrier has a medical clinician or licensed alcohol and drug counselor available on a 24-hour hotline to make the medical necessity determination and assist with placement at the appropriate level of care, and the carrier provides a prior authorization decision as soon as practicable after receipt from the treating clinician of the clinical rationale consistent with the ASAM criteria, but in no event more than 6 hours of receiving such information;  provided that until such hotline determination is made, coverage for substance use disorder services shall be provided at an appropriate level of care consistent with the ASAM criteria, as defined in RSA 420-J:15, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If an insurance policy does not require prior authorization for short-term inpatient withdrawal management services or clinical stabilization services, paragraphs II and III shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require coverage for services provided by a non-participating provider.
