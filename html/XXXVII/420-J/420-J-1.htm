&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-J:1 Purpose and Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide standards for certain fundamental operations of licensed entities providing health insurance through a managed care system of health care delivery and reimbursement.  The establishment of these standards will ensure regulatory and quality consistency among the several and various licensees offering managed care type benefit plans and will enable consumers to make informed decisions in their relationships with managed care insurers.  This chapter is intended to apply only to those insurers offering managed care plans.  It is not intended to apply to traditional indemnity systems of reimbursement and fee-for-service forms of health care expense coverage.  Health insurers which do not significantly limit covered persons' choices of providers shall not be subject to this chapter.
