<codesect>
 A health benefit plan under this chapter offering chiropractic benefits shall provide benefits to a covered person who utilizes services of a chiropractic provider (doctor of chiropractic) by self-referral for 12 visits under the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless otherwise provided for by the health benefits plan, self-referral visits shall not apply to wellness care visits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A covered person may utilize the services of a doctor of chiropractic as defined in RSA 316-A, without discrimination relative to access and fees, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The health benefit plan shall fully disclose to the certificate holder in clear and understandable language the exact terms and conditions of each option that the certificate holder has purchased along with the co-payments or other cost-sharing features of each option.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 10 working days of the first visit or consultation, the doctor of chiropractic shall send to the health benefit plan, or its designee, the chiropractic case findings.  This shall be sufficient documentation for the initial 12 visits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. After 12 self-referral visits, a covered person who is continuing chiropractic care may be subject to utilization review from the health plan, or its designee, for the purpose of continued care.  A provider of the same specialty shall be consulted when making any utilization review determination under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the chiropractic provider recommends care beyond 12 visits, the participating doctor of chiropractic shall send to the insurer, or its designee, documentation containing information on the covered person's progress and necessity of care as well as a care plan for extended chiropractic care.  The care recommendation shall be deemed authorized if the health benefit plan does not respond to the care recommendation within 7 business days.  If the doctor of chiropractic fails to provide the required documentation, the insured or its covered person shall not be liable to the chiropractic provider for any unpaid fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The covered person shall retain the right to choose chiropractic care on an elective, self-pay, fee-for-service basis;  no entity regulated under this chapter shall prohibit a doctor of chiropractic from continuing care on an elective, self-pay, fee-for-service basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the health plan's ability to credential providers or structuring with network providers.
