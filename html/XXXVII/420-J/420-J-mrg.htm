&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-J:1 Purpose and Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide standards for certain fundamental operations of licensed entities providing health insurance through a managed care system of health care delivery and reimbursement.  The establishment of these standards will ensure regulatory and quality consistency among the several and various licensees offering managed care type benefit plans and will enable consumers to make informed decisions in their relationships with managed care insurers.  This chapter is intended to apply only to those insurers offering managed care plans.  It is not intended to apply to traditional indemnity systems of reimbursement and fee-for-service forms of health care expense coverage.  Health insurers which do not significantly limit covered persons' choices of providers shall not be subject to this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-J:5-e General Provisions Regarding External Review. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The health carrier against which a request for external review is filed shall pay the cost of the external review.  Except under the circumstances described below in this paragraph, such costs shall not exceed $1,500. The commissioner shall notify the independent review organizations of the cost limitation for conducting an external review.  The cost for an external review may exceed $1,500 if the commissioner determines an additional cost is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of the case in question.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The external review decision of the independent review organization shall be binding on the health carrier and shall be enforceable by the commissioner pursuant to the penalty provisions of RSA 420-J:14.  The external review decision of the independent review organization shall be binding on the covered person except to the extent the covered person has other remedies available under federal or state law.  The external review process shall not be considered an adjudicative proceeding within the meaning of RSA 541-A, and the external review decision of the independent review organization shall not be subject to rehearing and appeal pursuant to RSA 541.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An independent review organization shall maintain all standards of confidentiality.  The records and internal materials prepared for specific reviews by an independent review organization under this section shall be exempt from public disclosure under RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An external review organization acting in good faith shall have immunity from any civil or criminal liability or professional discipline as a result of acts or omissions with respect to any external review, unless the acts or omissions constitute willful and wanton misconduct.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The right to external review under this chapter shall not be construed to change the terms of coverage under a health benefit plan nor shall the health carrier retaliate against the covered person for exercising his or her right to an independent external review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When requested by the covered person, the commissioner shall provide consumer assistance in pursuing the internal grievance procedures under RSA 420-J:5 and the external review process under RSA 420-J:5-a-420-J:5-e.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner shall report annually to the governor and the legislature on the number of grievances subjected to external review, the number of decisions resolved wholly or partially in favor of the covered person, and the number of decisions resolved wholly or partially in favor of the health carrier.  Such reports shall also include a separate statement of the number of cases in which the external review was terminated as a result of a reversal by the health carrier of its adverse determination after the receipt of new or additional information from the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative and the number of cases in which the covered person and the health carrier agreed to resolve the dispute prior to a final determination by the independent review organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If, based on the evidence presented during the external review process, the commissioner determines that the health carrier's medical director, in the conduct of his or her duties, may have committed misconduct as set forth in RSA 329:17, VI, the commissioner shall document such findings and transmit them in a separate report to the board of medicine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-J:6 Utilization Review. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each health carrier which does not contract with a utilization review entity shall establish written procedures for carrying out its utilization review processes and shall file such procedures with the commissioner on or before April 1 of each year.  Such carriers shall conform to the standards of either the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission or the National Committee for Quality Assurances and are subject to all applicable rules issued pursuant to RSA 420-E:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The written procedures shall describe the categories of health care personnel that perform utilization review activities and whether or not such individuals are licensed in this state, and shall address at a minimum, second opinion programs;  prehospital admission certification;  preinpatient service eligibility certification;  and concurrent hospital review to determine appropriate length of stay;  as well as the process used by the health carrier to preserve confidentiality of medical information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notification of claim denial shall be made within the following time periods:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The determination of a claim involving urgent care shall be made as soon as possible, taking into account the medical exigencies, but in no event later than 72 hours after receipt of the claim, unless the claimant or claimant's representative fails to provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, benefits are covered or payable.  In the case of such failure, the licensee shall notify the claimant or claimant's representative within 24 hours of receipt of the claim and shall advise the claimant or claimant's representative of the specific information necessary to determine the claim.  The claimant or claimant's representative shall be afforded a reasonable amount of time, taking into account the circumstances, but not less than 48 hours, to provide the specified information.  Thereafter, notification of the benefit determination shall be made as soon as possible, but in no case later than 48 hours after the earlier of (1) the licensee's receipt of the specified additional information, or (2) the end of the period afforded the claimant or claimant's representative to provide the specified additional information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The determination of a claim involving urgent care and relating to the extension of an ongoing course of treatment and involving a question of medical necessity shall be made within 24 hours of receipt of the claim, provided that the claim is made at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the prescribed period of time or course of treatment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The determination of all other claims for preservice benefits shall be made within a reasonable time period appropriate to the medical circumstances, but in no event more than 15 days after receipt of the claim.  This period may be extended one time by the licensee for up to 15 days, provided that the licensee both determines that such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the licensee and notifies the claimant or claimant's representative, prior to the expiration of the initial 15-day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the licensee expects to render a decision.  If such an extension is necessary due to a failure of the claimant or claimant's representative to provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, benefits are covered as payable, the notice of extension shall specifically describe the required additional information needed, and the claimant or claimant's representative shall be given at least 45 days from receipt of the notice within which to provide the specified information.  Notification of the benefit determination following a request for additional information shall be made as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 days after the earlier of (1) the licensee's receipt of the specified additional information, or (2) the end of the period afforded the claimant or claimant's representative to provide the specified additional information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The determination of a post service claim shall be made within 30 days of the date of filing.  In the event the claimant fails to provide sufficient information to determine the claim, the carrier shall notify the claimant within 15 days as to what additional information is required to process the claim and the claimant shall be given at least 45 days to provide the required information.  The 30-day period for claim determination shall be tolled until such time as the claimant submits the required information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All contracts with utilization review entities shall be available to the commissioner upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Each health carrier that conducts utilization review shall employ a medical director who shall have responsibility for all utilization review techniques and methods and their administration and implementation.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a medical director from consulting with or relying on the advice of a physician licensed in this state or any other state.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating any civil liability to the medical director for the medical director's alleged negligent performance of the aforementioned responsibilities for utilization review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The clinical review criteria used by the health carrier or its designee utilization review entity shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Developed with input from appropriate actively practicing practitioners in the health carrier's service area;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Updated at least biennially and as new treatments, applications, and technologies emerge;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Developed in accordance with the standards of national accreditation entities;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The procedure a covered person must follow to obtain drugs and medications that are subject to a plan list or plan formulary.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every health benefit plan that provides prescription drug benefits shall maintain an expeditious exception process, not to exceed 48 hours, by which covered persons may obtain coverage for a medically necessary nonformulary prescription drug.  The exception process shall begin when the prescribing provider has provided the health benefit plan with the clinical rationale for the exception.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every health plan that provides prescription drug benefits shall notify covered persons affected by deletions to the plan list or plan formulary, provide an explanation of the exception process by which a covered person can access nonformulary medically necessary prescription drugs, and provide a toll-free telephone number through which a covered person can request additional information.  For purposes of this paragraph, covered persons affected by deletions to the plan list or plan formulary shall include those covered persons for whom the health plan has provided coverage for the deleted prescription drugs during the 12-month period immediately prior to the deletion.  Upon notification to covered persons, the health benefit plan shall allow at least 45 days before implementation of any formulary deletions;  provided, however, that advance notice shall not be required if the federal Food and Drug Administration has determined hat a prescription drug on the health benefit plan's formulary is unsafe.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every health benefit plan that provides prescription drug benefits shall maintain, as part of its records, all of the following information, which shall be made available to the commissioner upon request:  the complete drug formulary or formularies of the plan, if the plan maintains a formulary, including a list of the prescription drugs on the formulary of the plan by major therapeutic category with an indication of whether any drugs are preferred over the other drugs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. Every health benefit plan that provides prescription drug benefits shall provide notice of deletions to the plan list or plan formulary to all covered persons at least annually.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-b. Every health benefit plan that provides prescription drug coverage shall also provide notice of additions to the plan list or formulary to all covered persons at least annually.  However, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply to any health benefit plan that adds prescription drugs to its plan list or formulary upon approval by the federal Food and Drug Association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Every health benefit plan that provides coverage for prescription drugs or devices, or administers such a plan, or which contracts with an entity providing such prescription drug coverage, including but not limited to pharmacy benefit manager companies, shall issue to covered persons a card or other technology containing uniform prescription drug information.  The uniform prescription drug information card or technology shall include all of the fields required by the health insurance provider for claims processing in a clear, readable, and understandable manner on the card or other technology issued and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) The covered person's name and identification number.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All of the electronic transaction routing information required by the insurer or its benefit administrator in order for the pharmacy to electronically process a prescription claim, including but not limited to the BIN number labeled as such or the Processor Control Number labeled as such, or both.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All subscriber health insurance cards issued after January 1, 2004 shall contain the information required under paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A new uniform prescription drug information card, as required under paragraph V, shall be issued by health benefit plan upon enrollment of new members and when reissuing a new card to current members when there is a change in the covered person's pharmacy coverage that affects data contained on the card.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Every health benefit plan that provides prescription drug benefits shall allow its covered persons to purchase an up-to-90-day supply of covered prescription drugs on the covered person's health benefit plan formulary at one time, provided that the insured can demonstrate that such drug has been taken by the insured for a continuous period of one year and provided that such drug is not subject to the health benefit plan's utilization management, prior authorization, or pre-certification requirements.  Controlled substances as identified by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration are exempt from this paragraph.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the health benefit plan's ability to establish co-payments, coinsurance deductibles, or other member cost shares.  A pharmacy dispensing a 90-day supply of covered prescription drugs under this paragraph shall comply with any specified terms, conditions, and price which the health benefit plan may require for pharmacies that fill 90-day prescriptions.

I. Every contract between a health carrier and a participating provider shall set forth a hold harmless provision specifying protection for covered persons.  This provision shall include language substantially as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provider agrees that in no event, including but not limited to nonpayment by the health carrier or intermediary, insolvency of the health carrier or intermediary, or breach of this agreement, shall the provider bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek payment or reimbursement from, or have recourse against a covered person or a person acting on behalf of the covered person (other than the health carrier or intermediary) for services provided pursuant to this agreement.  This agreement does not prohibit the provider from collecting coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments, as specifically provided in the evidence of coverage, or fees for uncovered services delivered on a fee-for-service basis to covered persons.  Nor does this agreement prohibit a provider and a covered person from agreeing to continue services solely at the expense of the covered person, as long as the provider has clearly informed the covered person that the health carrier may not cover or continue to cover a specific service or services.  Except as provided in this chapter, this agreement does not prohibit the provider from pursuing any available legal remedy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provider further agrees that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) This provision shall survive the termination of this agreement regardless of the cause giving rise to termination and shall be construed to be for the benefit of the covered person;  and that
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) This provision supersedes any oral or written contrary agreement now existing or hereafter entered into between provider and covered person or persons acting on their behalf.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any modifications, additions or deletions to the provisions of this section shall become effective on a date no earlier than 15 business days after the commissioner has received written notice of such proposed changes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The execution of a contract by a health carrier shall not relieve the health carrier of its liability to any person with whom it has contracted for the provision of services, nor of its responsibility for the compliance with any law or rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The health carrier shall maintain provider and intermediary contracts at its principal place of business in this state, or the health carrier shall have access to all contracts and provide copies to facilitate regulatory review upon 15 business days prior written notice from the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No contract between a health carrier and a health care provider shall limit what information such health care provider may disclose to patients or to prospective patients regarding the provisions, terms, or requirements of the health carrier's products as they relate to the needs of such provider's patients except for trade secrets of significant competitive value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No contract shall use the term physician for the purpose of allowing a health carrier to avoid contracting with other health care professionals for health care services.  A physician shall mean a person licensed to practice medicine under RSA 329.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a health carrier to contract with a health care provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(c) The contracting entity may request that a health carrier disclose the fees applicable to specified procedure codes that pertain to the entity's practice or specialty or a method or process that allows the contracting entity to determine the fees pursuant to the terms of the contract.  Upon request by the contracting entity, the insurer shall furnish, in writing or in an electronic format, the requested procedure codes within 30 calendar days from receipt of the request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) No provider contract shall allow for a material change in the applicable fee schedule unless notice of such change is given at least 60 days in advance of the effective date.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Every contract between a health carrier and a participating provider shall provide that the health carrier may not remove a health care provider from its network or refuse to renew the health care provider with its network for participating in a covered person's internal grievance procedure or external review.

XI. Every contract entered into after July 1, 2003 between a health carrier and any physician or facility shall contain a provision that ensures that covered persons will have continued access to the provider in the event that the contract is terminated for any reason other than unprofessional behavior.  The continued access to providers shall be made available for 60 days from the date of termination of the contract and shall be provided and paid for in accordance with the terms and conditions of the covered person's health benefit plan and the prior contract between a health carrier and a health care provider.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. No health carrier shall interfere with a provider's right to legal representation during contract negotiations by restricting the provider's right to share confidential information with counsel or by refusing to negotiate directly with counsel selected by a provider as long as the provider receives assurance that counsel agrees to keep confidential the information exchanged during the course of negotiations to the same extent the provider is obligated to keep such information confidential.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Every contract or contract amendment entered into after the effective date of this paragraph between a health care carrier and any provider or facility shall contain a provision stating that no provider employed by a hospital or any affiliate is required or in any way obligated to refer patients to providers also employed or under contract with the hospital or any affiliate.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit health care carriers from providing coverage for only those services which are medically necessary and subject to the terms and conditions of the covered person's policy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-J:8-a Prompt Payment Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Health carriers issuing health benefit plans subject to this chapter shall pay claims submitted by health care providers for services rendered in New Hampshire to covered persons within 30 calendar days upon receipt of a clean non-electronic claim or 15 calendar days upon receipt of a clean electronic claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When the health carrier is denying or pending the claim, the carrier shall have 15 calendar days upon receipt of an electronic claim or 30 days upon receipt of a non-electronic claim to notify the health care provider or covered person of the reason for denying or pending the claim and what, if any, additional information is required to adjudicate the claim.  Upon the health carrier's receipt of the requested additional information, the health carrier shall adjudicate the claim within 45 calendar days.  If the required notice is not provided, the claim shall be treated as a clean claim and shall be adjudicated pursuant to subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Payment of a claim shall be considered to be made on the date a check was issued or electronically transferred.  The health carrier shall mail checks no later than 5 business days after the date a check was issued.  Failure to mail a check within 5 business days shall constitute a violation subject to enforcement under RSA 415:20.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The health carrier's failure to comply with the time limits in this section shall not have the effect of requiring coverage for an otherwise non-covered claim.  This section shall only apply to payments made on a claims basis and shall not apply to capitation or other forms of periodic payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Clean claim'' means a claim for payment of covered health care expenses that is submitted to a health carrier on the carrier's standard claim form using the most current published procedural codes, with all the required fields completed with correct and complete information in accordance with the carrier's published filing requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Electronic claim'' means the transmission of data for purposes of payment of covered health care services in an electronic data format specified by the health carrier and, if covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is in such form and substance as to be in compliance with such act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any initial clean claim submission not paid within the time periods specified in subparagraph I(a) shall be deemed overdue.  In that case:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The health carrier shall pay the health care provider or the insured person the amount of the overdue claim plus an interest payment of 1.5 percent per month beginning from the date the payment was due;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The health care provider may recover from the carrier, upon a judicial finding of bad faith, reasonable attorney's fees for advising and representing a health care provider in a successful action against a carrier for payment of the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Exceptions to the requirements of this section are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No health carrier shall be in violation of this section for a claim submitted by a health care provider if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Failure to comply is caused by a directive from a court or a federal or state agency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The health carrier is in liquidation or rehabilitation or is operating in compliance with a court-ordered plan of rehabilitation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The carrier's compliance is rendered impossible due to matters beyond the carrier's control which are not caused by such carrier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No health carrier shall be in violation of this section for any claim submitted more than 90 days after the service was rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No health carrier shall be in violation of this section while the claim is pending due to a fraud investigation that has been reported to a state or federal agency, or an internal or external review determination pursuant to RSA 420-J:5 or RSA 420-J:5-a-e.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may assess an administrative fine against any health carrier or may suspend or revoke the license or certificate of authority of any health carrier after determining that the health carrier has established a pattern of overdue payments and that the contemplated enforcement action would not promote the deterioration of the financial condition of an at-risk insurer.  Such fine shall not exceed $300,000 per calendar year examined.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to alter the commissioner's authority to investigate or take action, including, but not limited to, action pursuant to RSA 415:20, in response to individual instances of noncompliance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-J:8-b Retroactive Denials Prohibited;  Exceptions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "retroactive denial of a previously paid claim'' means any attempt by a health carrier to retroactively collect payments already made to a health care provider with respect to a claim by requiring repayment of such payments, reducing other payments currently owed to the provider, withholding or setting off against future payments, or reducing or affecting the future claim payments to the provider in any other manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The carrier has provided the reason for the retroactive denial in writing to the health care provider;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The time which has elapsed since the date of payment of the challenged claim does not exceed 18 months.  The retroactive denial of a previously paid claim may be permitted beyond 18 months from the date of payment only for the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The claim was submitted fraudulently;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The health care services identified in the claim were not delivered by the physician/provider;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The claim payment was for services covered by Title XVIII, Title XIX, or Title XXI of the Social Security Act;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The claim payment is the subject of an adjustment with a different insurer, administrator, or payor and such adjustment is not affected by a contractual relationship, association, or affiliation involving claims payment, processing, or pricing;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The claim payment is the subject of legal action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A health carrier shall notify a health care provider at least 15 days in advance of the imposition of any retroactive denials of previously paid claims.  The health care provider shall have 6 months from the date of notification under this paragraph to determine whether the insured has other appropriate insurance, which was in effect on the date of service.  Notwithstanding the contractual terms between the health carrier and provider, the health carrier shall allow for the submission of a claim that was previously denied by another insurer due to the insured's transfer or termination of coverage.

I. A policy may, at the election of the carrier, insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon application of an adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any 2 or more eligible members of that family, including husband, wife, dependent children, or any other person dependent upon the policyholder.  In the event a carrier elects to provide coverage for dependent children, the term "dependent child'' shall include a subscriber's child by blood or by law, who is under age 26.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The coverage of any family member insured by such policy, pursuant to paragraph I, who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his or her own living as of the date on which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as such dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the policyholder or the employee or his or her estate is chargeable for the care of such dependent;  provided, that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) The date upon which the employer under whose contract coverage is provided to a dependent ceases to provide coverage to the subscriber.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a health insurance carrier to refuse an election for coverage by a dependent pursuant to paragraph III, based upon the dependent's prior disqualification pursuant to subparagraph IV(a).

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Notice regarding coverage for a dependent as provided pursuant to this section shall be provided to a subscriber:
