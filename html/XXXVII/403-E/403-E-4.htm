&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 403-E:4 Failure to Comply. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The failure of a charitable organization to comply with the requirements imposed under RSA 403-E:3 of this chapter shall not prevent a charitable gift annuity that otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter from constituting a qualified charitable gift annuity.  The director shall enforce performance of RSA 403-E:3 by sending a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, demanding that the charitable organization comply with the requirements of RSA 403-E:3.  The director may fine the charitable organization in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per qualified charitable gift annuity agreement issued until such time as the charitable organization complies with RSA 403-E:3.
