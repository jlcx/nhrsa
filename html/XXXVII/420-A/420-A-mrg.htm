<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A statement of the period of grace which will be allowed the subscriber for making any payment due under the contract.  Such period shall be not less than 10 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Notwithstanding any provision of any policy of insurance issued under the provisions of this section, whenever such policy provides for reimbursement for any service which may be legally performed by a person licensed as an advanced practice registered nurse, reimbursement under such policy shall not be denied when such service is rendered by a person so licensed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. No health service corporation shall, when issuing or renewing a policy or contract of insurance or any certificate under such policy or contract covered by this chapter, deny coverage or limit coverage to any resident of this state on the basis of health risk or condition except that a waiting period consistent with insurance department rules may be imposed for pre-existing medical conditions.  If a health service corporation accepts an application for group coverage, such acceptance shall be subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the group has coverage in effect through another plan, the health service corporation shall accept all persons covered under the existing plan.  If the group does not have coverage in effect through another plan, the health service corporation shall accept all persons for which the group seeks coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Once a group policy has been issued, any person becoming eligible for coverage shall become covered by enrolling within 31 days after becoming eligible.  Any person so enrolling shall not be required to submit evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  If a person does not enroll at this time, such person is a late enrollee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Once a group policy has been issued, the health service corporation shall provide the group with an annual open enrollment period for late enrollees.  During the open enrollment period, any late enrollee shall be permitted to enroll without submitting any evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  For late enrollees only, the pre-existing condition provisions shall apply for 18 months from the date of enrollment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. An insurer issuing policies of group insurance shall allocate the costs associated with maternity and childbirth over both males and females covered by its entire block of business in this state.  In cases in which, because of the amount written in the state, allocation to an entire block of business needs to occur, the carrier may apply for a waiver from the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. A statement allowing subscribers with Medicare supplement insurance benefits a period of at least one year after the incurral of a covered expense within which the subscriber shall furnish any proof of loss required by the insurer.  Failure to furnish such proof within such time shall not invalidate or reduce any claim if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to furnish such proof and such proof was furnished as soon as was reasonably possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. A provision that such contract shall be signed by the president and secretary before it shall become effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. A statement that all benefits payable shall be paid to the participating providers except those in reimbursement of payments made by the subscriber to a non-participating provider and for which the corporation was liable at the time of payment.

In the event a carrier elects to provide coverage for dependent children, the term "dependent child'' shall include a subscriber's child by blood or by law, who is under age 26.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The coverage of any family member insured by such policy, pursuant to paragraph I, who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his or her own living as of the date on which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as such dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the policyholder or the employee or his or her estate is chargeable for the care of such dependent;  provided, that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Coverage for services provided to a dependent before the effective date of this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That an employer pay all or part of the cost of family coverage that includes a dependent as provided pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A subscriber that elects family coverage during any applicable open enrollment period may enroll any dependent eligible pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Coverage for a dependent provided pursuant to this section shall be provided until the earlier of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The dependent is disqualified for dependent status as set forth in paragraph I of this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When the health service corporation is denying or pending the claim, the corporation shall have 15 calendar days upon receipt of an electronic claim or 30 days upon receipt of a non-electronic claim to notify the health care provider or subscriber of the reason for denying or pending the claim and what, if any, additional information is required to adjudicate the claim.  Upon the health service corporation's receipt of the requested additional information, the health service corporation shall adjudicate the claim within 45 calendar days.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Payment of a claim shall be considered to be made on the date a check was issued or electronically transferred.

(d) The corporation's failure to comply with the time limits in this section shall not have the effect of requiring coverage for an otherwise non-covered claim.  This section shall only apply to payments made on a claims basis and shall not apply to capitation or other forms of periodic payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) "Electronic claim'' means the transmission of data for purposes of payment of covered health care services in an electronic data format specified by the corporation and, if covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is in such form and substance as to be in compliance with such act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any initial clean claim submission not paid within the time periods specified in subparagraph I(a) shall be deemed overdue.  In that case:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The health service corporation shall pay the health care provider or the insured person the amount of the overdue claim plus an interest payment of 1.5 percent per month beginning from the date the payment was due;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The health care provider may recover from the health service corporation, upon a judicial finding of bad faith, reasonable attorney's fees for advising and representing a health care provider in a successful action against an health service corporation for payment of the claim.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Exceptions to the requirements of this section are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) No health service corporation shall be in violation of this section for any claim submitted more than 90 days after the service was rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No health service corporation shall be in violation of this section while the claim is pending due to a fraud investigation that has been reported to a state or federal agency, or an internal or external review process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may assess an administrative fine against any health service corporation or may suspend or revoke the license or certificate of authority of any health service corporation after determining that the health service corporation has established a pattern of overdue payments and that the contemplated enforcement action would not promote the deterioration of the financial condition of an at-risk insurer.  Such fine shall not exceed $300,000 per calendar year examined.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The time which has lapsed since the date of payment of the challenged claim does not exceed 18 months.  The retroactive denial of a previously paid claim may be permitted beyond 18 months from the date of payment only for the following reasons:

(1) The claim was submitted fraudulently;

III. A health service corporation shall notify a health care provider at least 15 days in advance of the imposition of any retroactive denials of previously paid claims.  The health care provider shall have 6 months from the date of notification under this paragraph to determine whether the insured has other appropriate insurance, which was in effect on the date of service.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-A:22 Annual Review. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Annually, in the month of April, the commissioner may review the rates of every health service corporation, and shall, not later than 60 days after April 1 of each year, provided that the corporation has filed all pertinent data, make adjustments thereto, if any, as are just and reasonable.  Whenever the contingency reserve fund of a health service corporation shall be less than 8 percent of its annual premium income, the commissioner shall permit the corporation to charge rates designed to enable it to increase its contingency reserve fund by an amount equal to at least 2 percent of the annual premium income of the corporation.  If the liabilities of a health service corporation exceed its assets, however, the commissioner shall permit the corporation to charge rates designed to enable the corporation to accumulate such a reserve fund by an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the annual premium income of the corporation until such time as the assets of the corporation equal its liabilities.  In no event shall the commissioner permit a health service corporation to charge rates which would result in a reserve fund in excess of 20 percent of the annual premium volume of the corporation.  This section shall not preclude the granting of appropriate rate changes at any other times.  In connection with a rate decision, the commissioner may also make reasonable supplemental orders to the health service corporation and may attach reasonable conditions and limitations to such orders as the commissioner finds, on the basis of competent and substantial evidence, necessary to insure that benefits and services are provided at minimum cost under efficient and economical management of the corporation.
