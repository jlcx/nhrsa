<codesect>
An insurer may invest in common stocks of any solvent institution organized and existing under the laws of the United States or Canada, or of any state or province thereof, if such institution has had net earnings available for dividends on such stock in at least 5 of the 7 fiscal years next preceding acquisition by the insurer.  As used in this section the term "common stock'' includes transferable certificates of participation in business trusts.  An insurer may invest in or otherwise acquire and hold a limited partnership interest in any limited partnership formed pursuant to the laws of any state or the United States.  No limited partnership interest shall be acquired under this section if the cost thereof would exceed 2 percent of the assets of such insurer nor if such cost, plus the book value on the date of such acquisition of all limited partnership interests then held by such insurer and acquired under this section, would exceed 10 percent of such assets.
