<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Insurers shall invest in or lend their funds on the security of, and shall hold as invested assets, only eligible investments as prescribed in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any investment made or acquired by an insurer prior to July 1, 1978, which investment was permitted by statute at the time it was made, and which investment the insurer was legally entitled to possess on June 30, 1978, shall be deemed to be an eligible investment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any investment limitation based upon the amount of the insurer's assets or particular funds shall relate to such assets or funds as shown by the insurer's annual statement as of the December 31 next preceding the date of acquisition of the investment by the insurer, or as shown by a current financial statement resulting from merger of another insurer, bulk reinsurance, or change in capitalization.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 411-A:4 General Qualifications. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless specifically authorized by a provision of this chapter, no security investment shall be eligible for acquisition, unless it is interest bearing or interest accruing or entitled to dividends or is otherwise income earning, is not then in default in any respect, and the insurer is entitled to receive for its exclusive account and benefit the interest or income accruing thereon.  A debt security will be considered to be income earning where, although bearing no fixed or contingent interest, it is issued at a discount and contains a specific maturity date on which redemption is to be made at a stated value.  Stocks will be considered income earning although dividends are currently not being paid.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the acquisition by an insurer of warrants, options or similar rights to acquire securities if the acquisition of such securities would then be permitted by the provisions of this chapter (other than RSA 411-A:30);  or if such warrants, options or similar rights are acquired in connection with an investment otherwise permitted by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the acquisition by an insurer of other or additional securities or property if received as a dividend or as a lawful distribution of assets, or upon a debt or judgment, or under a lawful and bona fide agreement of bulk reinsurance, merger or consolidation, or if acquired by it through the exercise of warrants, options or similar rights to acquire securities received by it in accordance with this chapter.  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any insurer from entering into an agreement for the purpose of protecting the interests of the insurer in securities lawfully held by it, or for the purpose of reorganization of a corporation which issued securities so held, and from depositing such securities with a committee or depositaries appointed under such agreement, nor from accepting stock, bonds or other securities or other property which may be distributed pursuant to any such agreement, or to any plan of reorganization or arrangement;  and no provision of this chapter shall prevent any insurer from acquiring or holding any property acquired in satisfaction of any debt previously contracted, or that shall be obtained by sale or foreclosure of any security held by it.  Any security or property so acquired which is not otherwise an eligible investment under this chapter shall be disposed of pursuant to RSA 411-A:32 or 411-A:33.
