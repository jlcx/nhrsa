<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A full, complete, and accurate description of all offers, counter-offers, acceptances, and rejections relating to the proposed life settlement contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A written disclosure of any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the life settlement producer and any person making an offer in connection with the proposed life settlement contracts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-D:11 General Rules. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) A life settlement provider entering into a life settlement contract shall first obtain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the viator is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a life settlement contract;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A document in which the insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a licensed life settlement provider, life settlement producer, and the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 20 days after a viator executes documents necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within 20 days of entering any agreement, option, promise, or any other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate the policy, the life settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy.  The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by subparagraph (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The life settlement provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under subparagraph (a)(2), a copy of the viator's application for the life settlement contract, the notice required under subparagraph (b) and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life policy that is the subject of the life transaction.  The NAIC's form for verification of coverage shall be used unless another form is developed and approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a life settlement provider or life settlement producer or life insurance producer within 30 calendar days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud.  The insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on an NAIC form or any other form approved by the commissioner.  The insurer shall accept an original or facsimile or electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the viator.  Failure by the insurer to meet its obligations under this paragraph shall be a violation of RSA 408-D:12 and RSA 408-D:16.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Prior to or at the time of execution of the life settlement contract, the life settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the life settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the life settlement contract, that he or she has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that he or she is entering into the life settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A life settlement producer may perform any of the requirements of this section on behalf of the life settlement provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to confidentiality of medical information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All life settlement contracts entered into in this state shall provide the viator with an absolute right to rescind the life settlement contract before the earlier of 30 calendar days after the date upon which the life settlement contract is executed by all parties or 15 calendar days after the life settlement proceeds have been sent to the viator as provided in RSA 408-D:9, I(f).  Rescission by the viator may be conditioned upon the viator both giving notice and repaying to the life settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the life settlement provider in connection with or as a consequence of the life settlement contract.  If the insured dies during the rescission period, the life settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the life settlement provider or life settlement purchaser of all life settlement proceeds, and any premiums, loans, and loan interest that have been paid by the life settlement provider or life settlement purchaser, which shall be paid within 60 calendar days of the death of the insured.  In the event of any rescission, if the life settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a life settlement producer in connection with the rescinded transaction, the life settlement producer shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the life settlement provider within 5 business days following receipt of written demand from the life settlement provider, which demand shall be accompanied by either the viator's notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the viator, or notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the applicable rescission period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The life settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment, or change in beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Within 3 business days after the date the escrow agent receives the document, (or from the date the life settlement provider receives the documents), if the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the life settlement provider, the life settlement provider shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the life settlement into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally-chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment, or change in beneficiary forms to the life settlement provider or related provider trust or other designated representative of the life settlement provider.  Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the life settlement contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to RSA 408-D:9, I(f) renders the life settlement contact voidable by the viator for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator.  Funds shall be deemed sent by a life settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator via United States Postal Service or other nationally recognized delivery service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the life settlement provider or life settlement producer after the life settlement has occurred shall only be made by the life settlement provider or life settlement producer licensed in this state or its authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every 3 months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once a month for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or less.  The life settlement provider or life settlement producer shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the life settlement contract is entered into.  The limitations set forth in this subsection shall not apply to any contacts with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status.  Life settlement providers and life settlement producers shall be responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives.

<center><h3>Section 408-D:13</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-D:13 Advertising for Life Settlements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of life settlements and to assure the clear, truthful, and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of any life settlement contract.  This purpose is intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of life settlements to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of life settlements through the advertising media and material used by life settlement licensees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section shall apply to any advertising of life settlement contracts, or related products or services intended for dissemination in this state, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state.  Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every life settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products and services.  All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed, or presented, shall be the responsibility of the life settlement licensees, as well as the individual who created or presented the advertisement.  A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the life settlement licensee who disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of any advertisements not furnished by the life settlement licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication.  The form and content of an advertisement of a life settlement contract shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception.  It shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive.  Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The information required to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable, or state or federal tax consequence.  The fact that the life settlement contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied, or that the life settlement contract includes a "free look'' period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or improper practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The words "free,'' "no cost,'' "without cost,'' "no additional cost,'' "at no cost,'' or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true.  An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or service or may state that a charge is included in the payment or use other appropriate language.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Testimonials, appraisals, or analysis used in advertisements must be genuine;  represent the current opinion of the author;  be applicable to the life settlement contract, if any;  and be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement.  In using testimonials, appraisals, or analysis, a licensee under this chapter makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An advertisement shall not state or imply that a life settlement contract benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the life settlement licensee is disclosed.  If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled or managed by the life settlement licensee, or receives any payment or other consideration from the life settlement licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a life settlement contract all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of 5 years after its use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts.  The source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be identified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. An advertisement shall not disparage insurers, life settlement providers, life settlement producers, life settlement investment agents, insurance producers, policies, services or methods of marketing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The name of the life settlement licensee shall be clearly identified in all advertisements about the licensee or its life settlement contract, products, or services, and if any specific life settlement contract is advertised, the life settlement contract shall be identified either by form number or some other appropriate description.  If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the life settlement provider shall be shown on the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of the parent company of a life settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the life settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name of the life settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identify of the life settlement licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the life settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a life settlement contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. An advertisement may state that a life settlement licensee is licensed in the state where the advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that competing life settlement licensee may not be so licensed.  The advertisement may ask the audience to consult the licensee's web site or contact the insurance department to find out if the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the life settlement provider or life settlement producer is licensed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. An advertisement shall not create the impression that the life settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its claims or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its life settlement contracts are recommended or endorsed by any government entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its advertisements.  An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. An advertisement shall not directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the U.S. government endorses, approves, or favors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any life settlement licensee or its business practices or methods of operation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The merits, desirability or advisability, of any life settlement contract;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any life settlement contract;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any life insurance policy or life insurance company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will occur, the advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed application to the date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. If the advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the licensee during the past 6 months.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person furnishing information as identified in subparagraph (a) shall be entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs if he or she is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of this chapter and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so.  For purposes of this section a proceeding is "substantially justified'' if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it was initiated.  However, such an award does not apply to any person furnishing information concerning his or her own fraudulent life settlement acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) This section does not abrogate or modify common law or statutory privileges or immunities enjoyed by a person described in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Confidentiality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The documents and evidence provided pursuant to paragraph IV or obtained by the commissioner in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent life settlement acts shall be privileged and confidential and shall not be a public record under RSA 91-A and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in a civil or criminal action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subparagraph (a) shall not prohibit release by the commissioner of documents and evidence obtained in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent life settlement acts:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In administrative or judicial proceedings to enforce laws administered by the commissioner;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) To federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory agencies, to an organization established for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraudulent life settlement acts or to the NAIC.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Release of documents and evidence under subparagraph (b) shall not abrogate or modify the privilege granted in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Other law enforcement or regulatory authority.  This act shall not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of other law enforcement or regulatory agencies to investigate, examine and prosecute suspected violations of law;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prevent or prohibit a person from disclosing voluntarily information concerning life settlement fraud to a law enforcement or regulatory agency other than the insurance department;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Limit the powers granted elsewhere by the laws of this state to the commissioner or an insurance fraud unit to investigate and examine possible violations of law and to take appropriate action against wrongdoers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Life settlement antifraud initiatives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Life settlement providers and life settlement producers shall have in place antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, prosecute, and prevent fraudulent life settlement acts.  At the discretion of the commissioner, the commissioner may order, or a licensee may request and the commissioner may grant, such modifications of the following required initiatives as necessary to ensure an effective antifraud program.  The modifications may be more or less restrictive than the required initiatives so long as the modifications may reasonably be expected to accomplish the purpose of this section.  Antifraud initiatives shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Fraud investigators, who may be life settlement provider or life settlement producer employees or independent contractors;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An antifraud plan, which shall be submitted to the commissioner.  The antifraud plan shall include, but not be limited to:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) A description of the procedures for reporting possible fraudulent life settlement acts to the commissioner;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Antifraud plans submitted to the commissioner shall be privileged and confidential and shall not be a public record under RSA 91-A and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in a civil or criminal action.
