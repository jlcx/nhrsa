The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the life settlement provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the life settlement provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the life settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the owner or insured's certification described in and the independent evidence required by subparagraph I(c) when the life settlement provider submits a requests to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy or certificate to the life settlement provider, the copy shall be deemed to conclusively establish that the life settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section and the insurer shall timely respond to the request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No insurer may, as a condition of responding to a request for verification of coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant to a life settlement contract, require that the viator, insured, life settlement provider or life settlement producer sign any forms, disclosures, consent, or waiver form that has not been expressly approved by the commissioner for use in connection with life settlement contracts in this state.

The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause a viator to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a violation of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. No life insurance producer, insurance company, life settlement producer, or life settlement provider shall make any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy.
