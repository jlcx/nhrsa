(a)(1) The commissioner may conduct an examination under this chapter of a licensee as often as the commissioner in his or her discretion deems appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In scheduling and determining the nature, scope, and frequency of the examinations, the commissioner may consider such matters as consumer complaints, results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, report of independent certified public accountants, and other relevant criteria as determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of completing an examination of a licensee under this chapter, the commissioner may examine or investigate any person, or the business of any person, in so far as the examination or investigation is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the examination of the licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In lieu of an examination under this chapter of any foreign or alien licensee licensed in this state, the commissioner may, at the commissioner's discretion, accept an examination report on the licensee as prepared by the commissioner for the licensee's state of domicile or port-of-entry state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) As far as practical, the examination of a foreign or alien licensee shall be made in cooperation with the insurance supervisory officials of other states in which the licensee transacts business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Record retention requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A person required to be licensed by this chapter shall for 5 years retain copies of all:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Proposed, offered, or executed contracts, purchase agreements, underwriting documents, policy forms, and applications from the date of the proposal, offer, or execution of the contract or purchase agreement, whichever is later;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) All checks, drafts, or other evidence and documentation related to the payment, transfer, deposit or release of funds from the date of the transaction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) All other records and documents related to the requirements of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This paragraph shall not relieve a person of the obligation to produce these documents to the commissioner after the retention period has expired if the person has retained the documents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Records required to be retained by this section shall be legible and complete and may be retained in paper, photograph, microprocess, magnetic, mechanical, or electronic media, or by any process that accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for the reproduction of a record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Conduct of examinations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the commissioner shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination.  In conducting the examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the Examiners Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).  The commissioner may also employ such other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Every licensee or person from whom information is sought, its officers, directors, and agents shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient, and free access at all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, assets, and computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of the licensee being examined.  The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the licensee or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so.  The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of, any license or authority held by the licensee to engage in the life settlement business or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction.  Any proceedings for suspension, revocation, or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to Title XXXVII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner may issue subpoenas, administer oaths, and examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination.  Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When making an examination under this chapter, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state.  Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or licensee workpapers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the commissioner may, in his or her sole discretion, deem appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Examination reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Examination reports shall be comprised of only facts appearing upon the books, records, or other documents of the licensee, its agents, or other persons examined, or as ascertained from the testimony of its officers or agents or other persons examined concerning its affairs, and such conclusions and recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted from the facts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No later than 60 days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath.  Upon receipt of the verified report, the commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee examined, together with a notice that shall afford the licensee examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than 30 days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the event the commissioner determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of an examination, the commissioner may initiate any proceedings or actions provided by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Confidentiality of examination information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all examination reports, working papers, recorded information, documents, and copies thereof produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination made under this chapter, or in the course of analysis or investigation by the commissioner of the financial condition or market conduct of a licensee shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to RSA 91-A, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action.

(2) Disclosed to the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries under subparagraph V(e) by a commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) May share documents, materials or other information, including the confidential and privileged documents, materials or information subject to this paragraph, with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, with the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and with state, federal and international law enforcement authorities, provided that the recipient agrees to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the document, material, communication, or other information;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) May receive documents, materials, communications, or information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, from the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and from regulatory and law enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, material, or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material, or information;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) May enter into agreements governing sharing and use of information consistent with this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A privilege established under the law of any state or jurisdiction that is substantially similar to the privilege established under this paragraph shall be available and enforced in any proceeding in, and in any court of, this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter relating thereto, to the commissioner of any other state or country, or to law enforcement officials of this or any other state or agency of the federal government at any time or to the NAIC, so long as such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Conflict of interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An examiner may not be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest, or is affiliated with the management of, or owns a pecuniary interest in, any person subject to examination under this chapter.  This section shall not be construed to automatically preclude an examiner from being:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) No cause of action shall arise, nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of communicating or delivering information or data to the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative or examiner pursuant to an examination made under this chapter, if the act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive.  This paragraph does not abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

For purposes of this paragraph, a proceeding is "substantially justified'' if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it was initiated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
