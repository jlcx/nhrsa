This section shall apply to any advertising of life settlement contracts, or related products or services intended for dissemination in this state, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state.

An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX.

The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its advertisements.  An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-D:13 Advertising for Life Settlements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of life settlements and to assure the clear, truthful, and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of any life settlement contract.  This purpose is intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of life settlements to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of life settlements through the advertising media and material used by life settlement licensees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section shall apply to any advertising of life settlement contracts, or related products or services intended for dissemination in this state, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state.  Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every life settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products and services.  All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed, or presented, shall be the responsibility of the life settlement licensees, as well as the individual who created or presented the advertisement.  A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the life settlement licensee who disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of any advertisements not furnished by the life settlement licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication.  The form and content of an advertisement of a life settlement contract shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception.  It shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive.  Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The information required to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.

(a) An advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable, or state or federal tax consequence.  The fact that the life settlement contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied, or that the life settlement contract includes a "free look'' period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In using testimonials, appraisals, or analysis, a licensee under this chapter makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An advertisement shall not state or imply that a life settlement contract benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the life settlement licensee is disclosed.  If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled or managed by the life settlement licensee, or receives any payment or other consideration from the life settlement licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a life settlement contract all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of 5 years after its use.

If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the life settlement provider shall be shown on the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of the parent company of a life settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the life settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name of the life settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identify of the life settlement licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the life settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a life settlement contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its advertisements.  An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. An advertisement shall not directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the U.S. government endorses, approves, or favors:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any life settlement licensee or its business practices or methods of operation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
