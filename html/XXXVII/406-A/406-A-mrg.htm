The purpose of this chapter is to subject to the jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner of this state and to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state insurers not authorized to transact business in this state which place in or send into this state any false advertising designed to induce residents of this state to purchase insurance from insurers not authorized to transact business in this state.

II. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed.
