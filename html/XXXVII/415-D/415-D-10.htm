<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, a long-term care insurance policy shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the policyholder or certificate holder has been offered the option of purchasing a policy or certificate including a nonforfeiture benefit.  The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy.  In the event the policyholder or certificate holder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that shall be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a group long-term care insurance policy is issued, the offer required in paragraph I shall be made to the group policyholder.  However, if the policy is issued as group long-term care insurance as defined in RSA 415-D:3, IV(d), other than to a continuing care retirement community or other similar entity, the offering shall be made to each proposed certificate holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall promulgate regulations specifying the type or types of nonforfeiture benefits to be offered as part of long-term care insurance policies and certificates, the standards for nonforfeiture benefits, and the rules regarding contingent benefit upon lapse, including a determination of the specified period of time during which a contingent benefit upon lapse will be available and the substantial premium rate increase that triggers a contingent benefit upon lapse as described in paragraph I.
