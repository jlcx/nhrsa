&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-D:6 Cancellation of Insurance;  Conversion. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An individual long-term care insurance policy shall not be cancelled, refused renewal, or otherwise terminated by the insurer, except where the required premium has not been paid by or on behalf of the insured;  however, this shall not restrict or limit the insurer's right to rescind or revise a policy in the event of fraud or misrepresentation during the contestable period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a group policy is cancelled, refused renewal or terminated by either the insurer or the policyholder, each certificate holder shall be entitled to have issued to him or her an individual policy or replacement group certificate of insurance providing benefits equivalent to those enjoyed by the certificate holder under the group policy from which conversion is made.  Such policy or certificate shall be issued by the insurer without evidence of insurability, provided the certificate holder makes application for the policy and pays the monthly premium within 30 days after receiving written notice of such cancellation, refusal to renew, or termination.  No long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall contain a provision establishing a new waiting period in the event existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new form or another form within the same company, except with respect to an increase in benefits voluntarily selected by the insured individual or group policyholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unless the group policy from which conversion is made replaces previous group coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy from which conversion is made.  If the group policy from which conversion is made replaces previous group coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy replaced.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any insured individual whose eligibility for group long-term care coverage is based upon that person's relationship to another person, shall be entitled to continuation of coverage under the group policy upon termination of the qualifying relationship by death or dissolution of marriage.
