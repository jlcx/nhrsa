The term includes group and individual annuities and life insurance policies, certificates, or riders that provide directly or supplement long-term care insurance.

With regard to life insurance, this term does not include life insurance policies that accelerate the death benefit specifically for one or more of the qualifying events of terminal illness, medical conditions requiring extraordinary medical intervention or permanent institutional confinement, and that provide the option of a lump-sum payment for those benefits and where neither the benefits nor the eligibility for the benefits is conditioned upon the receipt of long-term care.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any product advertised, marketed, or offered as long-term care insurance shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Loss ratio standards'' means the minimum anticipated loss ratio permitted for a long-term care insurance policy or certificate.  The anticipated loss ratio is that which is expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the policy or, at the option of the insurer, 20 years, whichever is shorter.  Such a loss ratio shall be based on a typical distribution of business anticipated to be sold in a period of 12 months and followed to its conclusion.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The only insurance protection provided under the contract is coverage of qualified long-term care services.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The contract does not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items to the extent that the expenses are reimbursable under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, as amended, or would be so reimbursable but for the application of a deductible or coinsurance amount.  The requirements of this subparagraph do not apply to expenses that are reimbursable under Title XVIII of the Society Security Act only as a secondary payor.  A contract shall not fail to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph by reason of payments being made on a per diem or other periodic basis without regard to the expense incurred during the period to which the payments relate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The contract is guaranteed renewable, within the meaning of Section 7702B(b)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The contract does not provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged as collateral for a loan, or borrowed except as provided in subparagraph (e);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) All refunds of premiums, and all policyholder dividends or similar amounts, under the contract are to be applied as a reduction in future premiums or to increase future benefits, except that a refund on the event of death of the insured or a complete surrender or cancellation of the contract cannot exceed the aggregate premiums paid under the contract;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The contract meets the consumer protection provisions set forth in Section 7702(b)(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The portion of a life insurance contract that provides long-term care insurance coverage by rider or as part of the contract and that satisfies the requirements of Sections 7702B(b) and (e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

<center><h3>Section 415-D:5</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-D:5 Disclosure and Performance Standards for Long-Term Care Insurance;  Rulemaking. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner may adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, that include standards for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Full and fair disclosure, that set forth the manner, content, and required disclosures for the sale of long-term care insurance policies and certificates, terms of renewability, initial and subsequent conditions of eligibility, non-duplication of coverage provisions, coverage of dependents, preexisting conditions, termination of insurance, continuation or conversion, probationary periods, limitations, exceptions, reductions, elimination periods, requirements for replacement, recurrent conditions, and definitions of terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No long-term care insurance policy may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Be cancelled, nonrenewed or otherwise terminated on the grounds of the age or deterioration of the mental or physical health of the insured individual or certificate holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Contain a provision establishing a new waiting period in the event existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new or other form within the same company, except with respect to an increase in benefits voluntarily selected by the insured individual or group policyholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide coverage for skilled nursing care only or provide significantly more coverage for skilled care in a facility than coverage for lower levels of care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Be misleading or unreasonably confusing in connection with either the purchase of long-term care insurance or the settlement of claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Be contrary to the health care needs of the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Be so limited in scope as to be of no significant economic value to the holders of such policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Be issued if not specifically authorized by statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) In the opinion of the commissioner, be unjust, unfair, and unfairly discriminatory to the policyholder, certificate holder, subscriber or any other person insured under the policy or certificate, or the beneficiary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) No long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall use a definition of preexisting condition that is more restrictive than the following:  "Preexisting condition'' means a condition for which medical advice or treatment was recommended by, or received from a provider of health care services, within 6 months preceding the effective date of coverage of an insured person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No long-term care insurance policy or certificate may exclude coverage for a loss or confinement that is the result of a preexisting condition unless the loss or confinement begins within 6 months following the effective date of coverage of an insured person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner may extend the limitation periods set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b) as to specific age group categories in specific policy forms upon findings that the extension is in the best interest of the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The definition of "preexisting condition'' does not prohibit an insurer from using an application form designed to elicit the complete health history of an applicant, and, on the basis of the answers on that application, from underwriting in accordance with that insurers established underwriting standards.  Unless otherwise provided in the policy or certificate, a preexisting condition, regardless of whether it is disclosed on the application, need not be covered until the waiting period described in subparagraph (b) expires.  No long-term care insurance policy or certificate may exclude or use waivers or riders of any kind to exclude, limit, or reduce coverage or benefits for specifically named or described preexisting diseases or physical conditions beyond the waiting period described in subparagraph (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) No long-term care insurance policy may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state if such policy:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Conditions eligibility for any benefits on a prior hospitalization requirement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Conditions eligibility for benefits provided in an institutional care setting on the receipt of a higher level of institutional care;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Conditions eligibility for any benefits other than waiver of premium, post-confinement, post-acute care, or recuperative benefits on a prior institutionalization requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A long-term care insurance policy containing post-confinement, post-acute care, or recuperative benefits shall clearly label in a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate entitled "Limitations or Conditions on Eligibility for Benefits'' such limitations or conditions, including any required number of days of confinement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A long-term care insurance policy or rider that conditions eligibility of noninstitutional benefits on the prior receipt of institutional care shall not require a prior institutional stay of more than 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) No long-term care insurance policy or rider that provides benefits only following institutionalization shall condition such benefits upon admission to a facility for the same or related conditions within a period of less than 30 days after discharge from the institution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner may adopt rules establishing loss ratio standards for long-term care insurance policies provided that a specific reference to long-term care insurance policies is contained in the rule.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-D:6 Cancellation of Insurance;  Conversion. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An individual long-term care insurance policy shall not be cancelled, refused renewal, or otherwise terminated by the insurer, except where the required premium has not been paid by or on behalf of the insured;  however, this shall not restrict or limit the insurer's right to rescind or revise a policy in the event of fraud or misrepresentation during the contestable period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a group policy is cancelled, refused renewal or terminated by either the insurer or the policyholder, each certificate holder shall be entitled to have issued to him or her an individual policy or replacement group certificate of insurance providing benefits equivalent to those enjoyed by the certificate holder under the group policy from which conversion is made.  Such policy or certificate shall be issued by the insurer without evidence of insurability, provided the certificate holder makes application for the policy and pays the monthly premium within 30 days after receiving written notice of such cancellation, refusal to renew, or termination.  No long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall contain a provision establishing a new waiting period in the event existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new form or another form within the same company, except with respect to an increase in benefits voluntarily selected by the insured individual or group policyholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unless the group policy from which conversion is made replaces previous group coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy from which conversion is made.  If the group policy from which conversion is made replaces previous group coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy replaced.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any insured individual whose eligibility for group long-term care coverage is based upon that person's relationship to another person, shall be entitled to continuation of coverage under the group policy upon termination of the qualifying relationship by death or dissolution of marriage.

<center><h3>Section 415-D:9</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-D:9 Incontestability Period. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For a policy or certificate that has been in force for less than 6 months, an insurer may rescind a long-term care insurance policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long-term care insurance claim upon a showing of misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance for coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For a policy or certificate that has been in force for at least 6 months but less than 2-years, an insurer may rescind a long-term care insurance policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long-term care insurance claim upon a showing of misrepresentation that is both material to the acceptance for coverage and which pertains to the condition for which benefits are sought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. After a policy or certificate has been in force for 2 years, it is not contestable upon the grounds of misrepresentation alone;  such policy or certificate may be contested only upon a showing that the insured knowingly and intentionally misrepresented relevant facts relating to the insured's health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No long-term care insurance policy or certificate may be field issued based on medical or health status.  For purposes of this section, "field issued'' means a policy or certificate issued by an agent or a third party administrator pursuant to the underwriting authority granted to the agent or third party administrator by an insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If an insurer has paid benefits under the long-term care insurance policy or certificate, the benefit payments may not be recovered by the insurer in the event that the policy or certificate is rescinded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In the event of the death of the insured, this section shall not apply to the remaining death benefit of a life insurance policy that accelerates benefits for long-term care.  In this situation, the remaining death benefits under these policies shall be governed by RSA 408:10.  In all other situations, this section shall apply to life insurance policies that accelerate benefits for long-term care.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-D:10 Nonforfeiture Benefits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, a long-term care insurance policy shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the policyholder or certificate holder has been offered the option of purchasing a policy or certificate including a nonforfeiture benefit.  The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy.  In the event the policyholder or certificate holder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that shall be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a group long-term care insurance policy is issued, the offer required in paragraph I shall be made to the group policyholder.  However, if the policy is issued as group long-term care insurance as defined in RSA 415-D:3, IV(d), other than to a continuing care retirement community or other similar entity, the offering shall be made to each proposed certificate holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall promulgate regulations specifying the type or types of nonforfeiture benefits to be offered as part of long-term care insurance policies and certificates, the standards for nonforfeiture benefits, and the rules regarding contingent benefit upon lapse, including a determination of the specified period of time during which a contingent benefit upon lapse will be available and the substantial premium rate increase that triggers a contingent benefit upon lapse as described in paragraph I.
