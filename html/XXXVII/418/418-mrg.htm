<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The bond with sureties approved by the commissioner shall be in such amount, not less than $300,000 nor more than $1,500,000, as required by the commissioner.  All documents filed are to be in the English language.  If the purposes of the society conform to the requirements of this chapter and all provisions of the law have been complied with, the commissioner shall so certify, retain and file the articles of incorporation and furnish the incorporators a preliminary certificate of authority authorizing the society to solicit members pursuant to paragraph IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No preliminary certificate of authority granted under the provisions of this section shall be valid after one year from its date or after such further period, not exceeding one year, as may be authorized by the commissioner upon cause shown, unless the 500 applicants hereinafter required have been secured and the organization has been completed as herein provided.  The articles of incorporation and all other proceedings thereunder shall become null and void in one year from the date of the preliminary certificate of authority, or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society shall have completed its organization and received a certificate of authority to do business pursuant to paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon receipt of a preliminary certificate of authority from the commissioner, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates, and shall issue to each such applicant a receipt for the amount so collected.  No society shall incur any liability other than for the return of such advance premium, nor issue any certificate, nor pay, allow, or offer or promise to pay or allow, any benefit to any person until:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Actual bona fide applications for benefits have been secured on not less than 500 applicants, and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) It shall have been shown to the commissioner, by sworn statement of the treasurer, or corresponding officer of such society, that at least 500 applicants have each paid in cash at least one regular monthly premium as herein provided, which premiums in the aggregate shall amount to at least $150,000.  The advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization and if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one year, such premiums shall be returned to the applicants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may make such examination and require such further information as the commissioner deems advisable.  Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the society has complied with all the provisions of law, the commissioner shall issue to the society a certificate of authority to that effect and that the society is authorized to transact business pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.  The certificate of authority shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of the society at the date of such certificate.  The commissioner shall cause a record of such certificate of authority to be made.  A certified copy of such record may be given in evidence with like effect as the original certificate of authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Evidence that at least 60 days prior to the action of the supreme governing body of each society, the text of the contract has been furnished to all members of each society either by mail or by publication in full in the official publication of each society.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the commissioner finds that the contract is in conformity with the provisions of this section, that the financial statements are correct, and that the consolidation or merger is just and equitable to the members of each society, the commissioner shall approve the contract and issue a certificate to such effect.  Upon such approval, the contract shall be in full force and effect unless any society which is a party to the contract is incorporated under the laws of any other state or territory.  In such event the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved as provided by the laws of such state or territory and a certificate of such approval filed with the commissioner of this state or, if the laws of such state or territory contain no such provision, then the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved by the commissioner of insurance of such state or territory and a certificate of such approval filed with the commissioner of this state.  In case such contract is not approved it shall be inoperative, and the fact of submission and its contents shall not be disclosed by the commissioner of this state.

IV. The affidavit of any officer of the society or of anyone authorized by it to mail any notice or document, stating that such notice or document has been duly addressed and mailed, shall be prima facie evidence that such notice or document has been furnished the addressees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V.

II. Any changes, additions or amendments to the laws of the society duly made or enacted subsequent to the issuance of the certificate, shall bind the owner and the beneficiaries, and shall govern and control the benefit contract in all respects the same as though such changes, additions or amendments had been made prior to and were in force at the time of the application for insurance, except that no change, addition or amendment shall destroy or diminish benefits which the society contracted to give the owner as of the date of issuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person upon whose life a benefit contract is issued prior to attaining the age of majority shall be bound by the terms of the application and certificate and by all the laws and rules of the society to the same extent as though the age of majority had been attained at the time of application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A society shall provide in its laws that if its reserves as to all or any class of certificates become impaired its board of directors or corresponding body may require that there shall be paid by the owner to the society the amount of the owner's equitable proportion of such deficiency as ascertained by its board, and that if the payment is not made either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It shall stand as an indebtedness against the certificate and draw interest not to exceed the rate specified for certificate loans under the certificates;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In lieu of or in combination with subparagraph (a), the owner may accept a proportionate reduction in benefits under the certificate.  The society may specify the manner of the election and which alternative is to be presumed if no election is made.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The certificate shall also contain a provision stating the amount of premiums which are payable under the certificate and a provision reciting or setting forth the substance of any sections of the society's laws or rules in force at the time of issuance of the certificate which, if violated, will result in the termination or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If the laws of the society provide for expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate shall also contain a provision that any member so expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance, shall have the privilege of maintaining the certificate in force by continuing payment of the required premium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Benefit contracts issued on the lives of persons below the society's minimum age for adult membership may provide for transfer of control of ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate.  A society may require approval of an application for membership in order to effect this transfer, and may provide in all other respects for the regulation, government and control of such certificates and all rights, obligations and liabilities incident thereto and connected therewith.  Ownership rights prior to such transfer shall be specified in the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A society may specify the terms and conditions on which benefit contracts may be assigned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. No action at law or in equity shall be had or maintained on any certificate or contract issued by a fraternal benefit society unless commenced within 18 months after the cause of action shall accrue.
