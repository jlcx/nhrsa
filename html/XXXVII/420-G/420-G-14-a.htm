The commissioner shall request and health carriers shall supply information and data no later than June 1 of each year sufficient to report on the small employer health insurance market.  Such information shall be reported for the market as a whole and by market segment.  At the commissioner's discretion, such information may include, but not be limited to, information relating to premium rates and rating practices, the number of groups and individuals insured, availability of coverage and benefit plans, trend, loss ratios, administration costs, and profitability.  The commissioner shall file a report of the information by December 1 of each year with the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, the chairperson of the house commerce committee, and the chairperson of the senate banks and insurance committee.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII.

The commissioner shall evaluate claims costs, administrative loads, and health carrier profits.  The commissioner shall identify the factors that contribute to cost increases affecting health insurance premiums and health care services in New Hampshire.  The commissioner shall identify variations in the price that health carriers pay for health care services and shall undertake further analysis to determine whether the observed price variations correlate to the sickness or the complexity of the population served, the relative proportion of patients on Medicare or Medicaid that are served by the health care provider, the cost to the health care provider of delivering the service, or the relative proportion of free or reduced care provided to the uninsured.  In advance of holding the public hearing, the commissioner may require any health insurer or third party administrator to produce documents and information deemed necessary and relevant to evaluate the factors that contribute to cost growth in health care services, increased utilization of health care, and health insurance premium costs.  The commissioner shall keep confidential all nonpublic documents and shall not disclose those documents without the consent of the health care provider or health care payer that produced the information or documents.  The commissioner may compel a health insurance carrier or third party administrator to testify at the annual public hearing.  The commissioner may also invite representatives of health care providers to provide relevant information.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. (a) The commissioner shall prepare an annual report concerning premium rates in the health insurance market and the factors that have contributed to rate increases during prior years.  The annual report shall be designed to provide information which identifies and quantifies health care spending trends and the underlying factors that contributed to increases in health insurance premiums.
