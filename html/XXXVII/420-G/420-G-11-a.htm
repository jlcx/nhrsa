I. The department and the department of health and human services shall enter into a memorandum of understanding for collaboration in the development of a comprehensive health care information system.  The memorandum of understanding shall include a description of the data sets that will be included in the comprehensive health care information system, the criteria and procedures for the development of limited use data sets, the criteria and procedures to ensure that Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant limited use data sets are accessible, and a proposed time frame for the creation of a comprehensive health care information system.  To the extent allowed by HIPAA, the data shall be available as a resource for insurers, employers, providers, purchasers of health care, and state agencies to continuously review health care utilization, expenditures, and performance in New Hampshire and to enhance the ability of New Hampshire consumers and employers to make informed and cost-effective health care choices.  In presenting data for public access, comparative considerations shall be made regarding geography, demographics, general economic factors, and institutional size.  Notwithstanding HIPAA or any other provision of law, the comprehensive health care information system shall not include or disclose any data that contains direct personal identifiers.  For the purposes of this section, "direct personal identifiers'' include information relating to an individual that contains primary or obvious identifiers, such as the individual's name, street address, e-mail address, telephone number, and social security number.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner of the department of health and human services, with the approval of the commissioner of the insurance department, shall adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, as may be necessary to provide for the release of claims data from the comprehensive health care information system (CHIS).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department shall make available to the public a public use data set for purposes of facilitating transparency in health care costs.
