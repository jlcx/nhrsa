I. Health carriers operating in the small employer and/or individual markets shall make reasonable disclosure in solicitation and sales materials provided to individuals and small employers of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The methodology by which premium rates for an individual or specific small employer are established.  Each health carrier shall state that rates and practices are in full compliance with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The provisions concerning the health carrier's right to change premium rates and the factors which affect changes in premium rates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The provisions relating to renewability of health coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The provisions relating to any preexisting condition exclusions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The benefits and premiums available under all health insurance coverage for which the employer is qualified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) All health carriers, licensed third party administrators, and any entity required to be registered with the commissioner pursuant to RSA 402-H, shall electronically provide:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Their encrypted claims data to the department and to the department of health and human services in accordance with rules approved by the commissioner of health and humans services and adopted under RSA 420-G:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) To the department of health and human services, cross-matched claims data on requested policyholders, and subscriber information necessary for third party liability for benefits provided under RSA 167, filed in accordance with rules adopted under RSA 167:3-c.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding RSA 91-A:10, the collection storage and release of health care data and statistical information that is subject to the federal requirements of the Health Information Privacy and Accountability Act (HIPAA) shall be governed exclusively by the rules adopted thereunder in 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. All health carriers and other health plans that collect the Health Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) shall annually submit the HEDIS information to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All health carriers shall accept electronic claims submitted in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) format for UB-92 or HCFA-1500 records, or as amended by CMS.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The data submission requirements of paragraphs II and II-a shall apply with respect to claims data for all lives covered by a fully-insured health plan in any market in the state, by any self-funded plan for state or municipal employees, including any plan maintained under RSA 5-B, to any self-funded plan maintained by the university system of the state with respect to its employees or its students, and to any self-funded student health benefit plan maintained by an institution of higher education which provides 4-year bachelor's degree programs and graduate or professional degree programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to those lives listed in paragraph IV, the data submission requirements of paragraphs II and II-a shall also apply to all health carriers, licensed third party administrators, and any entity required to be registered with the commissioner pursuant to RSA 402-H with respect to claims data for all lives covered by any other self-funded employer-sponsored plan, when the employer has opted in writing to the submission of the data.  The carrier or administrator shall notify the employer of the employer's option to authorize submission of the data.  The commissioner shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A specifying the form of such opt in, which shall include, but not be limited to, notice to the employer regarding why it is receiving the notification form, the privacy protections for the data submitted should the employer choose to opt in, and the transparency benefits, including benefits to employers, of broad inclusion of as many lives as possible in the database created under RSA 420-G:11-a.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to impose any reporting obligation on any self-funded employer or plan sponsor, or to impose any requirement with respect to the manner in which any such self-funded plan is administered.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a health carrier or third party administrator from communicating its views to an employer about the employer's decision whether to opt in to the submission of claims data.
