In the case of deductible provisions and stop-loss provisions, the liability shall be for the same or overlapping benefit periods and shall be for expenses actually incurred and applied against the deductible and stop-loss provisions of the terminating carrier's plan but only to the extent those expenses are recognized under the terms of the succeeding carrier's plan and are subject to a similar stop-loss or deductible provision.  The terminating company shall inform its insureds at the time of cancellation that this provision is applicable to them and that this is a requirement of New Hampshire statute.  The provision should also appear in all policies or certificates where the provision about termination of the insurance company appears.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to prevent a succeeding carrier's plan from having stop-loss levels or deductible amounts that are higher than those specified in the terminating carrier's plan.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Whenever a determination of the terminating carrier's benefits is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the terminating carrier shall furnish, in a timely manner, but in no event later than 30 days, a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information, sufficient to permit verification of the terminating carrier's liability to the succeeding carrier.  Any determination of the liability of the terminating plan shall be made in accordance with all the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the terminating plan rather than those of the succeeding plan.  The benefit determination shall be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier.  The succeeding carrier shall notify the terminating carrier as to its liabilities pursuant to RSA 420-G:6, IX(b) and shall indemnify the insured for the same.  Upon determination of any liability of the terminating plan, the terminating plan shall pay the succeeding plan in a timely manner, in no event later than 15 days, upon receipt of said claim information.">
