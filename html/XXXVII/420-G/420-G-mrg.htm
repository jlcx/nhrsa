<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Health carriers shall calculate health coverage plan rates for each of the coverages or health benefit plans written by that carrier.  Variations in health coverage plan rates shall be solely attributable to variations in expected utilization or cost due to differences in coverage design and/or the provider contracts or other provider costs associated with specific coverages and shall not reflect differences due to the nature of the groups or eligible persons assumed to select particular health coverages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In establishing the premium charged, health carriers providing coverage to individuals and small employers shall calculate a rate that is derived from the health coverage plan rate through the application of rating factors that the carrier chooses to utilize consistent with 42 U.S.C. section 300gg and any regulations adopted thereunder, except that the state shall constitute a single geographic rating area.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to expand the authority of the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-G:4-a Rating Factor for Qualified Wellness or Disease Management Programs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In addition to the rating factors permitted in RSA 420-G:4, an insurer that offers a health benefit plan to individuals or small groups that includes a qualified wellness or disease management program may employ a rating factor that reflects the expected level of participation in the program and the anticipated effect the program will have on utilization or medical claim costs.  The maximum differential attributed to this factor, as measured by ratio, shall not exceed 1.25 to 1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Program materials shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval as a qualified program prior to the insurer's implementation of the rating factor.  A qualified wellness or disease management program shall meet the following standards, to the extent applicable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The program shall meet the requirements set forth in the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) for bona fide wellness programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The program shall provide significant financial incentives to covered employees or individuals for participating in the program and may also include special financial incentives to providers of wellness or disease management services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The program shall provide to covered employees or individuals for whom it is unreasonably difficult to satisfy the program's applicable standards reasonable alternative methods for achieving program participation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The methodology proposed by the insurer for establishing rating factors for individuals or small groups shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval prior to implementation.  The methodology shall specify how the rating factor will vary based on the anticipated efficacy of the program in reducing expected utilization or medical claim costs.  The methodology may take into consideration:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The anticipated average percentage of employees or individuals eligible to participate in the program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The anticipated efficacy of the financial incentives in producing high levels of program participation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The level of program participation achieved in prior coverage periods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The expected success rate for program participants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Clinical studies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The insurer's experience in the use of the program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-G:4-b New Hampshire HealthFirst;  Standard and Basic Wellness Plans for Small Employers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this section is to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Promote the availability of more affordable health coverage in the small employer market by engaging consumers, health care providers, insurers, and small employers to address the underlying costs of health care through better care management and more efficient utilization of health care services without increasing overall cost sharing requirements or reducing coverage for services essential to health and wellness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enhance competition among health carriers in the small employer market by facilitating comparison of a standard plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a health carrier offers coverage in the small employer market in this state and had at least 1,000 covered lives in this market at the end of the prior calendar year, such carrier shall be required to offer the basic wellness plan and the standard wellness plan to small employers.  The standard wellness plan shall be offered on a guaranteed issue basis to all small employers in the state.  If a health carrier is part of an insurance holding company system, as defined in RSA 401-B:1, IV, in which 2 or more affiliates, as defined in RSA 401-B:1, I, are licensed health carriers in the state with a combined New Hampshire small group membership of at least 1,000 covered lives at the end of the prior calendar year, the requirement in this paragraph to offer the standard wellness plan to all small employers shall apply.  However, only one such health carrier affiliate in the holding company group shall be subject to the requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the requirements for the basic wellness plan and the standard wellness plan.  Before adopting rules, the commissioner shall convene a standing advisory committee to include representatives of small employers, business groups and associations of small employers, consumers who obtain their coverage through the small employer market, one representative, appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives and one member of the senate, appointed by the president of the senate.  The advisory committee shall, at least once every 3 years, make recommendations to the insurance commissioner on the requirements for the basic wellness plan and the standard wellness plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The standard wellness plan requirements shall be established so that small employer health insurance carriers would be reasonably expected to set the plan's health coverage plan rate, as defined in RSA 420-G:4, I(c), at or below the target rate of 10 percent of the prior year's median statewide wage as reported by the United States Department of Labor.  In order to assist the advisory committee in making its recommendations, the commissioner shall engage an actuarial expert at the expense of the small employer carriers that are subject to RSA 420-G:4-b, II to confirm that the proposed standard wellness plan requirements are reasonable in relation to the target health plan coverage rate.  The plan shall include benefit structure, cost sharing requirements, and provider payment initiatives consistent with the incentive required in paragraph VI.  The committee shall recommend an out-of-pocket maximum for the standard wellness plan.  Throughout the process of developing its recommendations, the advisory committee shall consult with interested health carriers, health insurance producers, health care providers, the actuarial expert retained by the commissioner, and, as necessary and appropriate, other available experts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The basic wellness plan requirements shall be established to promote wellness and preventive care through affordable insurance coverage.  The basic wellness plan shall be designed so that the premium for the plan is comparable to or below the lowest cost major medical health insurance presently offered in the small group market that meets the definition of health coverage under RSA 420-G:2, IX.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner shall ensure that the basic wellness plan and the standard wellness plan create incentives for consumers, health care providers, employers, and/or health carriers to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Promote wellness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Promote primary care, preventive care, and a medical home model.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Manage and coordinate care for persons with chronic health conditions or acute illness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Promote the use of cost effective care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Promote quality of care by the use of evidence-based, best practice standards and patient-centered care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. To the extent practicable, health carriers shall be permitted to utilize existing programs to meet the requirements for the basic and standard wellness plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The standard wellness plan shall be made available in accordance with this section on October 1, 2009, or as soon thereafter as practicable and shall be reviewed and revised as necessary, but no less frequently than once every 3 years after the date of initial offer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. (a) Small employer carriers shall be required to file their standard wellness plan rates 60 days prior to the date on which the plan is to be made available.  If at least one small employer carrier files a health coverage plan rate at or below the stated target, then each carrier subject to RSA 420-G:4-b, II shall offer the standard wellness plan at its own filed and approved rate.  If no small employer carrier files a health coverage plan rate at or below the stated target, then the commissioner shall hold a hearing on the reasonableness of the proposed standard wellness plan benefits in relation to the target health plan coverage rate to determine whether small employer carriers subject to RSA 420-G:4-b, II shall be required to offer the standard wellness plan at a health coverage plan rate equal to the target rate or whether changes should be made to the standard wellness plan requirements to adjust benefits or cost sharing requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Between plan revisions, carriers may request rate adjustments with appropriate supporting documentation.  However, the commissioner shall not grant any rate adjustment in excess of the carrier's overall small group trend.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All small employer carrier filings made in accordance with this section shall be subject to approval under RSA 420-G:4, I(h).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. In establishing the requirements for the standard wellness plan, the commissioner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) May require the use of qualified wellness or disease management programs and the use of rating factors for such programs as provided in RSA 420-G:4-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Shall prohibit small employer carriers from offering nonconforming products with similar benefit designs with the intent or likely effect of undermining the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Shall require small employer carriers to illustrate or quote the standard wellness plan together with any proposal or quote provided to any small employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Except as specifically provided in this section, all statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to small employer health benefit plans shall apply to the basic and standard wellness plans.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-G:4-c Health Coverage Tax Incentive Plan. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any carrier that offers small group health coverage in the state shall make its small employer group coverage available with a limited open enrollment period to individual employees of small employers when the coverage is purchased through a premium only cafeteria plan that satisfies the requirements of 26 U.S.C. section 125 and RSA 275:43-c.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A carrier shall offer a limited open enrollment period consistent with the requirements of RSA 420-G:8, I-a during which time an employee having a cafeteria plan under RSA 275:43-c may purchase small employer group health coverage.  A carrier may apply its rating factor for group size of one to the premium charged for coverage sold to an employee on an individual basis through a payroll deduction, but shall not apply participation requirements under RSA 420-G:9, I to coverage purchased by an employee through a cafeteria plan established pursuant to RSA 275:43-c.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-G:5 Medical Underwriting. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Health carriers providing health coverage for individuals may perform medical underwriting, including the use of health statements or screenings or the use of prior claims history, to the extent necessary to establish or modify premium rates as provided in RSA 420-G:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Health carriers providing health coverage for individuals may refuse to write or issue coverage to an individual because of his or her health status.  Regardless of claim experience, health status, or medical history, health carriers providing health coverage for small employers shall not refuse to write or issue any of their available coverages or health benefit plans to any small employer group that elects to be covered under that plan and agrees to make premium payments and meet the other requirements of the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Health carriers providing health coverage for small employer groups shall not knowingly provide health coverage to groups where the employer has discriminated based on health status or claims history against any employee or potential employee or his or her dependents with respect to participation in an employer-sponsored health benefit plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Health carriers shall not offer riders or endorsements to exclude certain illnesses or health conditions in order to avoid the purpose of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Individual health insurance carriers shall be responsible for ascertaining the eligibility of any individual applicant or insured for high risk pool coverage.  If a carrier determines that an individual meets any of the eligibility criteria set forth in RSA 404-G:5-e, the carrier shall give the individual written notice, with the declination of coverage, the coverage offering or upon a rate increase at renewal.  The notice shall include information about available benefits and exclusions of high risk pool coverage and the name, address, and telephone number of the pool administrator or the administrator's designee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. It shall constitute an unfair trade practice under RSA 417 for an insurer, insurance producer, or third party administrator to refer an individual employee to the pool, or arrange for an individual employee to apply to the pool, for the purpose of separating that employee from group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the employee's employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Health carriers and health insurance producers shall ensure that persons seeking coverage through a small employer group who are required to complete a health statement have an option to convey the required information directly to the carrier or the producer through a secure means and bypassing the employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Health carriers shall provide coverage for medically necessary dental services resulting from an accidental injury to sound natural teeth and gums when the course of treatment for the accidental injury is received or authorized within 3 months of the date of the injury.  Treatment made necessary due to injury to the jaw and oral structures other than teeth shall be covered without time limit.  Coverage hereunder shall be subject to such other terms and conditions of the policy that may apply.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Make no adjustments in the health status factor applied to individuals moving from a discontinued product of that health carrier to another product of that health carrier if the individual was newly covered under the previous product within the last 5 years, or a health status factor adjustment was made with respect to that individual within the last 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Where a health carrier decides to discontinue all of its health coverage in the individual market, small employer market, large employer market or any combination thereof, the health carrier must provide at least 180-days notice of such discontinuation to the commissioner, to each individual or employer with such health coverage and to all covered persons;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. A health carrier which has discontinued coverage in the individual market, the small employer market, or any combination thereof, in accordance with paragraph VII, shall continue to be liable for the payment of claims in accordance with the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) This section shall apply only to terminating carriers of insureds who obtain creditable replacement health coverage.  This paragraph shall be effective with respect to all in-force policies, certificates, or other evidences of coverage as of the effective date of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The terminating carrier shall continue to be liable for the payment of claims if the succeeding carrier's policy requires the satisfaction of any deductibles, individual or family stop-loss provisions limiting out-of-pocket payments, or waiting periods in its plan but only to the extent satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the same or similar provisions were included in the terminated plan providing similar benefits.  In the case of deductible provisions and stop-loss provisions, the liability shall be for the same or overlapping benefit periods and shall be for expenses actually incurred and applied against the deductible and stop-loss provisions of the terminating carrier's plan but only to the extent those expenses are recognized under the terms of the succeeding carrier's plan and are subject to a similar stop-loss or deductible provision.  The terminating company shall inform its insureds at the time of cancellation that this provision is applicable to them and that this is a requirement of New Hampshire statute.  The provision should also appear in all policies or certificates where the provision about termination of the insurance company appears.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to prevent a succeeding carrier's plan from having stop-loss levels or deductible amounts that are higher than those specified in the terminating carrier's plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whenever a determination of the terminating carrier's benefits is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the terminating carrier shall furnish, in a timely manner, but in no event later than 30 days, a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information, sufficient to permit verification of the terminating carrier's liability to the succeeding carrier.  Any determination of the liability of the terminating plan shall be made in accordance with all the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the terminating plan rather than those of the succeeding plan.  The benefit determination shall be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier.  The succeeding carrier shall notify the terminating carrier as to its liabilities pursuant to RSA 420-G:6, IX(b) and shall indemnify the insured for the same.  Upon determination of any liability of the terminating plan, the terminating plan shall pay the succeeding plan in a timely manner, in no event later than 15 days, upon receipt of said claim information.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) Such preexisting condition exclusion period may only apply to a condition, whether physical or mental, regardless of the cause of the condition, for which medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment was recommended or received during the 3 months immediately preceding the enrollment date of health coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A health carrier providing health coverage to individuals or small employers may impose a preexisting condition exclusion period, but only if it is at least as favorable to covered persons as the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No preexisting condition exclusion period shall extend beyond a period of 9 consecutive months after the date of enrollment of the person's health coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such preexisting condition exclusion period may only apply to a condition, whether physical or mental, regardless of the cause of the condition, for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was received or recommended during the 3 months immediately preceding the date of enrollment of the person's health coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In applying a preexisting condition exclusion period, a health carrier shall credit the time the person was covered under previous health coverage subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A period of otherwise creditable coverage shall not be counted if, after such period and before the enrollment date or application date of new health coverage, there was a 63-day period during all of which the person was not covered under any creditable coverage;  except that
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any length of time that a person is in an employer imposed waiting period for health coverage shall not be counted toward the 63-day period described above;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a person did not have health coverage during a period of unemployment prior to the effective date of new employer-based group health coverage, the lack of health coverage during the period of unemployment shall be disregarded and, for the purposes of crediting coverage, coverage shall be considered to have been continuous from the date of termination of the person's health coverage immediately prior to the period of unemployment to the effective date of the new employer-based group health coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Health carriers providing health coverage in the large employer market may use the alternative method of crediting coverage as specified in rules.

(b) A health carrier, which elects to credit coverage under the method set forth in rules pursuant to paragraph IV that enrolls a person with a certificate of creditable coverage, may request of the entity that issued the certificate the additional information required under the rules.  The issuing entity shall promptly disclose such information to the health carrier, but may charge the reasonable costs of disclosing such information.

(b) Impose any preexisting condition exclusion relating to pregnancy as a preexisting condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subject to subparagraph (3), impose any preexisting condition exclusion in the case of a child who is adopted or placed for adoption before attaining 18 years of age and who, as of the last day of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the adoption or placement for adoption, is covered under creditable coverage.

I. A health carrier may not require more than the minimum participation percentage of the employees eligible for health coverage in a small employer group to participate in the health carrier's health coverage plan.  The minimum participation percentage shall be 75 percent when the health carrier's plan is the sole health coverage plan being sponsored by the employer group, and 37.5 percent when the health carrier's plan is not the sole health coverage plan being sponsored by the employer group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purpose of calculating whether or not a small employer group's enrollment meets a carrier's minimum participation requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any full-time or part-time employees who are covered as a dependent on another person's health coverage shall be excluded from the count.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The total number of full-time employees and part-time employees who are otherwise eligible for health coverage shall be counted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The minimum participation requirements shall be calculated on an employer-by-employer basis if the small employer is part of an association, trust, or other similar arrangement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In performing the computation to determine the actual enrollment necessary to meet the minimum participation requirement as a small employer group, the health carrier shall round any fractional number to the higher integer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-G:14-a Requested Information. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As authorized in accordance with RSA 420-G:14, the commissioner may request the submission of such information by carriers as is necessary to better understand the coverage history and choices of participants in the nongroup market.  The commissioner shall make every attempt to ensure the reasonableness of such request, both in terms of scope and timeframe, and to limit this request to information the commissioner deems necessary to better understand the dynamics of the nongroup health insurance market and to assess the appropriateness of alternative sources of funding for the nongroup subsidy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall request and health carriers shall supply information and data no later than June 1 of each year sufficient to report on the small employer health insurance market.  Such information shall be reported for the market as a whole and by market segment.  At the commissioner's discretion, such information may include, but not be limited to, information relating to premium rates and rating practices, the number of groups and individuals insured, availability of coverage and benefit plans, trend, loss ratios, administration costs, and profitability.  The commissioner shall file a report of the information by December 1 of each year with the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, the chairperson of the house commerce committee, and the chairperson of the senate banks and insurance committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall request and health carriers shall supply information no later than June 1 of each year sufficient to report on the types of health coverage being purchased by individuals and employers by geographic area.

V. The commissioner shall hold an annual public hearing concerning premium rates in the health insurance market and the factors, including health care costs and cost trends, that have contributed to rate increases during the prior year.  The commissioner shall evaluate claims costs, administrative loads, and health carrier profits.  The commissioner shall identify the factors that contribute to cost increases affecting health insurance premiums and health care services in New Hampshire.  The commissioner shall identify variations in the price that health carriers pay for health care services and shall undertake further analysis to determine whether the observed price variations correlate to the sickness or the complexity of the population served, the relative proportion of patients on Medicare or Medicaid that are served by the health care provider, the cost to the health care provider of delivering the service, or the relative proportion of free or reduced care provided to the uninsured.  In advance of holding the public hearing, the commissioner may require any health insurer or third party administrator to produce documents and information deemed necessary and relevant to evaluate the factors that contribute to cost growth in health care services, increased utilization of health care, and health insurance premium costs.  The commissioner shall keep confidential all nonpublic documents and shall not disclose those documents without the consent of the health care provider or health care payer that produced the information or documents.  The commissioner may compel a health insurance carrier or third party administrator to testify at the annual public hearing.  The commissioner may also invite representatives of health care providers to provide relevant information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) The commissioner shall prepare an annual report concerning premium rates in the health insurance market and the factors that have contributed to rate increases during prior years.  The annual report shall be designed to provide information which identifies and quantifies health care spending trends and the underlying factors that contributed to increases in health insurance premiums.  The report shall include recommendations and strategies for increasing the efficiency of New Hampshire's health care financing and delivery system.  The report shall be based to the highest extent possible on the commissioner's analysis of information and data available to the commissioner, including:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Information and analysis of the amount and impact of uncompensated care.
<br>

(2) Past and current medical loss ratios of insurance carriers in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Comparison and analysis of the cost of medical care by payment type.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Comparison and analysis to insurance claim data collected by other states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) Testimony at the public hearing, and any other information or documents submitted in connection with the public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner shall submit the annual report to the governor, the president of the senate, and the speaker of the house of representatives on or before November 1 of each year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In conjunction with the annual public hearing required under paragraph V and the report and recommendations required under paragraph VI, the commissioner shall consider any pertinent work of other legislative commissions and inquires focused on related matters.
