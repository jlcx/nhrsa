&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-C:7 Rules and Operating Procedures;  Rulemaking Functions of the Commission and Opting Out of Uniform Standards. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this chapter, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission.  Before the commission adopts a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee or committees in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard.  The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A uniform standard shall become effective 90 days after its promulgation by the commission or such later date as the commission may determine;  provided, however, that a compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this chapter.  "Opt out'' shall be defined as any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated uniform standard.  All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure or amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or rule duly promulgated by the insurance department under the compacting state's administrative procedure act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by rule, it shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Give written notice to the commission no later than 10 business days after the uniform standard is promulgated, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state.  The commissioner shall consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a compacting state may, at the time of its enactment of this compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in this compact.  Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the rule opting out becomes effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or rule implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the state.  If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under RSA 408-C:14 for withdrawals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by rule, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least 15 days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state.  The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success.  If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to 90 days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission;  provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge that prevents the compacting state from opting out.  A stay may be terminated by the commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Not later than 30 days after a rule or operating procedure is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure;  provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success.  The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission shall promulgate rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets.  The commission may promulgate additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission;  provided, that disclosure to the commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement;  and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, the commission shall not be subject to the compacting state's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession.  Confidential information of the commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures.  The commission shall notify any non-complying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules or operating procedures.  If a non-complying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in RSA 408-C:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state's laws.  The commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the following provisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) With respect to the commissioner's market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the compact except upon a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize the action.  However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph shall not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the commission's action on such requests.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to commission rules and operating procedures.

The commission shall promulgate rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing.  An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with RSA 408-C:3, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet the relevant uniform standard.

II.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-C:14 Withdrawal, Default, and Termination. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state;  provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact ("withdrawing state'') by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute.  However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in subparagraph (e).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner of the withdrawing state shall immediately notify the management committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commission shall notify the other compacting states of the introduction of such legislation with 10 days after its receipt of notice thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The withdrawing state is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state.  The commission's approval of products and advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the withdrawing state, unless formally rescinded by the withdrawing state in the same manner as provided by the laws of the withdrawing state for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the effective date of the withdrawing state reenacting the compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) If the commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted ("defaulting state'') in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or duly promulgated rules or operating procedures, then, after notice and hearing as set forth in the bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact on the defaulting state shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the commission.  The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in commission rules.  The commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the defaulting state's suspension pending a cure of the default.  The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default.  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Product approvals by the commission or product self-certifications, or any advertisement in connection with such product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the defaulting state in the same manner as if the defaulting state had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to RSA 408-C:14, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires a reenactment of the compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compact state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
