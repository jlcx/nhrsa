For advertisement that is subject to the commission's authority, any rule, uniform standard or other requirement of the commission which governs the content of the advertisement shall constitute the exclusive provision that a commissioner may apply to the content of the advertisement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action taken by the commission shall abrogate or restrict:
