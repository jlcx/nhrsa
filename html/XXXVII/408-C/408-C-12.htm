To fund the cost of its initial operation, the commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, compacting states and other sources.  Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third party filer filing a product with the commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the commission's annual budget.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements of all funds under its control.  The internal financial accounts of the commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its bylaws.  The financial accounts and reporting including the system of internal controls and procedures of the commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant.  Upon the determination of the commission, but no less frequently than every 3 years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the commission.  The commission shall make an annual report to the governor and legislature of the compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit.  The commission's internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the commissioner of any compacting state upon request provided, however, that any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers' proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
