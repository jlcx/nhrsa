<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The compacting states hereby create and establish a joint public agency known as the "Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission.''  Pursuant to RSA 408-C:4, the commission shall have the power to develop uniform standards for product lines, receive and provide prompt review of products filed therewith, and give approval to those product filings satisfying applicable uniform standards;  provided, it is not intended for the commission to be the exclusive entity for receipt and review of insurance product filings.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit any insurer from filing its product in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance;  and any such filing shall be subject to the laws of the state where filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission is a body corporate and politic, and an instrumentality of the compacting states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission is solely responsible for its liabilities except as otherwise specifically provided in this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located.
