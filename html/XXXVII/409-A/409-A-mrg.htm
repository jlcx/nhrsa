&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:3 Compulsory Contract Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of contracts issued on or after the operative date of this chapter as defined in RSA 409-A:10, no contract of annuity, except as stated in RSA 409-A:2, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the contract holder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, the company will grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in RSA 409-A:5, 409-A:6, 409-A:7, 409-A:8 and 409-A:9, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the company will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of such amount as is specified in RSA 409-A:5, 409-A:6, 409-A:8 and 409-A:9, I.  The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of such cash surrender benefit for a period of 6 months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which such benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, any deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of 2 full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to such period would be less than $20 monthly, the company may at its option terminate such contract by payment in cash of the then present value of such portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by such payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under such contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any contract which does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.

<center><h3>Section 409-A:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:4 Minimum Nonforfeiture Amounts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The minimum values as specified in RSA 409-A:5, 409-A:6, 409-A:7, 409-A:8 and 409-A:9, I of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to such time at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph III of the net considerations, paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of subparagraphs (a) through (d):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph III;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph III;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any premium tax paid by the company for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph III;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount equal to 87 1/2 percent of the gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of 3 percent per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The 5-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest  1/20th of one percent, specified in the contract no longer than 15 months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under subparagraph III(d);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Reduced by 125 basis points;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Where the resulting interest rate is not less than one percent;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods.  The redetermination date, basis, and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract.  The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the 5-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate to be used at each redetermination date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in subparagraph III(b) by up to an additional 100 basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit.  The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit.  The commissioner may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit.  Lacking such a demonstration that is acceptable to the commissioner, the commissioner may disallow or limit the additional reduction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, as necessary to implement the provisions of paragraph IV and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts that the commissioner determines adjustments are justified.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:5 Computation of Annuity Benefit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date.  Such present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:6 Computation of Cash Surrender Benefits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For contracts which provide cash surrender benefits, such cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit which would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, such present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract.  In no event shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.  The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:7 Computation of Paid-up Annuity Nonforfeiture Benefits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, such present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract.  For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, such present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit.  However, in no event shall the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:8 Determination of Maturity Date. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under RSA 409-A:6 and 409-A:7, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be permitted by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant's seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:9 Calculations of Values;  Supplemental Rules. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For any contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 409-A:5, 409-A:6, 409-A:7, 409-A:8 and 409-A:9, I, additional benefits payable (a) in the event of total and permanent disability, (b) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or (c) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this chapter.  The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless such additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.
