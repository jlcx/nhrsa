&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409-A:3 Compulsory Contract Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of contracts issued on or after the operative date of this chapter as defined in RSA 409-A:10, no contract of annuity, except as stated in RSA 409-A:2, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the contract holder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, the company will grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in RSA 409-A:5, 409-A:6, 409-A:7, 409-A:8 and 409-A:9, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the company will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of such amount as is specified in RSA 409-A:5, 409-A:6, 409-A:8 and 409-A:9, I.  The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of such cash surrender benefit for a period of 6 months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which such benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, any deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of 2 full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to such period would be less than $20 monthly, the company may at its option terminate such contract by payment in cash of the then present value of such portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by such payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under such contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any contract which does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.
