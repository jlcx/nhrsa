I. All records required to be maintained under this chapter shall be kept in a location that will allow the records to be produced for examination within the time period required.  When, under normal circumstances, someone other than the insurer maintains a required record or type of record, the other person's responsibility to maintain the records shall be set forth in a written agreement, a copy of which shall be maintained by the insurer and shall be available to the examiners for purposes of examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If required by law or otherwise available, the insurer shall maintain disaster preparedness or disaster recovery procedures that include provisions for the maintenance or reconstruction of original or duplicate records at another location.  These procedures shall be provided for review during the examination.
