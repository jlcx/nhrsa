<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth standards and procedures for not-for-profit private and public institutions of higher education which provide 4 year bachelor's degree programs and graduate or professional degree programs, and which have a history of providing for the health insurance needs of their students by implementing self-funded student health benefit plans, to obtain authorization to continue this practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This chapter shall apply only to self-funded student health benefit plans, not to fully-insured student major medical expense coverage, which is governed by RSA 415:19-a and other applicable provisions of Title XXXVII.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an educational institution from purchasing fully-insured student health coverage offered pursuant to RSA 415:19-a.
