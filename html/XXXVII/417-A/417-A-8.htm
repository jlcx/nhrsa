&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417-A:8 Review Procedure;  Termination of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
On receipt of a request for review, the insurance commissioner or designated representative shall notify the insurer thereof and shall review the matter to determine whether the cancellation or refusal to renew or to write was in violation of this chapter, and shall within 60 days of the receipt of such request either order the policy written or reinstated or uphold the cancellation or refusal to renew.  In the case of a cancellation of or refusal to renew a policy, such policy shall remain in effect until the conclusion of such review by the insurance commissioner or the date referred to in RSA 417-A:5, II, whichever is later, except for appeals from cancellations due to nonpayment of premiums, in which case the policy shall terminate as of the date provided in the notice under RSA 417-A:5, II unless the appeal is upheld or the policy reinstated.
