&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person or provider may solicit funds, accept payments of any kind, or otherwise engage in providing any form of continuing care without a certificate of authority issued under this chapter.  An application for a certificate shall include the proposed disclosure statement required under RSA 420-D:4 and in addition to any other state or federal licensure or certification which may be required, a statement indicating that all of the requirements under this chapter have been met.  The commissioner shall take prompt action on requests for a certificate and shall, within a reasonable time, issue a certificate or a written rejection.  If he rejects an application, he may do so outright or state the conditions which must be met before a certificate shall be issued.  The applicant may request reconsideration and shall be granted a hearing in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner.  Certificates issued under this section shall continue in effect until revoked by the commissioner or until sale or transfer of management control to another owner or provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Continuing care facilities which reported to or were under the supervision of the director of charitable trusts of the department of justice under RSA 7:19 through 32-a on January 1, 1989, shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter.  However, any such facility may elect by a one-time irrevocable election to be subject to the provisions of this chapter by filing an application for a permanent certificate of authority with the commissioner.
