<codesect>
All records and assets of a provider shall be established and kept in the state of New Hampshire and shall not be removed from this state by a provider or his agent unless agreed to in writing by the commissioner prior to such removal.  The commissioner shall consent to such removal only if the provider submits satisfactory evidence that the removal will facilitate a more economical operation and will not diminish the service or protection given to the residents remaining in this state.  The commissioner may order the return of the records and assets if such return is in the best interests of the residents or of the state.
