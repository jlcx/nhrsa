<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Be deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.

The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account.  Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than 30 days before it is due.  No member insurer may be assessed in any year an amount greater than 2 percent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year on all kinds of insurance written by the insolvent insurer which are covered by the scope of this chapter.  If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available shall be pro rated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available.  The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance.  Each member insurer may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by the member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Investigate claims brought against the association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the association's obligation and deny all other claims and may review settlements, releases and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which such settlements, releases and judgments may be properly contested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notify such persons as the commissioner directs under RSA 404-B:10, II(a).

At the conclusion of the association's responsibility with respect to any insolvent insurer, any original records of said insolvent insurer then in the possession of the association shall be turned over to the liquidator for ultimate disposal in accordance with RSA 402-C.
