There is created a nonprofit unincorporated legal entity to be known as the New Hampshire Insurance Guaranty Association.

The association shall perform its functions under a plan of operation established and approved under RSA 404-B:9 and shall exercise its powers through a board of directors established under RSA 404-B:7.  For purposes of administration and assessment, the association shall be divided into 3 separate accounts:  (a) the workmen's compensation insurance account;  (b) the automobile insurance account;  and (c) the account for all other insurance to which this chapter applies.

<center><h3>Section 404-B:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-B:8 Powers and Duties of the Association. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The association shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Be obligated to the extent of the covered claims existing prior to the determination of insolvency and arising within 30 days after the determination of insolvency, or before the policy expiration date if less than 30 days after the determination, or before the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if he does so within 30 days of the determination, but such obligation shall include only that amount of each covered claim which is less than $300,000 except that the association shall pay the full amount of any covered claim arising out of a workmen's compensation policy, provided however RSA 281-A:37 shall not apply to payments or settlements made pursuant to this chapter.  In no event shall the association be obligated to a policyholder or claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy from which the claim arises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Be deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the 3 accounts separately, and assess member insurers separately for each account amounts necessary to pay the obligations of the association under paragraph I(a) subsequent to an insolvency, the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, the cost of examinations under RSA 404-B:13 and other expenses authorized by this chapter.  The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account.  Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than 30 days before it is due.  No member insurer may be assessed in any year an amount greater than 2 percent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year on all kinds of insurance written by the insolvent insurer which are covered by the scope of this chapter.  If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available shall be pro rated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available.  The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance.  Each member insurer may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by the member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Investigate claims brought against the association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the association's obligation and deny all other claims and may review settlements, releases and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which such settlements, releases and judgments may be properly contested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notify such persons as the commissioner directs under RSA 404-B:10, II(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities.  Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of the commissioner, but such designation may be declined by a member insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and shall pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Notwithstanding any of the powers of the commissioner or liquidator as provided for in RSA 402-C, the association shall have the final authority with respect to the processing and settlement of covered claims for which it becomes responsible pursuant to this chapter, including authority for the use of records of the insolvent insurer directly related to covered claims.  At the conclusion of the association's responsibility with respect to any insolvent insurer, any original records of said insolvent insurer then in the possession of the association shall be turned over to the liquidator for ultimate disposal in accordance with RSA 402-C.  The association shall cooperate with any agent to the extent possible in identifying policyholders of the agent and the insolvent insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The association may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter in accord with the plan of operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Sue or be sued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account that amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities, if, at the end of any calendar year, the board of directors finds that the assets of the association in any account exceed the liabilities of that account as estimated by the board of directors for the coming year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-B:10 Duties and Powers of the Commissioner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Forward to the association a copy of any complaint seeking an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency against a member company at the same time such complaint is filed with a court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notify the association of the existence of an insolvent insurer not later than 3 days after he receives notice of the determination of the insolvency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the association with a statement of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Make available to the association as soon as practicable after receipt, but only after court approval, that fraction of any reinsurance treaty proceeds which are directly related to covered claims so that said funds may be used by the association for the prompt payment of said covered claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Require that the association notify the insureds of the insolvent insurer and any other interested parties of the determination of insolvency and of their rights under this chapter.  Such notification shall be by mail at their last known address, where available, but if sufficient information for notification by mail is not available, notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation shall be sufficient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.  As an alternative, the commissioner may levy a fine on any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due.  Such fine shall be paid to the association and shall not exceed 5 percent of the unpaid assessment per month, except that no fine shall be less than $100 per month.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Revoke the designation of any servicing facility if he finds claims are being handled unsatisfactorily.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person recovering under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned his rights under the policy to the association to the extent of his recovery from the association.  Every insured or claimant seeking the protection of this chapter shall cooperate with the association to the same extent as such person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer.  The association shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out except such causes of action as the insolvent insurer would have had if such sums had been paid by the insolvent insurer.  In the case of an insolvent insurer operating on a plan with assessment liability, payments of claims of the association shall not operate to reduce the liability of insureds to the receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor for unpaid assessments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlements of covered claims by the association or a similar organization in another state.  The court having jurisdiction shall grant such claims priority equal to that which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this chapter against the assets of the insolvent insurer.  The expenses of the association or similar organization in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the liquidator's expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The association shall periodically file with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the association and estimates of anticipated claims on the association which shall preserve the rights of the association against the assets of the insolvent insurer.

Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under such insurance policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person having a claim which may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall seek recovery first from the association of the place of residence of the insured except that if it is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he shall seek recovery first from the association of the location of the property, and if it is a workmen's compensation claim, he shall seek recovery first from the association of the residence of the claimant.  Any recovery under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent.

<codesect>
To aid in the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be the duty of the board of directors, upon majority vote, to notify the commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, request that the commissioner order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public.  Within 30 days of the receipt of such request, the commissioner shall begin such examination.  The examination may be conducted as a National Association of Insurance Commissioners examination or may be conducted by such persons as the commissioner designates.  The cost of such examination shall be paid by the association and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports.  In no event shall such examination report be released to the board of directors prior to its release to the public, but this shall not preclude the commissioner from complying with paragraph III.  The commissioner shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed.  The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the commissioner but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It shall be the duty of the commissioner to report to the board of directors when he has reasonable cause to believe that any member insurer examined or being examined at the request of the board of directors may be insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make reports and recommendations to the commissioner upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member insurer.  Such reports and recommendations shall not be considered public documents.

All proceedings in which the insolvent insurer is a party or is obligated to defend a party in any court in this state shall be stayed for 6 months and any additional time thereafter as may be determined by the court from the date the insolvency is determined or an ancillary proceeding is instituted in this state, whichever is later, to permit proper defense by the association of all pending causes of action.  As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision, verdict or finding based on the default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to defend an insured, the association either on its own behalf or on behalf of such insured may apply to have such judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that made such judgment, order, decision, verdict or finding and shall be permitted to defend against such claim on the merits.
