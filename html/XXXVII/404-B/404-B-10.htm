&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-B:10 Duties and Powers of the Commissioner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Forward to the association a copy of any complaint seeking an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency against a member company at the same time such complaint is filed with a court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notify the association of the existence of an insolvent insurer not later than 3 days after he receives notice of the determination of the insolvency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the association with a statement of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Make available to the association as soon as practicable after receipt, but only after court approval, that fraction of any reinsurance treaty proceeds which are directly related to covered claims so that said funds may be used by the association for the prompt payment of said covered claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Require that the association notify the insureds of the insolvent insurer and any other interested parties of the determination of insolvency and of their rights under this chapter.  Such notification shall be by mail at their last known address, where available, but if sufficient information for notification by mail is not available, notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation shall be sufficient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.  As an alternative, the commissioner may levy a fine on any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due.  Such fine shall be paid to the association and shall not exceed 5 percent of the unpaid assessment per month, except that no fine shall be less than $100 per month.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Revoke the designation of any servicing facility if he finds claims are being handled unsatisfactorily.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon request of the association, hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, administer oaths, examine any person under oath and compel any person to subscribe to his testimony after it has been correctly reduced to writing, and in connection with such hearings require the production of any books, papers, records, or other documents which he deems relevant to the inquiry conducted by said association with respect to covered claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any final action or order of the commissioner under this chapter shall be subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction.
