&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Documents, materials, or other information, including the CGAD, in the possession or control of the insurance department that are obtained by, created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person under this chapter are recognized by this state as being proprietary and to contain trade secrets.  All such documents, materials, or other information shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to RSA 91-A, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action.  However, the commissioner is authorized to use the documents, materials, or other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make the documents, materials, or other information public without the prior written consent of the insurer.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require written consent of the insurer before the commissioner may share or receive confidential documents, materials, or other CGAD-related information pursuant to paragraph III to assist in the performance of the commissioner's regular duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Neither the commissioner nor any person who received documents, materials, or other CGAD-related information, through examination or otherwise, while acting under the authority of the commissioner, or with whom such documents, materials, or other information are shared pursuant to this chapter shall be permitted or required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential documents, materials, or information subject to paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) May, upon request, share documents, materials, or other CGAD-related information, including the confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information subject to paragraph I, including proprietary and trade secret documents and materials with other state, federal, and international financial regulatory agencies, including members of any supervisory college, as defined in RSA 401-B:7, with the NAIC, and with third party consultants pursuant to RSA 401-D:7;  provided, that the recipient agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the CGAD-related documents, materials, or other information and has verified in writing the legal authority to maintain confidentiality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) May receive documents, materials, or other CGAD-related information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, including proprietary and trade secret information or documents, from regulatory officials of other state, federal, and international financial regulatory agencies, including members of any supervisory college as defined in RSA 401-B:7, and from the NAIC, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any documents, materials, or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material, or information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The sharing of information and documents by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or rulemaking, and the commissioner is solely responsible for the administration, execution, and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, proprietary and trade secret materials, or other CGAD-related information shall occur as a result of disclosure of such CGAD-related information or documents to the commissioner under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in this chapter.
