I. The purpose of this chapter is to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide the insurance commissioner with a summary of an insurer or insurance group's corporate governance structure, policies and practices to permit the commissioner to gain and maintain an understanding of the insurer's corporate governance framework.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Outline the requirements for completing a corporate governance annual disclosure with the insurance commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide for the financial treatment of the corporate governance annual disclosure and related information that will contain confidential and sensitive information related to an insurer or insurance group's internal operations and proprietary and trade secret information which, if made public, could potentially cause the insurer or insurance group competitive harm or disadvantage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prescribe or impose corporate governance standards and internal procedures beyond that which is required under applicable state corporate law.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority, or the rights or obligations of third parties, under RSA 400-A:37.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
