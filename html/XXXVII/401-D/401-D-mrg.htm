<br><center>[RSA 401-D:3 effective January 1, 2017.]</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 401-D:3 Disclosure Requirement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An insurer, or the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, shall, no later than June 1 of each calendar year, submit to the commissioner a CGAD that contains the information described in RSA 401-D:5.  Notwithstanding a request from the commissioner made pursuant to paragraph III, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required by this section to the commissioner of the lead state for the insurance group, in accordance with the laws of the lead state, as determined by the procedures outlined in the most recent financial analysis handbook adopted by the NAIC.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The CGAD shall include a signature of the insurer or insurance group's chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of that individual's belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee of such board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An insurer not required to submit a CGAD under this section shall do so upon the commissioner's request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For purposes of completing the CGAD, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level, and/or the individual legal entity level, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance.  The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make CGAD disclosures at the level at which the insurer's or insurance group's risk appetite is determined, or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed.  If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the 3 criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in the level of reporting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The review of the CGAD and any additional requests for information shall be made through the lead state as determined by the procedures within the most recent financial analysis handbook referenced in paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Insurers providing information substantially similar to the information required by this chapter in other documents provided to the commissioner, including proxy statements filed in conjunction with Form B requirements, or other state or federal filings provided to the department shall not be required to duplicate that information in the CGAD, but shall only be required to cross reference the document in which the information is included.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Documents, materials, or other information, including the CGAD, in the possession or control of the insurance department that are obtained by, created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person under this chapter are recognized by this state as being proprietary and to contain trade secrets.  All such documents, materials, or other information shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to RSA 91-A, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action.  However, the commissioner is authorized to use the documents, materials, or other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make the documents, materials, or other information public without the prior written consent of the insurer.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require written consent of the insurer before the commissioner may share or receive confidential documents, materials, or other CGAD-related information pursuant to paragraph III to assist in the performance of the commissioner's regular duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Neither the commissioner nor any person who received documents, materials, or other CGAD-related information, through examination or otherwise, while acting under the authority of the commissioner, or with whom such documents, materials, or other information are shared pursuant to this chapter shall be permitted or required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential documents, materials, or information subject to paragraph I.

(b) May receive documents, materials, or other CGAD-related information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, including proprietary and trade secret information or documents, from regulatory officials of other state, federal, and international financial regulatory agencies, including members of any supervisory college as defined in RSA 401-B:7, and from the NAIC, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any documents, materials, or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material, or information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The sharing of information and documents by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or rulemaking, and the commissioner is solely responsible for the administration, execution, and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, proprietary and trade secret materials, or other CGAD-related information shall occur as a result of disclosure of such CGAD-related information or documents to the commissioner under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in this chapter.
