&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 407-B:2 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following words, as used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires or a different meaning is specifically prescribed, shall have the following meanings:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Group Motor Vehicle Insurance Defined.  All motor vehicle insurance which is offered by a licensed insurer in this state on a group merchandising plan to an eligible group as herein defined shall be deemed group motor vehicle insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Group Merchandising Defined.  The marketing of group motor vehicle insurance by a licensed insurer otherwise engaged in insuring independent individual risks, to an eligible group on a guaranteed basis under a single insurance program, without individual underwriting selection or individual proof of insurability, shall be deemed group merchandising.  This method of marketing insurance is generally referred to as "mass merchandising,'' "franchise merchandising,'' or "collective merchandising'';  but for purposes of this section shall hereinafter be only referred to as "group merchandising'' or the "group plan'' as herein defined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Eligible Group Defined.  Any group to be eligible for group merchandising shall have been in existence for more than 5 years prior to the purchase of such insurance, and shall not have been organized solely for the purpose of purchasing insurance.  Such group shall have a high degree of homogeneity and may include members of unincorporated and corporated associations, labor unions, employees of a common employer and similar principal agent relationships.  No group will be eligible unless it consists of 500 or more members with at least 75 percent participation in the group plan.  Where the group has national or other affiliates, only the members located in the state of New Hampshire shall be considered in determining the number and percentage of individuals necessary for establishing group eligibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Eligible Members Defined.  Eligible members shall include all members in good standing in the group provided employees shall be engaged in at least 24 hours employment per week, except as otherwise provided in RSA 407-B:4.  Officers and directors of an eligible group and individual proprietors and partners shall be eligible for a group plan and as such may be considered as employees.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 407-B:3 General Conditions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Group motor vehicle insurance may be issued in this state provided the following conditions are complied with:

I. Mandatory participation in the group plan shall not be required as a condition of employment, nor shall any member not participating in the plan be coerced or discriminated against.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The insurer and the group insured must accept all members or employees who are eligible and wish to participate in the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Such a group plan shall include a provision that any member of the group shall have the right to convert his group policy to an individual standard policy of insurance in the same company as offered by the insurer to the non-group insureds upon termination of his connection with the group extending to him the same limits of coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. To qualify to write the group insurance herein defined, an insurer must also be engaged in the business of writing the type of coverage offered for insureds other than group and may not be organized solely for the purpose of furnishing coverage to such groups.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Each member of the group must be issued the same form of policy as approved for issue in this state varying only as to the amounts of insurance and limits of liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. An insurer may not cancel the insurance of an individual member of the group except for the non-payment of premium by such member or unless the insurance for the entire group is cancelled.  In such cases notice of cancellation as provided in like non-group policies shall be given to each member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The plan shall provide that only those motor vehicles owned by members of the group or their spouses or children, jointly or severally, shall be eligible for coverage.
