<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Disallowance for Failure to Surrender Property.  No claims of a creditor who has received or acquired a preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment or encumbrance, voidable under this chapter, shall be allowed unless he surrenders the preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment or encumbrance.  If the avoidance is effected by a proceeding in which a final judgment has been entered, the claim shall not be allowed unless the money is paid or the property is delivered to the liquidator within 30 days from the date of the entering of the final judgment, except that the court having jurisdiction over the liquidation may allow further time if there is an appeal or other continuation of the proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Time for Filing.  A claim allowable under paragraph I by reason of the avoidance, whether voluntary or involuntary, of a preference lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment or encumbrance may be filed as an excused late filing under RSA 402-C:37 if filed within 30 days from the date of the avoidance or within the further time allowed by the court under paragraph I.
