I. Transformation to Liquidation.  Whenever he believes that further attempts to rehabilitate an insurer would substantially increase the risk of loss to creditors, policyholders, or the public, or would be futile, the rehabilitator may petition the court for an order of liquidation.  A petition under this subsection shall have the same effect as a petition under RSA 402-C:20.  The court shall permit the directors to defend against the petition and shall order payment from the estate of the insurer of such costs and other expenses of defense as justice requires.

II. Order to Return to Company.  The rehabilitator may at any time petition the court for an order terminating rehabilitation of an insurer.  If the court finds that rehabilitation has been accomplished and that grounds for rehabilitation under RSA 402-C:15 no longer exist, it shall order that the insurer be restored to possession of its property and the control of its business.  The court may also make that finding and issue that order at any time upon its own motion.
