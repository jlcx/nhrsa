<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Special Deputy Commissioner.  The commissioner as rehabilitator shall make every reasonable effort to employ an active or retired senior executive from a successful insurer to serve as special deputy commissioner to rehabilitate the insurer.  The special deputy shall have all of the powers of the rehabilitator granted under this section.  To obtain a suitable special deputy, the commissioner may consult with and obtain the assistance and advice of executives of insurers doing business in this state.  Subject to court approval, the commissioner shall make such arrangements for compensation as are necessary to obtain a special deputy of proven ability.  The special deputy shall serve at the pleasure of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. General Power.  Subject to court approval, the rehabilitator may take such action as he deems necessary or expedient to reform and revitalize the insurer.  He shall have all the powers of the officers and managers, whose authority shall be suspended, except as they are redelegated by the rehabilitator.  He shall have full power to direct and manage, to hire and discharge employees subject to any contract rights they may have and to deal with the property and business of the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Advice From Experts.  The rehabilitator may consult with and obtain formal or informal advice and aid of insurance experts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Pursuit of Insurer's Claims Against Insiders.  If the rehabilitator finds that there has been criminal or tortious conduct or breach of any contractual or fiduciary obligation detrimental to the insurer by any officer, manager, agent, broker, employee or other person, he may pursue all appropriate legal remedies on behalf of the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Reorganization Plan.  The rehabilitator may prepare a plan for the reorganization, consolidation, conversion, reinsurance, merger or other transformation of the insurer.  Upon application of the rehabilitator for approval of the plan, and after such notice and hearing as the court prescribes, the court may either approve or disapprove the plan proposed, or may modify it and approve it as modified.  If it is approved, the rehabilitator shall carry out the plan.  In the case of a life insurer, the plan proposed may include the imposition of liens upon the equities of policyholders of the company, if all rights of shareholders are first relinquished.  A plan for a life insurer may also propose imposition of a moratorium upon loan and cash surrender rights under policies, for such period and to such an extent as are necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Fraudulent Transfers.  The rehabilitator shall have the power to avoid fraudulent transfers under RSA 402-C:30 and 31.
