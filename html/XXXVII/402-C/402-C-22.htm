<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All insurance policies issued by the insurer shall continue in force:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For a period of 30 days from the date of entry of the liquidation order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Until the normal expiration of the policy coverage;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Until the insured has replaced the insurance coverage with equivalent insurance in another insurer;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Until the liquidator has effected a transfer of the policy obligation pursuant to RSA 402-C:25, VIII;  whichever time is less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the coverage continued under this section is replaced by insurance that is not equivalent, the coverage continued under this section shall be excess coverage over the replacement policy to the extent of the deficiency.  Claims arising during the continuation of coverage shall be treated as if they arose immediately before the petition for liquidation.  Coverage under this section shall not satisfy any legal obligation of the insured to carry insurance protection, whether the obligation is created by law or by contract.
