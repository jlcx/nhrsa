&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 402-C:45 Liquidator's Recommendations to the Court. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Recommended Claims.  The liquidator shall review all claims duly filed in the liquidation and shall make such further investigation as he deems necessary.  He may compound, compromise or in any other manner negotiate the amount for which claims will be recommended to the court.  Unresolved disputes shall be determined under RSA 402-C:41.  As often as practicable, he shall present to the court reports of claims against the insurer with his recommendations.  The reports shall include the name and address of each claimant, the particulars of the claim and the amount of the claim finally recommended, if any.  As soon as reasonably possible after the last day for filing claims, he shall present a list of all claims not already reported.  If the insurer has issued annuities or life insurance policies, the liquidator shall report the persons to whom, according to the records of the insurer, amounts are owed as cash surrender values or other investment values and the amounts owed.  If the insurer has issued policies on the advance premium plan, the liquidator shall report the persons to whom, according to the records of the insurer, unearned premiums are owed and the amounts owed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Allowance of Claims.  The court may approve, disapprove or modify any report on claims by the liquidator, except that the liquidator's agreements with other parties shall be final and binding on the court on claims settled for $500 or less.  No claim under a policy of insurance shall be allowed for an amount in excess of the applicable policy limits.
