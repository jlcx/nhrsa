Whether or not the third party files a claim, the insured may file a claim on his own behalf in the liquidation.  If the insured fails to file a claim by the date for filing claims specified in the order of liquidation or within 60 days after mailing of the notice required by subparagraph (b) of RSA 402-C:26, I, whichever is later, he is an unexcused late filer.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII.

The liquidator shall make his recommendations to the court under RSA 402-C:45 for the allowance of an insured's claim under paragraph II after consideration of the probable outcome of any pending action against the insured on which the claim is based, the probable damages recoverable in the action and the probable costs and expenses of defense.  After allowance by the court, the liquidator shall withhold any dividends payable on the claim, pending the outcome of litigation and negotiation with the insured.  Whenever it seems appropriate, he shall reconsider the claim on the basis of additional information and amend his recommendations to the court.  The insured shall be afforded the same notice and opportunity to be heard on all changes in the recommendation as in its initial determination.  The court may amend its allowance as it thinks appropriate.  As claims against the insured are settled or barred, the insured shall be paid from the amount withheld the same percentage dividend as was paid on other claims of like priority, based on the lesser of a) the amount actually recovered from the insured by action or paid by agreement plus the reasonable costs and expenses of defense, or b) the amount allowed on the claims by the court.

Claims by the insured shall be evaluated as in paragraph III.

If the insured fails to file a claim by the date for filing claims specified in the order of liquidation or within 60 days after mailing of the notice required by subparagraph (b) of RSA 402-C:26, I, whichever is later, he is an unexcused late filer.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Procedure for Insured's Claim.  The liquidator shall make his recommendations to the court under RSA 402-C:45 for the allowance of an insured's claim under paragraph II after consideration of the probable outcome of any pending action against the insured on which the claim is based, the probable damages recoverable in the action and the probable costs and expenses of defense.

IV. Multiple Claims.  If several claims founded upon one policy are filed, whether by third parties or as claims by the insured under this section, and the aggregate allowed amount of the claims to which the same limit of liability in the policy is applicable exceeds that limit, each claim as allowed shall be reduced in the same proportion so that the total equals the policy limit.
