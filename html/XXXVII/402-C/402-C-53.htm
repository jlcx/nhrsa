If no domiciliary receiver has been appointed, the commissioner may apply to the superior court for Merrimack county by verified petition for an order directing him to liquidate the assets found in this state of a foreign insurer or an alien insurer not domiciled in this state, on any of the following grounds:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Any of the grounds in RSA 402-C:15;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) Any of the grounds in RSA 402-C:20;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Any of the grounds in RSA 402-C:52.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Terms of Order.  If it appears to the court that the best interests of creditors, policyholders and the public so require, the court may issue an order to liquidate in whatever terms it deems appropriate.  The filing or recording of the order with any register of deeds in this state imparts the same notice as a deed, bill of sale or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded with that register of deeds.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Conversion to Ancillary Proceeding.  If a domiciliary liquidator is appointed in a reciprocal state while a liquidation is proceeding under this section, the liquidator under this section shall thereafter act as ancillary receiver under RSA 402-C:55.

On the same grounds as are specified in paragraph I, the commissioner may petition any appropriate federal district court to be appointed receiver to liquidate that portion of the insurer's assets and business over which the court will exercise jurisdiction, or any lesser part thereof that the commissioner deems desirable for the protection of the policyholders and creditors in this state.  The commissioner may accept appointment as federal receiver if another person files a petition.">
