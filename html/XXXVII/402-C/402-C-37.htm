I. Deadline for Filing.  Proof of all claims must be filed with the liquidator in the form required by RSA 402-C:38 on or before the last day for filing specified in the notice required under RSA 402-C:26, except that proof of preferred ownership claims and proprietary claims under RSA 402-C:44 need not be filed at all, and proof of claims for cash surrender values or other investment values in life insurance and annuities need not be filed unless the liquidator expressly so requires.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Excused Late Filings.  For a good cause shown, the liquidator shall recommend and the court shall permit a claimant making a late filing to share in dividends, whether past or future, as if he were not late, to the extent that any such payment will not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation.  Good cause includes but is not limited to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That existence of a claim was not known to the claimant and that he filed within 30 days after he learned of it;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That a claim for cash surrender values or other investment values in life insurance or annuities which was not required to be filed was omitted from the liquidator's recommendations to the court under RSA 402-C:45, and that it was filed within 30 days after the claimant learned of the omission;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That a transfer to creditor was avoided under RSA 402-C:30-32 or was voluntarily surrendered under RSA 402-C:33, and that the filing satisfies the conditions of RSA 402-C:33;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That valuation under RSA 402-C:43 of security held by a secured creditor shows a deficiency, which is filed within 30 days after the valuation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) That a claim was contingent and became absolute, and was filed within 30 days after it became absolute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unexcused Late Filings.  The liquidator may consider any claim filed late which is not covered by paragraph II, and permit it to receive dividends, other than the first dividend, which are subsequently declared on any claims of the same or lower priority if the payment does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation.  The late-filing claimant shall receive, at each distribution, the same percentage of the amount allowed on his claim as is then being paid to other claimants of the same priority plus the same percentage of the amount allowed on his claim as is then being paid to claimants of any lower priority.  This shall continue until his claim has been paid in full.
