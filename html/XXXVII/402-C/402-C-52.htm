<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Grounds for Petition.  If a domiciliary liquidator has not been appointed, the commissioner may apply to the superior court for Merrimack county by verified petition for an order directing him to conserve the property of an alien insurer not domiciled in this state or a foreign insurer on any one or more of the following grounds:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any of the grounds in RSA 402-C:15;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any of the grounds in RSA 402-C:20;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That any of its property has been sequestered by official action in its domiciliary state, or in any other state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That enough of its property has been sequestered in a foreign country to give reasonable cause to fear that the insurer is or may become insolvent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) That 1) its certificate of authority to do business in this state has been revoked or that none was ever issued, and 2) there are residents of this state with outstanding claims or outstanding policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Terms of Order.  The court may issue the order in whatever terms it deems appropriate.  The filing or recording of the order with any register of deeds in this state imparts the same notice as a deed, bill of sale or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded with that register of deeds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Transformation to Liquidation or Ancillary Receivership.  The conservator may at any time petition for and the court may grant an order under RSA 402-C:53 to liquidate the assets of a foreign or alien insurer under conservation or, if appropriate, for an order under RSA 402-C:55 to be appointed ancillary receiver.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Order to Return to Company.  The conservator may at any time petition the court for an order, terminating conservation of an insurer.  If the court finds that the conservation is no longer necessary, it shall order that the insurer be restored to possession of its property and the control of its business.  The court may also make such finding and issue such order at any time upon its own motion.
