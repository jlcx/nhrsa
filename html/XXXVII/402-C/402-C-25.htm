<center><h3>Section 402-C:25</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 402-C:25 Powers of Liquidator. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The liquidator shall report to the court monthly, or at other intervals specified by the court, on the progress of the liquidation in whatever detail the court orders.  Subject to the court's control, he may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Appoint a special deputy to act for him under this chapter, and determine his compensation.  The special deputy shall have all powers of the liquidator granted by this section.  The special deputy shall serve at the pleasure of the liquidator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Appoint or engage employees and agents, legal counsel, actuaries, accountants, appraisers, consultants and other personnel he deems necessary to assist in the liquidation.  RSA 98 shall not apply to such persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Fix the compensation of persons under paragraph II, subject to the control of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Defray all expenses of taking possession of, conserving, conducting, liquidating, disposing of or otherwise dealing with the business and property of the insurer.  If the property of the insurer does not contain sufficient cash or liquid assets to defray the costs incurred, the liquidator may advance the costs so incurred out of any available appropriation.  Any amounts so paid shall be deemed expense of administration and shall be repaid for the credit of the insurance department out of the first available moneys of the insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, administer oaths, examine any person under oath and compel any person to subscribe to his testimony after it has been correctly reduced to writing, and in connection therewith require the production of any books, papers, records or other documents which he deems relevant to the inquiry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Collect all debts and moneys due and claims belonging to the insurer, wherever located, and for this purpose institute timely action in other jurisdictions, in order to forestall garnishment and attachment proceedings against such debts;  do such other acts as are necessary or expedient to collect, conserve or protect its assets or property, including sell, compound, compromise or assign for purposes of collection, upon such terms and conditions as he deems best, any bad or doubtful debts;  and pursue any creditor's remedies available to enforce his claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Conduct public and private sales of the property of the insurer in a manner prescribed by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Use assets of the estate to transfer policy obligations to a solvent assuming insurer, if the transfer can be arranged without prejudice to applicable priorities under RSA 402-C:44.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Acquire, hypothecate, encumber, lease, improve, sell, transfer, abandon or otherwise dispose of or deal with any property of the insurer at its market value or upon such terms and conditions as are fair and reasonable, except that no transaction involving property the market value of which exceeds $10,000 shall be concluded without express permission of the court.  He also may execute, acknowledge and deliver any deeds, assignments, releases and other instruments necessary or proper to effectuate any sale of property or other transaction in connection with the liquidation.  In cases where real property sold by the liquidator is located other than in the county where the liquidation is pending, the liquidator shall cause to be filed with the register of deeds for the county in which the property is located a certified copy of the order appointing him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Borrow money on the security of the insurer's assets or without security and execute and deliver all documents necessary to that transaction for the purpose of facilitating the liquidation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Enter into such contracts as are necessary to carry out the order to liquidate, and affirm or disavow any contracts to which the insurer is a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Continue to prosecute and institute in the name of the insurer or in his own name any suits and other legal proceedings, in this state or elsewhere, and abandon the prosecution of claims he deems unprofitable to pursue further.  If the insurer is dissolved under RSA 402-C:23, he may apply to any court in this state or elsewhere for leave to substitute himself for the insurer as plaintiff.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Prosecute any action which may exist in behalf of the creditors, members, policyholders or shareholders of the insurer against any officer of the insurer, or any other person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Remove any records and property of the insurer to the offices of the commissioner or to such other place as is convenient for the purposes of efficient and orderly execution of the liquidation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. Deposit in one or more banks in this state such sums as are required for meeting current administration expenses and dividend distributions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. File any necessary documents for record in the office of any register of deeds or record office in this state or elsewhere where property of the insurer is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. Assert all legal and equitable defenses available to the insurer as against third persons.  A waiver of any defense by the insurer after a petition for liquidation has been filed shall not bind the liquidator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. Exercise and enforce all the rights, remedies and powers of any creditor, shareholder, policyholder or member, including any power to avoid any transfer or lien that may be given by law and that is not included within RSA 402-C:30-32.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIX. Intervene in any proceeding wherever instituted that might lead to the appointment of a receiver or trustee, and act as the receiver or trustee whenever the appointment is offered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XX. Enter into agreements with any receiver or commissioner of any other state relating to the rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation or dissolution of an insurer doing business in both states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXI. Exercise all powers now held or hereafter conferred upon receivers by the laws of this state not inconsistent with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXII. The enumeration in this section of the powers and authority of the liquidator is not a limitation upon him, nor does it exclude his right to do such other acts not herein specifically enumerated or otherwise provided for as are necessary or expedient for the accomplishment of or in aid of the purpose of liquidation.
