&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-F:5 Contracts With Contract Holders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every contract between Delta and a contract holder shall be in writing, a copy of which shall be furnished to the contract holder and shall contain the following provisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A statement of the amount payable to Delta by the contract holder and the manner in which such amount is payable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A statement of the nature and extent of the benefits to be provided, and if any benefits are to be limited or excepted, an enumeration of such limitations or exceptions shall be printed with the same prominence as the statement of benefits conferred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A statement of the terms and conditions upon which the contract may be cancelled or otherwise terminated at the option of either party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A statement that the contract includes endorsements and attached papers, if any, and that it comprises the entire contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A provision that no statement by the contract holder in its application for a contract shall void the contract or be used in any legal proceeding on the contract unless an exact copy of the application is included or attached to the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A statement of the grace period which will be allowed the contract holder for making any payment due under the contract.  Such period shall be not less than 10 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the coverage for dependent children includes coverage for dependent children who are full-time students, as defined by the appropriate educational institution, beyond the age of 18, such dependent coverage shall include coverage for a dependent's medically necessary leave of absence from school for a period not to exceed 12 months or the date on which coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy, whichever comes first.  Any breaks in the school semester shall not disqualify the dependent child from coverage under this paragraph.  Documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be submitted to the insurer by the student's attending physician and shall be considered prima facie evidence of entitlement to coverage under this paragraph.  The date of the documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be the date the insurance coverage under this paragraph commences.
