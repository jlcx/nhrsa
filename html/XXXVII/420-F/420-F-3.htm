&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-F:3 Agent License. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person, for himself or in behalf of any person, shall sell or offer to sell any Delta benefit plan, as is provided for in this chapter, without being licensed by the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of RSA 402-J.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon written notice by Delta of its appointment of a person to act as its agent, the commissioner shall issue, if he is first satisfied that the appointee is a suitable person and intends to hold himself out in good faith as an agent and upon payment of the proper fee by the applicant, to the appointee a license to act as such agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A license previously issued may be renewed upon the application of Delta upon payment of the proper fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner, at any time after granting such license, for cause shown and after notice and hearing, may determine such licensee to be unsuitable to act as such agent, and shall thereupon revoke such license and notify both Delta and the agent of such revocation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Unless revoked by the commissioner, or unless Delta by written notice to the commissioner cancels the agent's authority to act for it, such license issued to an agent, or any renewal thereof, shall expire on June 14 of the second year after its issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a person acts or aids in any manner in the negotiation of Delta contracts, or solicits or receives any application for such contracts, without a license from the commissioner, or if the license granted to him or her or Delta for whom he or she acts as agent has been revoked, he or she shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person;  but any contract issued on an application thus procured shall bind Delta if otherwise valid.  This paragraph shall not apply to any clerical employee of Delta, or to any persons rendering their services without compensation.
