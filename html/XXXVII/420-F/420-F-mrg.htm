In the event a carrier elects to provide coverage for dependent children, the term "dependent child'' shall include a subscriber's child by blood or by law, who is under age 26.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The coverage of any family member insured by such policy, pursuant to paragraph I, who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his or her own living as of the date on which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as such dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the policyholder or the employee or his or her estate is chargeable for the care of such dependent;  provided, that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G.

(b) The date upon which the employer under whose contract coverage is provided to a dependent ceases to provide coverage to the subscriber.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a health insurance carrier to refuse an election for coverage by a dependent pursuant to paragraph III, based upon the dependent's prior disqualification pursuant to subparagraph IV(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Notice regarding coverage for a dependent as provided pursuant to this section shall be provided to a subscriber:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
