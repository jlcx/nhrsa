In addition to duties and powers enumerated elsewhere in this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall upon request of the board of directors, serve a demand upon the member insurer to pay an assessment within a reasonable time;  the failure of the member insurer to promptly comply with such demand shall not excuse the association from the performance of its powers and duties under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The commissioner shall annually review the report required under RSA 404-G:4-a on association membership, covered lives, and the payment of assessments to ensure that all insurers that should be members of the association are participating in the association and that all association members have accurately reported covered lives and paid the proper assessment.  The association shall remedy any problem identified by the commissioner with respect to membership in the association, reporting of covered lives, or payment of the assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.  As an alternative, the commissioner may levy a forfeiture on any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due.  Such forfeiture shall not exceed 5 percent of the unpaid assessment per month, but no forfeiture shall be less than $100 per month.  Any amounts so collected shall be credited to the assessment fund administered by the association.
<br>

III. Any action of the board of directors or the association may be appealed to the commissioner by any member insurer if the appeal is taken within 30 days of the final action being appealed.  If a member company is appealing an assessment, the amount assessed shall be paid to the association and available to meet association obligations during the pendency of an appeal.  If the appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member company from available funds of the association.  Any final action or order of the commissioner shall be subject to judicial review, pursuant to RSA 541.
