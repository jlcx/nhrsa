<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The individual has applied to a carrier of individual health insurance for coverage that is substantially similar to the coverage that is available through the pool, and such application has been accepted, but at a premium rate exceeding the eligibility rate set by the association from time to time and submitted to the commissioner for approval with the premium rates, which eligibility rate shall not be less than 125 percent and shall not exceed 150 percent of the standard risk rate calculated pursuant to RSA 404-G:5-d, II;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The individual is an "eligible individual'' as defined in section 2741(b) of the Public Health Service Act;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The individual has been certified as eligible for either federal trade adjustment assistance or for pension benefit guarantee corporation, as prescribed by the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002 and the association, in accordance with procedures set forth in its plan of operation, is offering coverage in the high risk pool to such eligible persons at the time of the individual's application;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The individual has received an offer of coverage from a carrier of individual health insurance that contains a rider or endorsement excluding coverage for a specified condition pursuant to RSA 420-G:5, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The association shall promulgate a list of medical or health conditions for which a person shall be eligible for plan coverage without applying for health insurance coverage.  Persons who can demonstrate the existence or history of any medical or health conditions on the list promulgated by the association shall not be required to provide evidence of a notice of rejection or refusal.  The list shall be effective on the first day of the operation of the pool and may be amended from time to time as may be appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each resident dependent of a person who is eligible for pool coverage shall also be eligible for pool coverage.  If the primary insured is a child, resident family members shall also be eligible for pool coverage.
