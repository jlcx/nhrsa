<center><h3>Section 404-G:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-G:1 Purpose of Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Protect the citizens of this state who participate in the individual health insurance market by providing a mechanism to equitably distribute the excessive risk sometimes associated with this market and to enable insurers to better protect against the costs of covering high risk individuals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Create a nonprofit, voluntary organization to facilitate the availability of affordable individual nongroup health insurance by establishing an assessment mechanism and an individual health insurance market mandatory risk sharing plan as a mechanism to distribute the risks associated within the individual nongroup market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Establish a high risk pool that will provide access to health insurance to all residents of the state who are denied health insurance for medical or health reasons.  The premiums charged for coverage in the high risk pool shall be affordable and the coverage provided shall be reasonably comprehensive and comparable to coverage available outside of the high risk pool.  It is the intent of the legislature that the high risk pool shall be adequately funded through an annual, and if necessary, a special assessment mechanism, that the high risk pool shall utilize cost containment measures, including, but not limited to, providing network based coverage, and that measures shall be taken to avoid inappropriate shifting of costs and risk to the high risk pool.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Authorize the association to establish a federally qualified high risk pool pursuant to section 1101 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 (PL 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-152).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-G:1-a Study and Biannual Report. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
 The commissioner shall evaluate the impact and effectiveness of RSA 404-G in effectuating the principles outlined in RSA 404-G:1, III. This review shall be based on data collected from carriers in the individual market and from the association, including but not limited to the following data elements:  data on premiums and carrier profitability, carriers entering or exiting the market, products being sold, basis for high risk pool eligibility, and overall denial rate.  The study shall be completed within 6 months of the availability of data on the first 2 years of operation of the high risk pool.  Upon completion of the study, the commissioner shall make an initial report relative to the findings of the study to the governor, the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives and shall make biannual reports to such persons thereafter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-G:5 Plan of Operation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The board of directors of the association shall adopt a plan of operation which shall be the same plan of operation as that adopted pursuant to the order.  Any amendments to the current plan of operation shall be approved by the commissioner.  The plan of operation shall provide substantially the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Description of risks to be shared.  Sharing shall be implemented through a risk adjustment and subsidization mechanism whereby writers in the group market will subsidize losses of writers in the individual market.  The mechanism shall include parameters which will limit its costs and ensure proper claims management by the nongroup writers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Subsidy determination for the risk sharing mechanism.  For a given calendar year, the subsidy calculations for the risk sharing mechanism shall be based on the experience of the prior year.  Only individual health insurance writers who are actively marketing individual health insurance, in accordance with the provisions of RSA 420-G, during the calendar year in which the subsidy is distributed shall be eligible for a subsidy.  For companies that utilize health status factors, only individuals whose coverage is written at the maximum allowable health status factors under RSA 420-G and whose coverage was issued prior to July 1, 2002 shall be eligible for a subsidy.  For companies that do not utilize varied health status factors, all individuals whose coverage is written under RSA 420-G and whose coverage was issued prior to July 1, 2002 shall be eligible for a subsidy.  The subsidy determination process shall recognize and compensate writers based on the risk characteristics of coverage eligible for consideration in the subsidy relative to standards established by the association board.  Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the commissioner from approving a subsidy mechanism that fully compensates individual health insurers for all costs incurred on subsidy-eligible coverages in excess of the premiums collected from subsidy-eligible coverages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Assessment determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Assessment liabilities shall commence on the effective date of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Assessments shall be calculated based on the number of covered lives.  The number of covered lives shall be determined each month during the calendar year.  The assessment shall be calculated as the number of covered lives times a specified amount.  The specified amount shall be fixed throughout the calendar year and shall be determined by the board no later than the first day of November preceding the calendar year for which the amount is to be used.  The amount shall be subject to approval by the commissioner.  The board shall provide a basis for recommending the specified amount, including a projection of the calculated subsidy and consideration of any prior year shortfalls or overages.  For the calendar years 1999 and 2000, the specified amount shall be 18 cents per covered life per month, provided, however, that the board may petition the commissioner for approval of a greater specified amount.  The commissioner shall approve such amount if he or she finds, after consideration of the:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Board's subsidy determination process;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Number of subsidy-eligible lives;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Size of the entire non-group market;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Morbidity experience of the subsidy-eligible lives;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Morbidity experience of the entire non-group market;  that the amount petitioned by the board is no greater than is necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter.  For the purpose of making this determination, the commissioner may, at the expense of the association, seek independent actuarial certification of the need for the increase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each covered life should be included in the assessment only once.  The board shall adopt procedures by which affiliated carriers calculate their assessment on an aggregate basis and procedures to ensure that no covered life is counted more than once.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Administrative matters.  The plan of operation shall further provide for all of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Responsibility for the handling and accounting of funds and other assets of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The financial and other records required to be kept, including the annual report to be submitted to the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Such other administrative provisions as are necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the association.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-G:5-a Plan of Operation for the High Risk Pool. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board of directors for the association shall adopt a plan of operation for the high risk pool.  The high risk pool shall be funded in part through an assessment mechanism whereby writers of health insurance contribute an amount sufficient to cover the expenses and losses of the pool not covered by premiums.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The plan of operation for the high risk pool shall establish:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Procedures for handling and accounting for the assets and moneys of the plan;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Procedures for selecting and retaining a pool administrator;

The procedures shall ensure that utilization review determinations and grievances will be processed properly and in accordance with all statutory and regulatory requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The assessment for the high risk pool shall be based on the number of covered lives times a specified assessment rate.  The association shall specify the basis used to set the assessment rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The association shall establish a regular assessment rate which shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Calculated on a calendar year basis;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Established no later than November 1 in the year preceding the calendar year for which the carrier's experience shall be used to calculate the assessment;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Anticipated to be sufficient to meet the high risk pool's funding needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to the regular assessment rate, the association may establish a special assessment rate.  Notwithstanding RSA 420-G:4, a writer of health insurance may increase the premiums charged by the amount of the special assessment.  Any assessment may appear as a separate line item on a policyholder's bill.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The association shall only establish a special assessment if the association determines that its funds are or will become insufficient to pay the high risk pool's expenses in a timely manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The association shall only assess, through the special assessment, at a rate necessary to fund the deficiency ascertained in subparagraph (1) above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The regular assessment rate, and any special assessment rate, shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner.  The commissioner shall approve the rate if she or he finds that the amount is required to fulfill the purposes of the high risk pool.  For the purpose of making this determination, the commissioner may, at the expense of the association, seek independent actuarial certification of the need for the proposed rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The association shall impose and collect assessments from its members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If the assessment exceeds the amount actually needed, the excess shall be held and invested and, with the earnings and interest thereon, be used to offset future net losses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Each covered life should be included in the assessment only once.  The association shall adopt procedures by which affiliated carriers calculate their assessment on an aggregate basis and procedures to ensure that no covered life is counted more than once.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The initial assessment rate to fund the high risk pool shall be 60 cents per covered life per month, and shall take effect on policies or certificates issued or renewed on or after July 1, 2001.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 404-G:5-b High Risk Pool. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby created the New Hampshire high risk pool.  This pool shall operate subject to the supervision and control of the association and shall offer policies of insurance on or after July 1, 2002.  The pool shall offer health care coverage consisting of 4 benefit plans, 2 of which shall be either managed care or network based plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The plans to be issued by the pool, including schedules of benefits, exclusions and other limitations shall be established by the association subject to the approval of the commissioner.  In establishing the plans, the association shall take into consideration the levels of health insurance coverage provided in the state and medical economic factors as may be deemed appropriate and shall promulgate benefit levels, deductibles, coinsurance factors, exclusions and limitations determined to be generally reflective of and commensurate with comprehensive, major medical health insurance coverage provided in the state.  The association shall, utilizing standard morbidity assumptions, annually place a value on all plans presently being written or issued in the individual market.  The association shall average these values, weighed according to each plan's written premium volume, or some other suitable proxy, and utilizing the same standard morbidity assumptions, shall develop 2 coverage options:  Option A and Option B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The value of Option A developed by the association shall be 10 percent higher than the average value computed under paragraph II and the value of Option B shall be 10 percent lower than the average value computed under paragraph II. The association shall also provide either a managed care or network based version of Option A and a managed care version of Option B for a total of 4 plan choices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. The association, subject to the approval of the commissioner, may from time to time offer such plans, in addition to the 4 plans required under paragraphs II and III, as its board of directors determines would be helpful to advance the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The insurance plans developed by the association shall comply with all applicable insurance laws and rules, except as provided herein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The pool shall be payer of last resort of benefits whenever any other benefit or source of third-party payment is available.
