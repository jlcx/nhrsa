<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(11) A policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, prescription drug or other health care benefits pursuant to Part C or Part D of subchapter XVIII, chapter 7 of Title 42 of the United States Code, commonly known as Medicare Part C and D, or any regulations issued pursuant thereto.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Assure payment of benefits for premiums identical to the premiums and benefits (except for terms of conversion and renewability) that would have been payable under the policies of the insolvent insurer, for claims incurred:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) With respect to group policies, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date under such policies or contracts or 45 days, but in no event less than 30 days, after the date on which the association becomes obligated with respect to the policies.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) In providing the substitute coverage required under subparagraph (c), the association may offer either to reissue the terminated coverage or to issue an alternative policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(3) The association may reinsure any alternative or reissued policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Alternative policies shall contain at least the minimum statutory provisions required in this state and provide benefits that shall not be unreasonable in relation to the premium charged.  The association shall set the premium in accordance with a table of rates which it shall adopt.  The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but shall not reflect any changes in the health of the insured after the original policy was last underwritten.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any alternative policy issued by the association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy, the premium shall be set by the association in accordance with the amount of insurance provided and the age and class of risk, subject to approval of the commissioner or by a court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The association's obligations with respect to coverage under any policy of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under any reissued or alternative policy shall cease on the date such coverage or policy is replaced by another similar policy by the policyholder, the insured, or the association.

V. When proceeding under paragraphs II(a)(2) or III with respect to any policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the association shall assure the payment or crediting of a rate of interest consistent with RSA 408-B:5, II(b)(3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Nonpayment of premiums within 31 days after the date required under the terms of any guaranteed, assumed, alternative or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall terminate the association's obligations under the policy or coverage under this chapter with respect to the policy or coverage, except with respect to any claims incurred or any net cash surrender value which may be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable at the direction of the association, and the association shall be liable for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The protection provided by this chapter shall not apply where any guaranty protection is provided to residents of this state by the laws of the domiciliary state or jurisdiction of the impaired or insolvent insurer other than this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In carrying out its duties under paragraphs II and III, the association may, subject to approval by the court:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Impose permanent policy or contract liens in connection with any guarantee, assumption, or reinsurance agreement, if the association finds that the amounts which can be assessed under this chapter are less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the association's duties under this chapter, or that the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of such permanent policy or contract liens, to be in the public interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Impose temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans, or any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan value.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The association may render assistance and advice to the commissioner, upon the commissioner's request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage, or the performance of other contractual obligations of any impaired or insolvent insurer.
<br>

Such standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association, including, but not limited to, proposals for reinsuring, modifying, or guaranteeing the policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the policies or contracts and contractual obligations.  The association shall also have the right to appear or intervene before a court in another state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the association is or may become obligated or with jurisdiction over a third party against whom the association may have rights through subrogation of the insurer's policyholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. (a) Any person receiving benefits under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action relating to, the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter, whether the benefits are payments of or on account of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage, or provision of substitute or alternative coverages.  The association may require an assignment to it of such rights and cause of action by any payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant, as a condition precedent to the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this chapter upon such person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The subrogation rights of the association under this paragraph shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. The association may:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes, to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contracts provides for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A fixed interest rate;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Payment of dividends with minimum guarantees;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A different method for calculating interest or changes in value;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract, and;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-B:9 Assessments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such time and for such amounts as the board finds necessary.  Assessments shall be due not less than 30 days after prior written notice to the member insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There shall be 2 assessments, as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Class A assessments shall be made for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses and examinations conducted under the authority of RSA 408-B:12, V. Class A assessments may be made whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class B assessments shall be made to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under RSA 408-B:8 with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The amount of any Class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be made on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis.  If pro rata, the board may provide that it be credited against future Class B assessments.  A non-pro rata assessment shall not exceed $150 per member insurer in any one calendar year.  The amount of any Class B assessment shall be allocated for assessment purposes among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer or policies or contracts covered by each account for the 3 most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became impaired or insolvent, as the case may be, bears to such premiums received on business in this state for such calendar years by all assessed member insurers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be made until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.  Classification of assessments under paragraph II and computation of assessments under this paragraph shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.  In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the health account shall not in any one calendar year exceed 2 percent of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the 3 calendar years preceding the year in which the insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.  If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a one percent assessment for any subaccount of the life and annuity account in any one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, then pursuant to subparagraph III(b), the board shall access all subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in subparagraph V(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments.  A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policyowner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than Class A assessment, a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, for the amount of the assessment so paid.  All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue.  A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the commissioner may approve.

IV. It shall be the duty of the board of directors, upon majority vote, to notify the commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be an impaired or insolvent insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, request that the commissioner order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be an impaired or insolvent insurer.  Within 30 days of the receipt of such request, the commissioner shall begin an examination.  The examination may be conducted as a National Association of Insurance Commissioners examination or may be conducted by such persons as the commissioner designates.  The cost of the examination shall be paid by the association and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports.  In no event shall the examination report be released to the board of directors prior to its release to the public, but this shall not preclude the commissioner from complying with paragraph I.  The commissioner shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed.  The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the commissioner, but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the commissioner for the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The board of directors shall, at the conclusion of any insurer insolvency in which the association was obligated to pay covered claims, prepare a report to the commissioner containing such information as it may have in its possession bearing on the history and causes of the insolvency.  The board shall cooperate with the boards of directors of guaranty associations in other states in preparing a report on the history and causes of insolvency of a particular insurer, and may adopt by reference any report prepared by such other associations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-B:13 Credits for Assessments Paid. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A member insurer may offset against its tax liability under RSA 400-A any assessment described in RSA 408-B:9, II(b) for the life insurance and annuity account, and for the health account for guaranteeing the performance of contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer in regard to disability income coverages only, to the extent of 20 percent of the amount of the assessment for each of the 5 calendar years following the year in which the assessment was paid.  If a member insurer ceases doing business, all uncredited assessments described above may be credited against its tax liability under RSA 400-A for the year it ceases doing business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any sums acquired by refund from the association by member insurers, as stated in RSA 408-B:9, VI, and which were previously offset against taxes as described in paragraph I, shall be paid by these insurers to the state of New Hampshire in the manner required by the commissioner.  The association shall notify the commissioner that refunds have been made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-B:14 Miscellaneous Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Records shall be kept of all negotiations and meetings in which the association or its representatives are involved to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under RSA 408-B:8.  Records of the negotiations or meetings shall be made public only upon the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the duty of the association or render a report of its activities under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to RSA 408-B:8, XIII.  Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter.  Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subsection, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, and policyowners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer.  In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders of the continuing or successor insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under RSA 408-B:8 with respect to the insurer have been fully recovered by the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the 5 years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subparagraphs (b)-(d).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No such distribution shall be recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions received.  Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if they had been paid immediately.  If 2 or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The maximum amount recoverable under this paragraph shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If any person liable under subparagraph (c) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 408-B:19 Prohibited Advertisement of Insurance Guaranty Association Act in Insurance Sales;  Notice to Policyholders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person, including an insurer, agent or affiliate of an insurer shall make, publish, disseminate, circulate, or place before the public, or cause directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in any newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio station or television station, or in any other way, any advertisement, announcement or statement, written or oral, which uses the existence of the insurance guaranty association of this state for the purpose of sales, solicitation or inducement to purchase any form of insurance covered by the New Hampshire life and health insurance guaranty association act.  Provided, however, that this paragraph shall not apply to the New Hampshire life and health insurance guaranty association or any other entity which does not sell or solicit insurance.  The use of the protection afforded by this chapter, other than as provided by this paragraph, by any person in the sale, marketing, or advertising of insurance constitutes unfair competition and unfair practices under the New Hampshire unfair trade practices act, and is subject to sanctions imposed in that chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 180 days after January 1, 1996, the association shall prepare a summary document describing the general purposes and current limitations of the chapter and complying with paragraph III.  This document shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval.  Unless paragraph IV applies, at the expiration of the 60th day after the date on which the commissioner approves the document, an insurer may not deliver a policy or contract covered by a guaranty fund to a policy or contract holder unless the summary document is delivered to the policy or contract holder prior to or at the time of delivery of the policy or contract.  The document shall also be available upon request by a policyholder.  The distribution, delivery or contents or interpretation of this document does not guarantee that either the policy or the contract or the holder of the policy or contract is covered in the event of the impairment or insolvency of a member insurer.  The description document shall be revised by the association as amendments to the chapter may require.  Failure to receive this document does not give the policyholder, contract holder, certificate holder, or insured any greater rights than those stated in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The document prepared under paragraph II shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclaimer on its face.  The commissioner shall approve the disclaimer.  The disclaimer shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) State the name, address and telephone number of the life and health insurance guaranty association and insurance department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prominently warn the policy or contract holder that the life and health insurance guaranty association may not cover the policy or, if coverage is available, it will be subject to substantial limitations and exclusions and conditioned on continued residence in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) State the types of policies for which guaranty funds will provide coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) State that the insurer and its agents are prohibited by law from using the existence of the life and health insurance guaranty association for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) State that the policy or contract holder should not rely on coverage under the life and health insurance guaranty association when selecting an insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Explain rights available and procedures for filing a complaint to allege a violation of any provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Provide other information as directed by the commissioner, including but not limited to, sources for information about the financial condition of insurers provided that the information is not proprietary and is subject to disclosure under that state's public records law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No insurer or agent may deliver a policy or contract not covered by the association unless the insurer or agent, prior to or at the time of delivery, gives the policy or contract holder a separate written notice which clearly and conspicuously discloses that the policy or contract is not covered by the life and health insurance guaranty association.  The commissioner shall approve the notice.
