The association may require an assignment to it of such rights and cause of action by any payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant, as a condition precedent to the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this chapter upon such person.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) The subrogation rights of the association under this paragraph shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) In addition to subparagraphs (a) and (b), the association shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy which would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or holder of a policy or contract with respect to such policy or contracts.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIV.

The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes, to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXVI. In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, or reinsuring policies or contracts under paragraph I or II, the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contracts provides for:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) A fixed interest rate;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) Payment of dividends with minimum guarantees;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3) A different method for calculating interest or changes in value;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract, and;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.">
