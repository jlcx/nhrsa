However, in the case where one or more unallocated annuity contracts are covered contracts under this chapter and are owned by a trust or other entity for the benefit of 2 or more plan sponsors, coverage shall be afforded by the association if the largest interest in the trust or entity owning the contract or contracts is held by a plan sponsor whose principal place of business is in this state and in no event shall the association be obligated to cover more than $5,000,000 in benefits with respect to all these unallocated contracts.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(6) The limitations set forth in this paragraph are limitations on the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into account either its subrogation and assignments rights or the extent to which those benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies.  The costs of the association's obligations under this chapter may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(7) In performing its obligations to provide coverage under RSA 408-B:8, the association shall not be required to guarantee, assume, reinsure, or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured, or performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) With respect to one owner of multiple, non-group policies of life insurance, whether the policy owner is an individual, firm, corporation or other person, and whether the persons insured are officers, managers, employees, or other persons, more than $5,000,000 in benefits, regardless of the number of policies and contracts held by the owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) With respect to either one contract owner provided coverage under subparagraph I(c)(2);  or one plan sponsor whose plans own directly or in trust one or more unallocated annuity contracts not included in subparagraph (b)(2) of this paragraph, $5,000,000 in benefits, irrespective of the number of contracts with respect to the contract owner or plan sponsor.  However, in the case where one or more unallocated annuity contracts are covered contracts under this chapter and are owned by a trust or other entity for the benefit of 2 or more plan sponsors, coverage shall be afforded by the association if the largest interest in the trust or entity owning the contract or contracts is held by a plan sponsor whose principal place of business is in this state and in no event shall the association be obligated to cover more than $5,000,000 in benefits with respect to all these unallocated contracts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The limitations set forth in this paragraph are limitations on the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into account either its subrogation and assignments rights or the extent to which those benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies.  The costs of the association's obligations under this chapter may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) In performing its obligations to provide coverage under RSA 408-B:8, the association shall not be required to guarantee, assume, reinsure, or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured, or performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.
