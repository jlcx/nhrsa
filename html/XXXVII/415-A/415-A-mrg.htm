This period may be extended one time by the licensee for up to 15 days;  provided, that the licensee both determines that such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the licensee and notifies the claimant or claimant's representative, prior to the expiration of the initial 15-day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the licensee expects to render a decision.  If such an extension is necessary due to a failure of the claimant or claimant's representative to provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, benefits are covered as payable, the notice of extension shall specifically describe the required additional information needed, and the claimant or claimant's representative shall be given at least 45 days from receipt of the notice within which to provide the specified information.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In any request for a benefit determination, the claimant may authorize a representative to pursue the claim or benefit determination by submitting a written statement to the licensed entity that acknowledges the representation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No fees or costs shall be assessed against a claimant related to a request for claim benefit determination.

Every carrier or other licensed entity which offers group health insurance or employee benefit plans shall file with the insurance department, by April 1 of each year, and shall maintain a written procedure by which a claimant, or a representative of the claimant, shall have a reasonable opportunity to appeal a claim denial to the carrier or other licensed entity, and under which there shall be a full and fair review of the claim denial.  The written procedure filed with the insurance department shall include all forms used to process an appeal.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The claimant or claimant's representative shall be provided upon request, and without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to or considered in making the initial adverse claim determination;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The review shall be a de novo proceeding and shall consider all information, documents, or other material submitted in connection with the appeal without regard to whether the information was considered in making the claim denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the appeal of a claim denial that is based in whole or in part on a medical judgment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The review shall be conducted by or in consultation with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine;
<br>

(b) The titles and qualifying credentials of the person conducting the review shall be included in the decision;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the appeal of a claim for urgent care, a claim involving a matter that would seriously jeopardize the life or health of a covered person or would jeopardize the covered person's ability to regain maximum function, or a claim concerning an admission, availability of care, or the continued stay or health care service for a person who has received emergency services, but who has not been discharged from a facility, an expedited appeal process shall be made available which shall provide for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The submission of information by the claimant to the carrier by telephone, facsimile, or other expeditious method;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The determination of the appeal shall be made not more than 72 hours after the submission of the completed request for appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Timing and Notification for Determination on Appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of nonexpedited appeal of a pre-service claim or a post-service claim, the determination on appeal shall be made within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances, but in no event more than 30 days after receipt by the carrier or other licensed entity of the claimant's appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of an expedited appeal related to an urgent care claim, a carrier or other licensed entity shall make a decision and notify the covered person as expeditiously as the covered person's medical condition requires, but in no event more than 72 hours after the appeal is filed.  If the expedited review involves ongoing urgent care services, the service shall be continued without liability to the covered person until the covered person has been notified of the determination.  A carrier or other licensed entity shall provide written confirmation of its decision concerning an expedited review within 2 business days of providing notification of that decision, if the initial notification was not in writing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The period of time within which a decision shall be rendered on appeal shall begin to run at the time the appeal is filed in accordance with the appeal procedures of the carrier or other licensed entity, without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a determination on appeal is contained in the filing.  In the event the claimant fails to submit information necessary to decide the appeal, the period for making the determination on appeal shall be tolled from the date the claimant is notified in writing of what additional information is required until the date the claimant responds to the request.  The carrier or other licensed entity shall provide notification of incompleteness as soon as possible;  but in no event more than 24 hours after the filing of the appeal in appeals involving urgent care.  In the event that the claimant fails, within a 45-day period from the date of notification, to provide sufficient information, the carrier may deny the appeal on the basis of incompleteness.  The appeal may be reopened upon receipt of the required information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-A:5 Preexisting Conditions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an insurer or a nonprofit hospital or medical service association elects to use a simplified application form for a policy other than a Medicare supplement policy, with or without a question as to the applicant's health at the time of application, but without any questions concerning the insured's health history or medical treatment history, the policy, 9 months after the date of enrollment, must cover any loss occurring from any preexisting condition not specifically excluded from coverage by terms of the policy and, except as so provided, the policy shall not include wording that would permit a defense based upon preexisting conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For policies that meet the definition of health coverage under RSA 420-G:2, IX, an insurer may impose a preexisting condition exclusion period, but only if it is at least as favorable to covered persons as the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No preexisting condition exclusion period shall extend beyond a period of 9 consecutive months after the date of enrollment of the person's health coverage;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such preexisting condition exclusion period shall only apply to a condition, whether physical or mental, regardless of the cause of the condition, for which medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment was recommended or received during the 3 months immediately preceding the enrollment date of health coverage.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I, an insurer may use transportation outside the enhanced 911 or other government emergency medical services system for services that are not in response to an emergency medical condition, as defined in RSA 420-J:3, XV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No accident or health insurance policy issued or renewed after July 7, 2000 shall contain any provision requiring an insured or enrollee to obtain prior authorization before accessing the enhanced 911 system or other state, county, or local government emergency medical services system for response and/or transportation for emergency services, as defined in RSA 420-J:3, XVI.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV.
