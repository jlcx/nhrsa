&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Rules promulgated pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to notice and hearing pursuant to RSA 541-A.  When a rule adopted pursuant to this chapter so provides, a policy of insurance issued subsequent to the rule's effective date and any optionally renewable policy of insurance renewed subsequent to the rule's effective date which does not comply with the rule shall, not less than 60 days after the rule's effective date, be construed, and the insurer or corporation shall be liable, as if the policy did comply with the rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall adopt rules to establish specific standards for processing benefit claims under group disability plans that shall be consistent with and not more restrictive than the United States Department of Labor Benefit Claims Procedure Regulation, 29 CFR 2560.503, as existing and thereafter amended, that sets standards for group disability plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
