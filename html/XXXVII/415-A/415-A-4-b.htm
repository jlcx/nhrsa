&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-A:4-b Appeal Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every carrier or other licensed entity which offers group health insurance or employee benefit plans shall file with the insurance department, by April 1 of each year, and shall maintain a written procedure by which a claimant, or a representative of the claimant, shall have a reasonable opportunity to appeal a claim denial to the carrier or other licensed entity, and under which there shall be a full and fair review of the claim denial.  The written procedure filed with the insurance department shall include all forms used to process an appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Full and fair review shall require that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person or persons reviewing the grievance shall not be the same person or persons making the initial determination, shall not be subordinate to or the supervisor of the person making the initial determination, and shall act as a fiduciary;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person reviewing the grievance on a first or second level appeal shall have appropriate medical and professional expertise and credentials to competently render a determination on appeal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The claimant or claimant's representative shall have at least 180 days following receipt of a notification of an adverse claim determination to appeal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The claimant or claimant's representative shall have an opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim without regard to whether those documents or materials were considered in making the initial determination;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The claimant or claimant's representative shall be provided upon request, and without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to or considered in making the initial adverse claim determination;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The review shall be a de novo proceeding and shall consider all information, documents, or other material submitted in connection with the appeal without regard to whether the information was considered in making the claim denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the appeal of a claim denial that is based in whole or in part on a medical judgment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The review shall be conducted by or in consultation with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The titles and qualifying credentials of the person conducting the review shall be included in the decision;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The identity and qualifications of any medical or vocational expert whose advice was considered, without regard to whether it was relied upon in making the initial claim denial, shall be made available to the claimant upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the appeal of a claim for urgent care, a claim involving a matter that would seriously jeopardize the life or health of a covered person or would jeopardize the covered person's ability to regain maximum function, or a claim concerning an admission, availability of care, or the continued stay or health care service for a person who has received emergency services, but who has not been discharged from a facility, an expedited appeal process shall be made available which shall provide for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The submission of information by the claimant to the carrier by telephone, facsimile, or other expeditious method;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The determination of the appeal shall be made not more than 72 hours after the submission of the completed request for appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Timing and Notification for Determination on Appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of nonexpedited appeal of a pre-service claim or a post-service claim, the determination on appeal shall be made within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances, but in no event more than 30 days after receipt by the carrier or other licensed entity of the claimant's appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of an expedited appeal related to an urgent care claim, a carrier or other licensed entity shall make a decision and notify the covered person as expeditiously as the covered person's medical condition requires, but in no event more than 72 hours after the appeal is filed.  If the expedited review involves ongoing urgent care services, the service shall be continued without liability to the covered person until the covered person has been notified of the determination.  A carrier or other licensed entity shall provide written confirmation of its decision concerning an expedited review within 2 business days of providing notification of that decision, if the initial notification was not in writing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The period of time within which a decision shall be rendered on appeal shall begin to run at the time the appeal is filed in accordance with the appeal procedures of the carrier or other licensed entity, without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a determination on appeal is contained in the filing.  In the event the claimant fails to submit information necessary to decide the appeal, the period for making the determination on appeal shall be tolled from the date the claimant is notified in writing of what additional information is required until the date the claimant responds to the request.  The carrier or other licensed entity shall provide notification of incompleteness as soon as possible;  but in no event more than 24 hours after the filing of the appeal in appeals involving urgent care.  In the event that the claimant fails, within a 45-day period from the date of notification, to provide sufficient information, the carrier may deny the appeal on the basis of incompleteness.  The appeal may be reopened upon receipt of the required information.
