No insurer shall cancel or refuse to write or renew a policy of insurance insuring against any of the contingencies set forth in RSA 417-B:1 solely because of the age, residence, race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, marital status, or lawful occupation, including the military service, of anyone who is or seeks to become insured or solely because another insurer has refused to write a policy, or has cancelled or has refused to renew an existing policy in which that person was the named insured.
