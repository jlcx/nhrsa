Such notice shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The effective date shall not be less than 45 days after the date the notice is mailed or delivered to the named insured provided however, the effective date may be 10 days from the date of mailing or delivery when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The policy is being cancelled or not renewed for nonpayment of premium;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The policy is not a renewal policy and the cancellation notice is mailed or delivered within 90 days of the policy's effective date.
