&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 417-B:3-a Nonrenewal for Filing a Claim. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The nonrenewal of a homeowner's insurance policy is prohibited if the nonrenewal is based solely on the insured having filed a single valid claim within any one previous or current policy term.  For policies that contain no fixed expiration date or that are issued for other than annual periods a term shall be considered each 12 month anniversary from the date of policy issuance.
