&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 405:47 Credit Allowed a Domestic Ceding Insurer. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of paragraphs I, II, III, IV, or V.  Credit shall be allowed under paragraphs I, II, or III only as respects cessions of those kinds or classes of business which the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance.  Credit shall be allowed under paragraphs III or IV only if the applicable requirements of paragraph VI have been satisfied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state.  To be eligible for accreditation a reinsurer shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) File with the commissioner evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Submit to this state's authority to examine its books and records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or, in the case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) File annually with the commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers.  An assuming insurer is deemed to meet the requirements as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000 and its accreditation has not been denied by the commissioner within 90 days after submission of its application. 
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled in, or, in the case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through, a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this subdivision and the assuming insurer or U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subparagraph (a)(1) does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in RSA 405:46 for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.  To enable the commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the NAIC Annual Statement form by licensed insurers.  The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the commissioner and bear the expense of examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this section unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled.  The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction of the United States.  The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer's U.S. ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.  The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.  No later than February 28 of each year, the trustee of the trust shall report to the commissioner in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurers:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The trust fund for a single assuming insurer shall consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers, and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20,000,000, except as provided in subparagraph (2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least 3 full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of U.S. ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development.  The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency.  The minimum required trusteed surplus shall not be reduced to an amount less than 30 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers covered by the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment, or renewal date on or after August 1, 1995, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' several liabilities attributable to business ceded by U.S. domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter of the group;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) In addition to these trusts, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of the U.S. domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member;  or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least 3 years immediately prior to making application for accreditation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Maintain aggregate policyholders' surplus of at least $10,000,000,000;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Maintain a trust fund in an amount not less than the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by U.S. domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In addition, maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of U.S. domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for these liabilities;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, make available to the commissioner an annual certification of each underwriter member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by its independent public accountant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (c);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the commissioner pursuant to rule;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Maintain financial strength ratings from 2 or more rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner pursuant to rule;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final U.S. judgment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer.  To be eligible for certification, in addition to satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (a):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents (net of liabilities) of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the commissioner to provide adequate protection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member;  or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner as a certified reinsurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) To determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-U.S. assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-U.S. jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the U.S.  A qualified jurisdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurance domiciled within that jurisdiction.  A jurisdiction shall not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final U.S. judgments and arbitration awards.  Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the NAIC committee process.  The commissioner shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions.  If the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the commissioner shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) U.S. jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commissioner shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner pursuant to rule.  The commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from U.S. ceding insurers under this subparagraph at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in rules accepted by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of RSA 405:50, or in a multi-beneficiary trust in accordance with RSA 405:47, IV, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to RSA 405:47, IV, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multi-beneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this subparagraph or comparable laws of other U.S. jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to RSA 405:47, IV.  It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under RSA 405:47, IV-a that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in RSA 405:47, IV are not applicable with respect to a multi-beneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this paragraph, except that such trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10,000,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subparagraph, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and has the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) For purposes of this subparagraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) In this subparagraph, "terminated'' means revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender and inactive status.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this section, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification, and has the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business.  An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this paragraph, and the commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of paragraphs I, II, III IV, or IV-a but only with respect to the insurance of risks located in the jurisdictions where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited, or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit permitted by paragraphs III and IV shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Shall comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Shall abide by the final decision of such court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To designate the commissioner or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) This paragraph is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if this obligation is created in the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) No credit under this section shall be allowed, as an admitted asset or deduction from liability, to any ceding insurer for reinsurance, unless the reinsurance contract provides, in substance, that in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer, the reinsurance shall be payable by the assuming insurer on the basis of the claims allowed against the ceding insurer in the insolvency proceedings, under contract or contracts reinsured, without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator or receiver except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Where the contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where the assuming insurer with the consent of the direct insured or insured has assumed such policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A reinsurance contract may provide that the domiciliary liquidator or receiver of any insolvent ceding insurer shall, within a specified or reasonable time after the claim is filed in court or in the receivership, give written notice to the assuming insurer of all or part of any claims against the ceding insurer on the policy or bond reinsured.  During the pendency of the claim, any assuming insurer may investigate the claim and, unless forbidden to do so by the reinsurance agreement, may intervene in the proceeding in which the claim is pending and interpose any defenses it considers available which have not been raised by the ceding insurer, its liquidator, or receiver.  The expenses incurred by the assuming insurer in this type of action are payable up to the amount of the expenses or the amount of the benefit produced, whichever is less, as expenses of the receivership.  If 2 or more assuming insurers have potential liability because of the same claim, the expenses shall be apportioned among them in proportion to the benefit received.
