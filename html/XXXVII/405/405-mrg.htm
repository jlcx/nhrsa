&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No foreign insurer which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled in whole or in substantial part by any government or governmental agency shall be authorized to transact insurance in this state.  Membership in a mutual insurer or subscribership in a reciprocal insurer or ownership of stock in an insurer by the alien property custodian or similar official of the United States or ownership of stock or other security which does not have voting rights with respect to the management of the insurer or supervision of an insurer by public authority shall not be deemed to be an ownership or control of the insurer for the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall not grant or continue authority to transact insurance in this state as to any insurer or proposed insurer that management of which is found by the commissioner after investigation or upon reliable information to be incompetent or dishonest or untrustworthy or of unfavorable business repute or so lacking in insurance company managerial experience in operations of the kind proposed in this state as to make such operation, currently or prospectively, hazardous to or contrary to the best interests of, the insurance-buying or investing public of this state, or which the commissioner has good reason to believe is affiliated directly or indirectly through ownership, control, reinsurance transactions, or other business relations with any person or persons of unfavorable business repute or whose business operations are or have been marked, to the injury of insurers, stockholders, policyholders, creditors, or the public, by illegality, or by manipulation of assets or of accounts or of reinsurance or by bad faith.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the foregoing provisions are complied with and the commissioner is satisfied that the company has the requisite capital and assets and is a safe, reliable company, entitled to confidence, he shall grant a license to it to do insurance business by authorized agents within the state, subject to the laws of the state, until June 14 thereafter.  Annually thereafter, on June 14, such license may be renewed so long as the company shall comply with the requirements of the law and the commissioner shall regard it as safe, reliable and entitled to confidence, and so long as the company continues to conduct a meaningful insurance business, as determined by the commissioner, within New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every insurance company shall conduct its business in the legal name of the insurer as it appears on the insurer's application filed with the NAIC for a company code number.  If an insurer is part of a group of affiliated insurers, the group name may appear in addition to the name of the individual insuring company, but the group name shall not be used in lieu of the legal name of the individual company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All insurance policies and contracts, and any endorsements or amendments separately issued and intended to be attached to such policies or contracts, shall identify the legal name, as set forth in paragraph II, of the insurer that is directly assuming the obligations under the policy or contract.  Inclusion of the legal name of the insurer in a policy jacket, declaration, or other similar cover page issued with the policy, contract, or endorsement shall be deemed to be in compliance with this requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Identification of the insuring company on any advertisement or promotional materials shall be governed by the laws or rules related to the advertisements, misrepresentations in sale of insurance, and misrepresentation in insurance transactions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 405:24 Applicability;  Issue. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Foreign unlicensed companies that satisfy the provisions of RSA 405:26 and are approved by the commissioner as unadmitted surplus lines companies are not subject to any statutory or regulatory provision unless the statute or regulation specifically references unadmitted surplus lines companies;  provided however, unadmitted surplus lines companies shall be subject to RSA 417:1 through RSA 417:22.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Surplus lines insurance may be placed by a surplus lines licensee if the insurer is authorized to write the type of insurance in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and either meets the criteria established through a multi-state agreement pursuant to RSA 405-B:3 or meets one of the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The insurer has capital and surplus or its equivalent under the laws of its domiciliary jurisdiction which equals the greater of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The minimum capital and surplus requirements under RSA 401:4 or RSA 402:13;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Fifteen million dollars;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The insurer is a nonadmitted insurer domiciled outside the United States that is listed on the Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers maintained by the International Insurers Department of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner, pursuant to RSA 402-J, may issue a producer license to a resident of the state permitting the producer named therein to procure insurance policies and contracts of insurance or suretyship to be effective in this state in foreign insurance companies not authorized to transact business in this state, but which are duly authorized to do business in some state having an insurance commissioner, or in a domestic insurer authorized to do business in accordance with paragraph IV.  Such insurance or suretyship placed with an unadmitted surplus lines company shall be for such amount as the producer cannot place with an admitted company, and shall not be placed until the producer has first satisfied the insurance commissioner that the producer cannot procure such an insurance in an admitted company.  For purposes of this paragraph, an insurer authorized to do business in accordance with paragraph IV shall not be deemed to be authorized or admitted.  Before delivering to the insured a policy or binder of insurance written under the provisions of this section, every producer shall have stamped in a form approved by the commissioner on the face of the binder or policy the following:  "The company issuing this policy is an eligible surplus lines insurer in the state of New Hampshire and the rates charged and policy forms used have not been approved by the commissioner of insurance.  If the company issuing this policy becomes insolvent, the New Hampshire insurance guaranty fund shall not be liable for any claims made against the policy.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A domestic insurer possessing policyholder surplus of at least $15,000,000 may, pursuant to a resolution by its board of directors, and with the approval of the commissioner, be designated as a domestic surplus lines insurer.  The authority of a domestic surplus lines insurer in this state shall be limited to providing insurance covering risks procured from a surplus lines producer in accordance with this section.  A domestic surplus lines insurer is not subject to the provisions of Title XXXVII, except that it shall be subject to any statute or regulation which specifically references unadmitted surplus lines companies and to the provisions of RSA 400-A:37, RSA 400-A:39, RSA 404-F, and RSA 417:1 through 417:31.

The general court declares that the matters contained in this subdivision are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. sections 1011-1012.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 405:47 Credit Allowed a Domestic Ceding Insurer. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of paragraphs I, II, III, IV, or V. Credit shall be allowed under paragraphs I, II, or III only relating to cessions of those kinds or classes of business which the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a U. S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance.  Credit shall be allowed under paragraphs III or IV only if the applicable requirements of paragraph VI have been satisfied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is licensed to transact that line of insurance or reinsurance in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state.  An accredited reinsurer is one that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Files with the commissioner evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(B) Maintains a surplus concerning policyholders in an amount less than $20,000,000 and whose accreditation has been approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Credit shall not be allowed a domestic ceding insurer if the assuming insurer's accreditation has been revoked by the commissioner after notice and hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled in, or in case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer that is entered through, a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this subdivision and the assuming insurer or U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Maintains a surplus concerning policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The requirement of subparagraph III(a)(1) shall not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in RSA 405:46, VII, for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.  To enable the commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the NAIC Annual Statement form by licensed insurers.  The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the commissioner and bear the expense of examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) (1) Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this section unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled.  The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction of the United States.  The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer's U.S. ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.  The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.  No later than February 28 of each year, the trustee of the trust shall report to the commissioner in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurers:
<br>

If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of RSA 405:47, I-III, the credit permitted by RSA 405:47 shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount less than the amount required by RSA 405:47, IV(c), or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The assets shall be distributed by and claims shall be filed with and valued by the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part thereof are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the U.S. ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part thereof shall be returned by the commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in accordance with the trust agreement.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 405:49 Reinsurance Insolvency. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No credit shall be allowed, as an admitted asset or deduction from liability, to any ceding insurer for reinsurance, unless the reinsurance contract provides, in substance, that in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer, the reinsurance shall be payable by the assuming insurer on the basis of the claims allowed against the ceding insurer in the insolvency proceedings, under contract or contracts reinsured without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator or receiver except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Where the contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Where the assuming insurer with the consent of the direct insured or insured has assumed such policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A reinsurance contract may provide that the domiciliary liquidator or receiver of any insolvent ceding insurer shall, within a specified or reasonable time after the claim is filed in court or in the receivership, give written notice to the assuming insurer of all or part of any claim against the ceding insurer on the policy or bond reinsured.  During the pendency of the claim, any assuming insurer may investigate the claim and, unless forbidden to do so by the reinsurance agreement, may intervene in the proceeding in which the claim is pending and interpose any defenses it considers available which have not been raised by the ceding insurer, its liquidator or receiver.  The expenses incurred by the assuming insurer in this type of action are payable up to the amount of the expenses or the amount of the benefit produced, whichever is less, as expenses of the receivership.  If 2 or more assuming insurers have potential liability because of the same claim, the expenses shall be apportioned among them in proportion to the benefit received.
