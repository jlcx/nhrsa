I. If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner shall give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hearing.  The suspension or revocation shall not take effect until after the commissioner's order on hearing, unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The reinsurer waives its right to a hearing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commissioner's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under RSA 405:47, IV-a;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The commissioner finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualified for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with RSA 405:50.  If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with RSA 405:47, IV-a(e) and RSA 405:50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A ceding insurer shall take steps to manage its reinsurance recoverables proportionate to its own book of business.  A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner within 30 days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, exceeds 50 percent of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders, or after it is determined that the reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit.  The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A ceding insurer shall take steps to diversify its reinsurance program.  A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner within 30 days after ceding to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, more than 20 percent of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in the prior calendar year, or after it has determined that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit.  The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.
