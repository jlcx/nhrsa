<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every arrangement shall, annually within 4 months of the end of the fiscal year or within such extension of time as the commissioner for good cause may grant, file a report with the commissioner, verified by the oath of a member of the board of trustees or by an administrative executive appointed by the board, showing its condition on the last day of the preceding fiscal year.  The report shall contain a financial statement of the arrangement, including its balance sheet and a statement of operations for the preceding year certified by an independent certified public accountant.  The report shall also include an analysis of the adequacy of reserves and contributions or premiums charged, based on a review of past and projected claims and expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to information called for and furnished in connection with the annual report, if reasonable grounds exist, the commissioner may request information which summarizes paid and incurred expenses, and contributions or premiums received, and may request evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that the arrangement is actuarially sound.  Such information and evidence shall be furnished to the commissioner by the arrangement as soon as reasonably possible after requested by the commissioner, but no later than 30 days after such request, unless the commissioner, for good cause, grants an extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At least once every 3 years, each arrangement shall have a report prepared by an actuary who is a member of the Society of Actuaries of the American Academy of Actuaries as to the actuarial soundness of the arrangement.  The report shall be made available to the commissioner upon request.  The report shall consist of, but shall not be limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Adequacy of contribution rate in meeting the level of benefits provided and changes, if any, needed in the contribution rates to achieve or preserve a level of funding deemed adequate to enable payment of the benefit amounts provided under the arrangement, which shall include a valuation of present assets, based on statement value, and prospective assets and liabilities of the plan and the extent of any unfunded accrued liabilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A plan to amortize any unfunded liabilities and a description of actions taken to reduce unfunded liabilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A description and explanation of actuarial assumptions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A schedule illustrating the amortization of any unfunded liabilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A comparative review illustrating the level of funds available to the arrangement from rates, investment income, and other sources realized over the period covered by the report, indicating the assumptions used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A statement by the actuary that the report is complete and accurate and that in his opinion the techniques and assumptions used are reasonable and meet the requirements and intent of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Other factors or statements as may be reasonably required by the commissioner in order to determine the actuarial soundness of the plan.
