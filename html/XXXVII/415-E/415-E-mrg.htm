&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-E:2 Applicability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person shall, after April 1, 1992, operate a multiple-employer welfare arrangement unless such arrangement is approved by the commissioner.  No person shall, after April 1, 1992, operate a multiple-employer welfare arrangement in existence prior to April 1, 1992, unless such arrangement has submitted for approval in compliance with RSA 415-E:4, or otherwise meets the special requirements of paragraph III of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This chapter shall not apply to a multiple-employer welfare arrangement which offers or provides benefits which are fully insured by an authorized insurer or under the provisions of RSA 5-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. RSA 415-E:4, RSA 415-E:8, RSA 415-E:9, III and RSA 415-E:11 shall not apply to a multiple-employer welfare arrangement which:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Meets the general eligibility requirements of RSA 415-E:3, I;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Is administered primarily from a principal place of business located within the state of New Hampshire;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Has provided employee health benefits for a continuous period of 10 or more years;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Maintains a termination liability fund wherein the fund balance plus the total liabilities of the multiple-employer welfare arrangement shall at no time, for a consecutive 90-day period, be less than 40 percent of the aggregate amount of premiums billed during the 6 prior months.  For purposes of this subparagraph, that surety amount, if any, deposited with the commissioner pursuant to RSA 415-E:7, I, may be credited as a fund balance asset toward the termination liability fund amount required under this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Files with the commissioner, not later than 4 months following the end of each fiscal year, a report on the financial status of the termination liability fund, which report is filed under oath by a member of its board of trustees, or by an administrative executive duly appointed by the board, and further certified to by an independent certified public accountant with a place of business located within the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the event a multiple-employer welfare arrangement does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph III, the arrangement shall within 60 days file with the commissioner an application for approval under RSA 415-E:4, and shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter until such time as the requirements of paragraph III are satisfied.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Each arrangement shall provide to each covered employee, on request, a written statement of the dollar amount of allowable benefit for any procedure which is requested by the appropriate procedure code.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may, upon reasonable notice, conduct an examination of the loss reserves, financial condition, specific excess insurance, and working capital of a multiple-employer welfare arrangement.  If the commissioner preliminarily finds that the reserves, specific excess insurance, or financial condition may be inadequate, or that the arrangement does not have a combined working capital in an amount establishing the financial strength and liquidity of the arrangement to pay claims promptly and showing evidence of the financial ability of the arrangement to meet its obligations to covered employees, the commissioner shall notify the arrangement of such inadequacy.  Upon being so notified, the arrangement shall within 30 days file with the commissioner all information which, in the belief of the arrangement, proves the reasonableness and adequacy of the condition noted as being inadequate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the commissioner determines, after reviewing the information filed, that an inadequate condition exists, the arrangement shall implement, within 30 days, a plan to correct the inadequacy and shall file proof of reasonable improvement or adequate condition with the commissioner within 6 months of the implementation of the plan.  If the commissioner is satisfied that the plan submitted to improve the inadequate condition of the arrangement is sufficient, he shall so notify the arrangement.  The arrangement shall report quarterly to the commissioner until the causes of the inadequate condition have been corrected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may suspend or revoke the approval of an arrangement if he finds that the arrangement has failed to correct or reasonably improve an inadequate condition within the time authorized by paragraph II.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-E:7 Insolvency Protection. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To assure the faithful performance of its obligations to its member employers and covered employees and their dependents, every arrangement shall, within 30 days after the close of the arrangement's fiscal year, deposit with the commissioner cash, securities, or any combination of these or other measures acceptable to the commissioner, in an amount equal to 25 percent of the preceding 12 months' health care claims expenditures or 5 percent of gross annual premiums for the succeeding year, whichever is greater;  however, in no case shall the amount of the deposit exceed $100,000.  All income from deposits shall belong to the depositing arrangement and shall be paid to it as it becomes available.  An arrangement that has made a securities deposit may withdraw that deposit, or any part of such deposit, after making a substitute deposit of cash, securities, or any combination of these or other measures of equal amount and value, upon approval by the commissioner.  No judgment creditor or other claimant of a multiple-employer welfare association shall have the right to levy upon any of the assets or securities held in this state as a deposit under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In lieu of the deposit required under paragraph I, an arrangement may file with the commissioner a surety bond in like amount.  The bond shall be one issued by an authorized surety insurer, shall be for the same purpose as the deposit in lieu of which it is filed, and shall be subject to the commissioner's approval.  No bond shall be canceled or subject to cancellation unless at least 60 days' advance notice of cancellation in writing is filed with the commissioner.  No bond shall be approved unless it covers liabilities arising from all policies and contracts issued and entered into during the time the bond is in effect and unless the commissioner is satisfied that the bond provides the same degree of security as would be provided by a deposit of securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event of an insolvency termination, the deposit held by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 415-E:7, I, or the bond held by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 415-E:7, II, shall be applied to the extent of the insolvency.  Any deposit funds remaining in excess of the amount needed to make the arrangement solvent shall be distributed in accordance with RSA 415-E:10.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every arrangement shall, annually within 4 months of the end of the fiscal year or within such extension of time as the commissioner for good cause may grant, file a report with the commissioner, verified by the oath of a member of the board of trustees or by an administrative executive appointed by the board, showing its condition on the last day of the preceding fiscal year.  The report shall contain a financial statement of the arrangement, including its balance sheet and a statement of operations for the preceding year certified by an independent certified public accountant.  The report shall also include an analysis of the adequacy of reserves and contributions or premiums charged, based on a review of past and projected claims and expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to information called for and furnished in connection with the annual report, if reasonable grounds exist, the commissioner may request information which summarizes paid and incurred expenses, and contributions or premiums received, and may request evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that the arrangement is actuarially sound.  Such information and evidence shall be furnished to the commissioner by the arrangement as soon as reasonably possible after requested by the commissioner, but no later than 30 days after such request, unless the commissioner, for good cause, grants an extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At least once every 3 years, each arrangement shall have a report prepared by an actuary who is a member of the Society of Actuaries of the American Academy of Actuaries as to the actuarial soundness of the arrangement.

(e) A comparative review illustrating the level of funds available to the arrangement from rates, investment income, and other sources realized over the period covered by the report, indicating the assumptions used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A statement by the actuary that the report is complete and accurate and that in his opinion the techniques and assumptions used are reasonable and meet the requirements and intent of this chapter.
