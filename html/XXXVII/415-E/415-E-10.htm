&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 415-E:10 Termination of Arrangement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If an arrangement is terminated for any reason, it shall pay all outstanding claims, debts, and obligations.  The arrangement may retain sufficient funds to provide coverage for such additional period as the trustees of the arrangement consider prudent.  In addition, the trustees may purchase such additional insurance as they consider necessary for protection against potential future claims.  Any funds remaining in the arrangement after satisfaction of all obligations upon termination shall be paid to participating employers and/or covered employees as of the termination date in some equitable manner meeting with the approval of the commissioner, including, without ruling out other alternatives, equally on a per capita basis to each participating employer and/or employee who is covered under the arrangement as of the effective date of termination.
