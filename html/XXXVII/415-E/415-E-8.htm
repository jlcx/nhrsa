&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No policy or contract form, application form, certificate, rider, endorsement, summary plan description, or other evidence of coverage shall be issued by an arrangement unless the form and all changes to it have been filed with the commissioner by or on behalf of the arrangement which proposed to use such form and have been approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall disapprove any form filed under this section, or withdraw any previous approval, only if the form:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is in any respect in violation of, or does not comply with, this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Contains or incorporates by reference, where such incorporation is otherwise permissible, any inconsistent, ambiguous, or misleading clauses, or exceptions and conditions which deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Has any title, heading, or other indication of its provisions which is misleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Is printed or otherwise reproduced in such manner as to render any material provision of the form substantially illegible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
