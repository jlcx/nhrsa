&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may, upon reasonable notice, conduct an examination of the loss reserves, financial condition, specific excess insurance, and working capital of a multiple-employer welfare arrangement.  If the commissioner preliminarily finds that the reserves, specific excess insurance, or financial condition may be inadequate, or that the arrangement does not have a combined working capital in an amount establishing the financial strength and liquidity of the arrangement to pay claims promptly and showing evidence of the financial ability of the arrangement to meet its obligations to covered employees, the commissioner shall notify the arrangement of such inadequacy.  Upon being so notified, the arrangement shall within 30 days file with the commissioner all information which, in the belief of the arrangement, proves the reasonableness and adequacy of the condition noted as being inadequate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the commissioner determines, after reviewing the information filed, that an inadequate condition exists, the arrangement shall implement, within 30 days, a plan to correct the inadequacy and shall file proof of reasonable improvement or adequate condition with the commissioner within 6 months of the implementation of the plan.  If the commissioner is satisfied that the plan submitted to improve the inadequate condition of the arrangement is sufficient, he shall so notify the arrangement.  The arrangement shall report quarterly to the commissioner until the causes of the inadequate condition have been corrected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may suspend or revoke the approval of an arrangement if he finds that the arrangement has failed to correct or reasonably improve an inadequate condition within the time authorized by paragraph II.
