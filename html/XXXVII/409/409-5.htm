The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to:  (a) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (b) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, the foregoing items (a) and (b) being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs I and II of this section except that, for the purposes of (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph I, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 409:5-a, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than 3 years younger than the actual age of the insured, and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section.  Except as provided in paragraph III of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts stated in the policy as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (a) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;  (b) 2 percent of the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as hereinafter defined, if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy;  (c) 40 percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year;  (d) 25 percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.  Provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in subparagraphs (c) and (d), no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of the amount of insurance or level amount equivalent to such percentage.  The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent level amount of such insurance for the purpose of this section shall be deemed to be the level amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the inception of the insurance as the benefits under the policy;  provided, however, that, in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age 10, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age 10 were the amount provided by such policy at age 10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to:  (a) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (b) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, the foregoing items (a) and (b) being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs I and II of this section except that, for the purposes of (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph I, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 409:5-a, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than 3 years younger than the actual age of the insured, and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.  All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding 3- 1/2 percent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.  Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than 130 percent of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table.  Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.
