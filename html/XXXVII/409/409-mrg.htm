&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:2 Nonforfeiture Provisions Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of policies issued on and after the operative date as defined in RSA 409:8, no policy of life insurance, except as stated in RSA 409:7, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it shall contain in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this section and are essentially in compliance with RSA 409:6-a:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That, in the event of default in any premium payment, the company will grant, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as may be specified in this chapter.  In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the company may substitute, upon proper request, not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That, upon surrender of the policy within 60 days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least 3 full years in the case of ordinary insurance or 5 full years in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be specified in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That, if the policy shall have become paid-up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, upon surrender of the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be specified in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy.  In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first 20 policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the company on the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered;  an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the company on the policy;  if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated in the policy, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered;  and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any of the foregoing provisions or portions of those provisions not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of 6 months after demand for such payment with surrender of the policy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:3 Minimum Cash Surrender Values. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by RSA 409:2, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of:  (a) the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in RSA 409:5, RSA 409:5-a and RSA 409:5-b, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, and (b) the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section, which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph I of this section shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section, which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age 71, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph I of this section shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid-up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by RSA 409:2, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the company on the policy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:5 Adjusted Premiums. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section.  Except as provided in paragraph III of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts stated in the policy as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (a) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;  (b) 2 percent of the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as hereinafter defined, if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy;  (c) 40 percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year;  (d) 25 percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.  Provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in subparagraphs (c) and (d), no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of the amount of insurance or level amount equivalent to such percentage.  The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent level amount of such insurance for the purpose of this section shall be deemed to be the level amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the inception of the insurance as the benefits under the policy;  provided, however, that, in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age 10, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age 10 were the amount provided by such policy at age 10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to:  (a) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (b) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, the foregoing items (a) and (b) being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs I and II of this section except that, for the purposes of (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph I, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 409:5-a, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than 3 years younger than the actual age of the insured, and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.  All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding 3- 1/2 percent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.  Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than 130 percent of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table.  Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:5-a Adjusted Premiums After Certain Dates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This paragraph shall not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section.  In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph as defined in this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed 3- 1/2 percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding 4 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 1, 1973, and prior to August 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding 5- 1/2 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after August 1, 1979, and provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than 6 years younger than the actual age of the insured.  Provided, however, that, in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may not be more than those shown in the Commissioner's 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table.  Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.  After August 21, 1959, any company may file with the insurance commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1966.  After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for such company), this paragraph shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies issued after such specified date by such company.  If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for such company shall be January 1, 1966.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This paragraph shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section.  In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph as defined in this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed 3- 1/2 percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding 4 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 1, 1973, and prior to August 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding 5- 1/2 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after August 1, 1979.  Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not less than those shown in the Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.  Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.  After August 21, 1959, any company may file with the insurance commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1968.  After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for such company), this paragraph shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such company.  If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for such company shall be January 1, 1968.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:5-b Adjusted Premium After Later Dates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section shall apply to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this section as defined in this section.  Except as provided in paragraph VII of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:  (a) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;  (b) one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years;  and (c) 125 percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereafter defined.  Provided, however, that in applying the percentage specified in subparagraph (c), no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years.  The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy.  At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums, the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph VII of this section, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The sum of (1) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, and (2) the additional expense allowance, if any, over
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) One percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) 125 percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (a) by (b) where:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Equals the sum of
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one percent per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by policy, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Equals the present value of an annuity of one percent per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or, at the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors;  for all policies of industrial insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table;  and, for all policies issued in a particular calendar year, be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this section, for policies issued in that calendar year.  Provided, however, that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this section, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by RSA 409:2, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner's 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance, and not more than the Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables previously mentioned in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f)(1) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rule adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioner's 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Standard Ordinary Mortality Table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioner's 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table.  If the commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Mortality Table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g)(1) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioner's standard industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rule adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioner's Standard Mortality Table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.  If the commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioner's Standard Industrial Mortality Table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The nonforfeiture interest rate is defined below:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to 125 percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in RSA 410 rounded to the nearer  1/4 of one percent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:5-c Commissioner's Authority to Approve Certain Plans. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in RSA 409:2, 409:4, 409:5, 409:5-a, or 409:5-b, then:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by RSA 409:2, 409:3, 409:4, 409:5, 409:5-a, or 409:5-b;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this chapter, as determined by rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A.

<center><h3>Section 409:6</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:6 Method of Calculating Cash Surrender Values and Nonforfeiture Benefits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary.  All values referred to in RSA 409:3, 409:4, 409:5, 409:5-a, and 409:5-b may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death.  The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 409:3, additional benefits under the following circumstances shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this chapter;  and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event of total and permanent disability;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this chapter would not apply;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is 26, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of the death of a parent of the child;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:6-a Additional Standards. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This section, in addition to all other applicable sections of this chapter, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1985.  Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in the amount which does not differ by more than  2/10 of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years, from the sum of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The greater of zero and the basic cash value hereafter specified, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the company under the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as defined in paragraph III, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary.  Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in RSA 409:3 or 409:5, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in RSA 409:3 or 409:5, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in those sections.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in RSA 409:5 or 409:5-b, whichever is applicable.  Except as is required by paragraph IV of this section, such percentage:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (1) the fifth policy anniversary, and (2) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least  2/10 of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the 2 policy anniversaries specified in subparagraph (a) may apply to fewer than 5 consecutive policy years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in RSA 409:5 or 409:5-b, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other sections of this chapter.  The cash surrender values referred to in this section shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in RSA 409:2, 409:3, 409:4, 409:5-b and 409:6.  The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed in RSA 409:6, I-VI, shall conform with the principles of this section.
