&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 409:3 Minimum Cash Surrender Values. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by RSA 409:2, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of:  (a) the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in RSA 409:5, RSA 409:5-a and RSA 409:5-b, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, and (b) the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section, which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph I of this section shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of RSA 409:5-b as defined in that section, which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age 71, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph I of this section shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid-up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by RSA 409:2, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the company on the policy.
