<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purposes of this chapter, treatment of pervasive developmental disorder or autism as required under RSA 417-E:1, III(h) shall include the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Professional services and treatment programs, including applied behavioral analysis, necessary to produce socially significant improvements in human behavior or to prevent loss of attained skill or function.  To be eligible for coverage, applied behavior analysis must be provided by a person professionally certified by the national Behavior Analyst Certification Board or performed under the supervision of a person professionally certified by the national Behavior Analyst Certification Board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prescribed pharmaceuticals subject to the same terms and conditions of the policy as other prescribed pharmaceuticals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Direct or consultative services provided by a licensed professional including a licensed psychiatrist, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, licensed psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Services provided by a licensed speech therapist, licensed occupational therapist, or licensed physical therapist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An insurer may require submission of a treatment plan, including the frequency and duration of treatment, signed by the primary care provider, an appropriately credentialed treating specialist, a child psychiatrist, a pediatrician with a specialty in behavioral-developmental pediatrics, a neurologist with a specialty in child neurology, or a licensed psychologist with training in child psychology, that the treatment is medically necessary for the patient and is consistent with nationally recognized treatment standards for the condition such as those set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  An insurer may require an updated treatment plan no more frequently than on a semi-annual basis.  Coverage shall not be denied on the basis that services are habilitative in nature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The policy, contract, or certificate may limit coverage for applied behavior analysis to $36,000 per year for children 0 to 12 years of age, and $27,000 from ages 13 to 21.  An insurer may not apply payments for coverage unrelated to autism spectrum disorders to any maximum benefit established under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any obligation by a school district or the state of New Hampshire to provide services to an individual under an individualized family service plan or an individualized education program, as required under the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, the state children's health insurance program authorized by 42 U.S.C. section 1397aa et seq., or the provision of services to an individual under any other federal or state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the insurance coverage requirements established under this section.
