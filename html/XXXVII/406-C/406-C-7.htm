&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A financial institution shall, to the extent practicable, keep the area where the bank conducts transactions involving insurance products or annuities physically segregated from areas where retail deposits are routinely accepted from the general public, identify the areas where insurance product or annuity sales activities occur, and clearly delineate and distinguish those areas from the areas where the bank's retail deposit-taking activities occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Solicitation for the purchase or sale of insurance by a licensed employee who exercises authority over credit transactions shall be conducted in a manner which addresses the potential for customer confusion and coercion.

III. Signage, informational materials, and sales literature concerning the availability of insurance products through the financial institution shall be utilized and displayed in the manner required by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
