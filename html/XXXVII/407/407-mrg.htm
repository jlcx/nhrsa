If explanations of such reduced or eliminated coverages are not contained in the printed notice attached to its policies, then such coverages, conditions or definitions shall remain in full force and effect without such reductions or eliminations.

<b>Other perils or subjects.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Any other peril to be insured against or subject of insurance to be covered in this policy shall be by endorsement in writing hereon or added hereto.
<br>
<b>Added provisions.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The extent of the application of insurance under this policy and of the contribution to be made by this Company in case of loss, and any other provision or agreement not inconsistent with the provisions of this policy, may be provided for in writing added hereto, but no provision may be waived except such as by the terms of this policy is subject to change.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This policy shall be cancelled at any time at the request of the insured, in which case this Company shall, upon demand and surrender of this policy, refund the excess of paid premium above the customary short rates for the expired time.  This policy may be cancelled at any time by this Company by giving to the insured a 5 days' written notice of cancellation with or without tender of the excess of paid premium above the pro rata premium for the expired time, which excess, if not tendered, shall be refunded on demand.  Notice of cancellation shall state that said excess premium (if not tendered) will be refunded on demand.
<br>
<b>Mortgagee interests and obligations.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If the insured fails to render proof of loss such mortgagee, upon notice, shall render proof of loss in the form herein specified within 60 days thereafter and shall be subject to the provisions hereof relating to appraisal and time of payment and of bringing suit.  If this Company shall claim that no liability existed as to the mortgagor or owner, it shall, to the extent of payment of loss to the mortgagee, be subrogated to all the mortgagee's rights of recovery, but without impairing mortgagee's right to sue;  or it may pay off the mortgage debt and require an assignment thereof and of the mortgage.  Other provisions relating to the interests and obligations of such mortgagee may be added hereto by agreement in writing.
<br>
<b>Pro rata liability.</b>

This Company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss than the amount hereby insured shall bear to the whole insurance covering the property against the peril involved, whether collectible or not.

The insured shall give immediate written notice to this Company of any loss, protect the property from further damage, forthwith separate the damaged and undamaged personal property, put it in the best possible order, furnish a complete inventory of the destroyed, damaged and undamaged property, showing in detail quantities, costs, actual cash value and amount of loss claimed;  and within 60 days after the loss, unless such time is extended in writing by this Company, the insured shall render to this Company a proof of loss, signed and sworn to by the insured, stating the knowledge and belief of the insured as to the following:  the time and origin of the loss, the interest of the insured and of all others in the property, the actual cash value of each item thereof and the amount of loss thereto, all encumbrances thereon, all other contracts of insurance, whether valid or not, covering any of said property, any changes in the title, use, occupation, location, possession or exposures of said property since the issuing of this policy, by whom and for what purpose any building herein described and the several parts thereof were occupied at the time of loss and whether or not it then stood on leased ground, and shall furnish a copy of all the descriptions and schedules in all policies and, if required, verified plans and specifications of any building, fixtures or machinery destroyed or damaged.  The insured, as often as may be reasonably required, shall exhibit to any person designated by this Company all that remains of any property herein described, and submit to examinations under oath by any person named by this Company, and subscribe the same and, as often as may be reasonably required, shall produce for examination all books of account, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies thereof if originals be lost, at such reasonable time and place as may be designated by this Company or its representative, and shall permit extracts and copies thereof to be made.
<br>
<b>Appraisal.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In case the insured and this Company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss, then, on the written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of such demand.  The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire;  and failing for 15 days to agree upon such umpire, then, on request of the insured or this Company, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property covered is located.  The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item;  and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences, only, to the umpire.  An award in writing, so itemized, of any 2 when filed with this Company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss.  Each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him and the expenses of appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every insurer issuing a homeowner, condominium unit owner, residential tenant, and residential fire insurance policy that does not cover damage caused by flood shall notify the policyholder that the policy does not cover damage caused by flood.  The notice shall also inform the policyholder how to contact the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or the NFIP's agents.  The notice may be included with other materials sent to the policyholder, as a separate document or included on the declarations page of the policy.  The notice shall be provided:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At the time the policy is issued;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At the time the policy is renewed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The following statement, or language substantially similar, when combined with current information about how to contact the NFIP or its agent, satisfies the notice requirements of this section:
<br>
"This policy does not cover damage to your property caused by flooding.  The federal government offers flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program to residents of communities that participate in its program.  You can learn more about the National Flood Insurance Program at www.floodsmart.gov or by calling (888)379-9531.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The failure to comply with this section shall not invalidate a flood exclusion, or any other exclusion, in an insurance policy subject to this section.
