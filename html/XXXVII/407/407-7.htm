<codesect>
Appropriate forms of other contracts or endorsements, insuring against one or more of the perils incident to the ownership, use or occupancy of said property, other than fire and lightning, which the insurer is empowered to assume, may be used in connection with the Standard Fire Policy.  Such forms of other contracts or endorsements attached or printed thereon may contain provisions and stipulations inconsistent with the Standard Fire Policy if applicable only to such other perils.  The pages of the Standard Fire Policy may be renumbered and rearranged to provide space for the listing of rates and premiums for coverages.
