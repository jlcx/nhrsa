If any conditions of this form are construed to be more liberal than any other policy conditions relating to the perils of fire, lightning or removal, the conditions of this form shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In consideration of the provisions and stipulations herein or added hereto and of the premium above specified, this Company, for the term of years specified above from inception date shown above at 12:01 AM (Midnight, Standard Time) to expiration date shown above at 12:01 AM (Midnight, Standard Time) at location of property involved, to an amount not exceeding the amount(s) above specified, does insure the insured named above and legal representatives, to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss, but not exceeding the amount which it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after such loss, without allowance for any increased cost of repair or reconstruction by reason of any ordinance or law regulating construction or repair, and without compensation for loss resulting from interruption of business or manufacture, nor in any event for more than the interest of the insured, against all direct loss by fire, lightning and by removal from premises endangered by the perils insured against in this policy, except as hereinafter provided, to the property described herein while located or contained as described in this policy, or pro rata for 5 days at each proper place to which any of the property shall necessarily be removed for preservation from the perils insured against in this policy, but not elsewhere.  Assignment of this policy shall not be valid except with the written consent of this Company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This policy is made and accepted subject to the foregoing provisions and stipulations and those hereinafter stated, which are hereby made a part of this policy, together with such other provisions, stipulations and agreements as may be added hereto, as provided in this policy.
<br>
<b>Concealment, fraud.</b>

<br>
<b>Notice requirements.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In the event that a company or filing or rating organization eliminates or reduces coverages, conditions or definitions in its policies issued under this section other than at the request of a policyholder, the company must attach to the policy a printed notice in each such policy explaining clearly what coverages, conditions or definitions have been eliminated or reduced.  If explanations of such reduced or eliminated coverages are not contained in the printed notice attached to its policies, then such coverages, conditions or definitions shall remain in full force and effect without such reductions or eliminations.  The requirements of this section shall apply only to such policies renewed or endorsed with the same company.

<br>
<b>Other insurance.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Other insurance may be prohibited or the amount of insurance may be limited by endorsement attached hereto.
<br>
<b>Conditions suspending or restricting insurance.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Unless otherwise provided in writing added hereto this Company shall not be liable for loss occurring (a) while the hazard is increased by any means within the control or knowledge of the insured;  or (b) while a described building, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of 60 consecutive days;  or (c) as a result of explosion or riot, unless fire ensues, and in that event for loss by fire only.
<br>
<b>Other perils or subjects.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Any other peril to be insured against or subject of insurance to be covered in this policy shall be by endorsement in writing hereon or added hereto.
<br>
<b>Added provisions.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The extent of the application of insurance under this policy and of the contribution to be made by this Company in case of loss, and any other provision or agreement not inconsistent with the provisions of this policy, may be provided for in writing added hereto, but no provision may be waived except such as by the terms of this policy is subject to change.
<br>
<b>Waiver provisions.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
No permission affecting this insurance shall exist, or waiver of any provision be valid, unless granted herein or expressed in writing added hereto.  No provision, stipulation or forfeiture shall be held to be waived by any requirement or proceeding on the part of this Company relating to appraisal or to any examination provided for herein.
<br>
<b>Cancellation of policy.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This policy shall be cancelled at any time at the request of the insured, in which case this Company shall, upon demand and surrender of this policy, refund the excess of paid premium above the customary short rates for the expired time.  This policy may be cancelled at any time by this Company by giving to the insured a 5 days' written notice of cancellation with or without tender of the excess of paid premium above the pro rata premium for the expired time, which excess, if not tendered, shall be refunded on demand.  Notice of cancellation shall state that said excess premium (if not tendered) will be refunded on demand.
<br>
<b>Mortgagee interests and obligations.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If loss hereunder is made payable, in whole or in part, to a designated mortgagee not named herein as the insured, such interest in this policy may be cancelled by giving to such mortgagee a 10 days' written notice of cancellation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If the insured fails to render proof of loss such mortgagee, upon notice, shall render proof of loss in the form herein specified within 60 days thereafter and shall be subject to the provisions hereof relating to appraisal and time of payment and of bringing suit.  If this Company shall claim that no liability existed as to the mortgagor or owner, it shall, to the extent of payment of loss to the mortgagee, be subrogated to all the mortgagee's rights of recovery, but without impairing mortgagee's right to sue;  or it may pay off the mortgage debt and require an assignment thereof and of the mortgage.  Other provisions relating to the interests and obligations of such mortgagee may be added hereto by agreement in writing.
<br>
<b>Pro rata liability.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This Company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss than the amount hereby insured shall bear to the whole insurance covering the property against the peril involved, whether collectible or not.
<br>
<b>Requirements in case loss occurs.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The insured shall give immediate written notice to this Company of any loss, protect the property from further damage, forthwith separate the damaged and undamaged personal property, put it in the best possible order, furnish a complete inventory of the destroyed, damaged and undamaged property, showing in detail quantities, costs, actual cash value and amount of loss claimed;  and within 60 days after the loss, unless such time is extended in writing by this Company, the insured shall render to this Company a proof of loss, signed and sworn to by the insured, stating the knowledge and belief of the insured as to the following:  the time and origin of the loss, the interest of the insured and of all others in the property, the actual cash value of each item thereof and the amount of loss thereto, all encumbrances thereon, all other contracts of insurance, whether valid or not, covering any of said property, any changes in the title, use, occupation, location, possession or exposures of said property since the issuing of this policy, by whom and for what purpose any building herein described and the several parts thereof were occupied at the time of loss and whether or not it then stood on leased ground, and shall furnish a copy of all the descriptions and schedules in all policies and, if required, verified plans and specifications of any building, fixtures or machinery destroyed or damaged.  The insured, as often as may be reasonably required, shall exhibit to any person designated by this Company all that remains of any property herein described, and submit to examinations under oath by any person named by this Company, and subscribe the same and, as often as may be reasonably required, shall produce for examination all books of account, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies thereof if originals be lost, at such reasonable time and place as may be designated by this Company or its representative, and shall permit extracts and copies thereof to be made.
<br>
<b>Appraisal.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In case the insured and this Company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss, then, on the written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of such demand.  The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire;  and failing for 15 days to agree upon such umpire, then, on request of the insured or this Company, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property covered is located.  The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item;  and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences, only, to the umpire.  An award in writing, so itemized, of any 2 when filed with this Company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss.  Each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him and the expenses of appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally.
<br>
<b>Company's options.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
It shall be optional with this Company to take all, or any part, of the property at the agreed or appraised value, and also to repair, rebuild or replace the property destroyed or damaged with other of like kind and quality within a reasonable time, on giving notice of its intention so to do within 30 days after the receipt of the proof of loss herein required.
<br>
<b>Abandonment.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
There can be no abandonment to this Company of any property.
<br>
<b>When loss payable.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The amount of loss for which this Company may be liable shall be payable 60 days after proof of loss, as herein provided, is received by this Company and ascertainment of the loss is made either by agreement between the insured and this Company expressed in writing or by the filing with this Company of an award as herein provided.
<br>
<b>Suit.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
No suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with, and unless commenced within 12 months next after inception of the loss.
<br>
<b>Subrogation.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This Company may require from the insured an assignment of all right of recovery against any party for loss to the extent that payment therefor is made by this Company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In Witness Whereof, this Company has executed and attested these presents;  but this policy shall not be valid unless countersigned by the duly authorized Agent of this Company at the agency hereinbefore mentioned.
