&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-K:2 Establishment of the Pool. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established a nonprofit entity to be known as the "New Hampshire small employer health reinsurance pool.''  All health carriers, writers of health insurance, and other insurers issuing or maintaining health insurance in this state shall be members of the pool.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. On or before July 1, 2005, the commissioner shall give notice to all members of the pool of the time and place for the initial organizational meeting, which shall take place by July 15, 2005.  The members shall select the initial board at the organizational meeting and such initial board shall be subject to approval by the commissioner.  The members shall elect each subsequent board at the annual meeting of members and each such subsequent board shall be subject to approval by the commissioner.  The initial board and each subsequent board shall consist of at least 5 and not more than 9 representatives of members.  There shall be no more than one board member on the initial board and each subsequent board representing any one member company.  In determining voting rights at the organizational meeting and all subsequent meetings of members, each member shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy. All such votes shall be proportional to the member's covered lives.  To the extent possible, at least  2/3 of members of each board shall be small employer health carriers.  At least one member of each board shall be a small employer health carrier with less than $100,000,000 in net small employer health insurance premium in this state.  The commissioner, or designee, shall be an ex-officio voting member of the board.  In approving selection of each board, the commissioner shall assure that all members are fairly represented.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the initial board is not elected at the organizational meeting, the commissioner shall appoint the initial board within 15 days of the organizational meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 60 days after the appointment of such initial board, the board shall submit to the commissioner a plan of operation and thereafter any amendments to the plan necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool.  The commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, approve the plan of operation provided he or she determines it to be suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool, and provides for the sharing of pool gains or losses on an equitable proportionate basis in accordance with the provisions of paragraph VI of this section.  The plan of operation shall become effective upon approval in writing by the commissioner consistent with the date on which the coverage under this section shall be made available.  If the board fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within 60 days after its appointment, or at any time thereafter fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan of operation, the commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate a plan of operation or amendments no later than October 1, 2005.  The commissioner shall amend any plan adopted by him or her, as necessary at the time a plan of operation is submitted by the board and approved by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall select reinsurance pool administrators through a competitive bidding process to administer the pool.  The board shall evaluate bids submitted based on criteria established by the board.  Each month, total payments to administrators shall not exceed the larger of $2,500 or an amount equal to $10 per life for which the reinsurance pool has any potential claims liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The plan of operation shall establish procedures for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Handling and accounting of assets and moneys of the pool, and for annual fiscal reporting to the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Filling vacancies on the board, subject to the approval of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Selecting an administrator and setting forth the powers and duties of the administrator.

(d) Reinsuring risks in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Collecting assessments from all members to provide for claims reinsured by the pool and for administrative expenses incurred or estimated to be incurred during the period for which the assessment is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any additional matters at the discretion of the board.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h3>Section 420-K:6</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-K:6 Assessments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Following the close of each fiscal year, the administrator shall determine the net premiums, the pool expenses of administration and the incurred losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Each member's assessment for the reinsurance pool shall be based on its number of covered lives times a specified assessment rate.  The board of directors shall specify the basis used to set the assessment rate.  The board of directors shall establish a regular assessment rate, which shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Calculated on a calendar year basis based on the net losses from the audited financial statements of the prior fiscal year;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Established no later than November 1 in the current fiscal year;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Anticipated to be sufficient to meet the pool's funding needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In addition to the regular assessment rate, the board may establish a special assessment rate for organizational expenses and to pay claims reinsured by the pool.  Notwithstanding RSA 420-G:4, a writer of health insurance may increase the premiums charged by the amount of the special assessment.  Any assessment may appear as a separate line item on a policyholder's bill.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The board shall only establish an interim assessment if the board determines that its funds are or will become insufficient to pay the reinsurance pool's expense or claims reinsured by the pool, in a timely manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The regular assessment rate, and any special assessment rate, shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner.  The commissioner shall approve the rate if he or she finds that the amount is required to fulfill the purpose of the reinsurance pool.  For the purpose of making this determination, the commissioner may, at the expense of the pool, seek independent actuarial certification of the need for the proposed rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The board shall impose and collect assessments on members of the pool.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the assessment exceeds the amount actually needed, the excess shall be held and invested and, with the earnings and interest thereon, be used to offset future net losses.  Each covered life shall be included in the assessment on an aggregate basis and procedures shall be maintained to ensure that no covered life is counted more than once.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Provision shall be made in the plan of operation for the imposition of an interest penalty for late payment of assessments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.  In the event an assessment against a member insurer is deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which such assessment is deferred may be assessed against the other members in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this chapter.  The member insurer receiving such deferral shall remain liable to the pool for the amount deferred.  The board may attach appropriate conditions to any such deferral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board shall have the authority to continue to impose and collect assessments pursuant to this section until the obligations of the pool have been satisfied in full.  The board shall submit an annual report to the commissioner, in a manner and form determined by the commissioner, listing the association membership base, providing a count of covered lives by member, identifying changes in association membership and covered lives, describing the collection of assessments, listing payment delinquencies, and containing such other related information as the commissioner may require.  The commissioner shall annually review the report on association membership, covered lives, and the payment of assessments to ensure that all insurers that should be members of the association are participating in the association and that all association members have accurately reported covered lives and paid the proper assessment.  The board shall remedy any problem identified by the commissioner with respect to membership in the association, reporting of covered lives, or payment of the assessment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-K:7 Immunity and Indemnification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Neither the participation in the pool as members, the establishment of rates, forms, or procedures, nor any other joint or collective action required by this chapter shall be the basis of any legal action against the pool or any of its members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person or member made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding because the person or member served on the board or on a committee or was an officer or employee of the pool shall be held harmless and be indemnified by the pool against all liability and costs, including the amounts of judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, and expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding.  The indemnification shall not be provided on any matter in which the person or member is finally adjudged in the action, suit, or proceeding to have committed a breach of duty involving gross negligence, dishonesty, willful misfeasance, or reckless disregard of the responsibilities of office.  Costs and expenses of the indemnification shall be prorated and paid for by all members.  The right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of other rights or defenses to which such person or the legal representative or successors of such person, may be entitled to as a matter of law.  The commissioner may retain actuarial consultants necessary to carry out his or her responsibilities pursuant to this chapter and such expenses shall be paid by the pool established in this chapter.
