&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Neither the participation in the pool as members, the establishment of rates, forms, or procedures, nor any other joint or collective action required by this chapter shall be the basis of any legal action against the pool or any of its members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person or member made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding because the person or member served on the board or on a committee or was an officer or employee of the pool shall be held harmless and be indemnified by the pool against all liability and costs, including the amounts of judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, and expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding.  The indemnification shall not be provided on any matter in which the person or member is finally adjudged in the action, suit, or proceeding to have committed a breach of duty involving gross negligence, dishonesty, willful misfeasance, or reckless disregard of the responsibilities of office.  Costs and expenses of the indemnification shall be prorated and paid for by all members.  The right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of other rights or defenses to which such person or the legal representative or successors of such person, may be entitled to as a matter of law.  The commissioner may retain actuarial consultants necessary to carry out his or her responsibilities pursuant to this chapter and such expenses shall be paid by the pool established in this chapter.
