<codesect>
Beginning January 1, 2006 and ending June 30, 2008, members may reinsure with the pool health coverage provided to small employers as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The pool shall reinsure the level of coverage provided up to, but not exceeding, the level of coverage provided in the standard health benefit plan or the actuarial equivalent thereof as defined and authorized by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The pool shall not reimburse a ceding carrier with respect to claims of a reinsured employee or dependent until the carrier has incurred an initial level of claims for such employee or dependent of at least $5,000 in a calendar year for benefits covered by the standard health benefit plan.  The amount of the deductible shall be periodically reviewed by the board and may be adjusted upward as determined by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A member may reinsure an entire small employer group within a period of 60 days following the small employer's health insurance policy issue date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A member may reinsure an eligible employee or dependent of a small employer group:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Within a period of 60 days following the small employer's health insurance policy issue date;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) On the first plan anniversary after the coverage has been in effect for a period of 3 years, and every third plan anniversary thereafter;  provided, that reinsurance pursuant to this subparagraph shall only be permitted with respect to eligible employees and their dependents of a small employer which has no more than 5 eligible employees as of the applicable anniversary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A member may reinsure a newly eligible employee or dependent of a small employer group within a period of 60 days following the commencement of his or her coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Reinsurance coverage may be terminated for each reinsured employee or dependent on any plan anniversary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Reinsurance of newborn dependents shall be allowed only if the mother of any such dependent is reinsured as of the date of birth of such child, and all newborn dependents of reinsured persons shall be automatically reinsured as of their date of birth.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs III and IV:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Coverage for eligible employees and their dependents provided under a group policy covering 2 or more small employers shall not be eligible for reinsurance when such coverage is discontinued and replaced by a group policy of another carrier covering 2 or more small employers, unless coverage for such eligible employees or dependents was reinsured by the prior carrier;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At the time coverage is assumed for such group by a succeeding carrier, such carrier shall notify the pool of its intention to provide coverage for such group and shall identify the employees and dependents whose coverage will continue to be reinsured.  The time limitations for providing such notice shall be established by the pool.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall establish a methodology for determining premium rates to be charged for reinsuring small employers and individuals.  The methodology shall include a system for classification of small employers that reflects the way case characteristics are commonly used by small employer carriers in the state.  Pool reinsurance premiums shall be established at the following percentages of the base reinsurance premium rate established by the pool for that classification of small employers with similar case characteristics:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An entire small employer group consisting of 2 or more employees may be reinsured for a rate that is 150 percent of the applicable base reinsurance premium rate for the group established pursuant to RSA 420-K:4, II;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An eligible employee or dependent may be reinsured for a rate that is 500 percent of the applicable base reinsurance premium rate for the individual established pursuant to RSA 420-K:4, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. On or before December 1, 2005, the board shall establish, subject to the approval of the commissioner, a standard reinsurance underwriting form for use by small employer carriers in ceding risks to the pool.  The form may be amended from time to time as the board deems necessary, subject to the approval of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Reinsurance coverage under this chapter shall terminate on December 31, 2008.  Reinsurance shall be provided only for covered claims submitted within 2 years from the date the expenses on which the claim is based were incurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. A member who reinsured an eligible employee or dependent with an initial coverage date or anniversary date on or after January 1, 2008 may elect to terminate coverage for the eligible employee or dependent retroactive to the applicable initial coverage date or anniversary date occurring on or after January 1, 2008.  These elections shall be made no later than July 1, 2008.  The pool shall reimburse the member for the premium paid on behalf of the eligible employee or eligible dependent and the member shall reimburse the pool for any claims paid by the pool on behalf of the eligible employee or eligible dependent.
