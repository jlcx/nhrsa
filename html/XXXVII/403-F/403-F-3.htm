<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A mutual insurance company may reorganize as a mutual insurance holding company system consisting of a mutual insurance holding company and a subsidiary insurance company.  The reorganization may be effected by the organization of one or more companies, amendment or restatement of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of one or more companies, transfer of assets and liabilities among 2 or more companies, issuance, acquisition or transfer of capital stock of one or more companies, or merger or consolidation of 2 or more companies.  The mutual insurance holding company shall at all times own a majority of the voting shares and a majority in economic value of the capital stock of each controlled subsidiary and any intermediate stock holding company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All of the initial shares of the capital stock of the insurance company which reorganized as a subsidiary insurance company shall be issued either to the mutual insurance holding company or to an intermediate holding company which is wholly owned by the mutual insurance holding company.  This restriction shall not preclude the subsequent issuance of additional shares of stock by the subsidiary insurance company so long as the requirements of paragraph I are not violated.  The membership interests of the policyholders of the subsidiary insurance company shall become membership interests in the mutual insurance holding company.  Policyholders of the subsidiary insurance company which was formerly the mutual insurer shall be members of the mutual insurance holding company in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the mutual insurance holding company.
