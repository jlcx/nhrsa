The plan may provide for conditions under which the converted insurer may cease to maintain the closed block and its allocated assets.  Regardless of such a cessation, the obligation under the policies constituting the closed block business remain the obligations of the converted insurer.  Dividends on those policies shall be apportioned by the board of directors of the converted insurer in accordance with the terms of the policies.
