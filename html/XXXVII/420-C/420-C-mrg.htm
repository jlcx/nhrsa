<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-a. A maternity benefits rider for covered persons who request it, if maternity benefits are not part of the health benefits plan.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to apply to supplemental health insurance and disability insurance policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. No preferred provider shall, when issuing or renewing a policy or contract of insurance or any certificate under such policy or contract covered by this chapter, deny coverage or limit coverage to any resident of this state on the basis of health risk or condition except that a waiting period consistent with insurance department rules may be imposed for pre-existing medical conditions.  If a preferred provider accepts an application for group coverage, such acceptance shall be subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the group has coverage in effect through another plan, the preferred provider shall accept all persons covered under the existing plan.  If the group does not have coverage in effect through another plan, the preferred provider shall accept all persons for which the group seeks coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Once a group policy has been issued, any person becoming eligible for coverage shall become covered by enrolling within 31 days after first becoming eligible.  Any person so enrolling shall not be required to submit evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  If a person does not enroll at this time, he is a late enrollee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Once a group policy has been issued, the preferred provider shall provide the group with an annual open enrollment period for late enrollees.  During the open enrollment period, any late enrollee shall be permitted to enroll without submitting any evidence of insurability based on medical conditions.  For late enrollees only, the pre-existing condition provisions shall apply for 18 months from the date of enrollment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. An insurer issuing policies of group insurance shall allocate the costs associated with maternity and childbirth over both males and females covered by its entire block of business in this state.  In cases in which, because of the amount written in the state, allocation to an entire block of business needs to occur, the carrier may apply for a waiver from the insurance commissioner.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In the event a carrier elects to provide coverage for dependent children, the term "dependent child'' shall include a subscriber's child by blood or by law, who is under age 26.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The coverage of any family member insured by such policy, pursuant to paragraph I, who is mentally or physically incapable of earning his or her own living as of the date on which such dependent's status as a covered family member would otherwise expire because of age, shall continue under such policy while such policy remains in force or is replaced by another policy as long as such incapacity continues and as long as such dependent remains chiefly financially dependent on the policyholder or the employee or his or her estate is chargeable for the care of such dependent;  provided, that due proof of such incapacity is received by the insurer within 31 days of such expiration date.  If such coverage is continued in accordance with this paragraph, such dependent shall be entitled upon the termination of such incapacity to coverage offered by the New Hampshire high risk pool under RSA 404-G.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Coverage for services provided to a dependent before the effective date of this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That an employer pay all or part of the cost of family coverage that includes a dependent as provided pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A subscriber that elects family coverage during any applicable open enrollment period may enroll any dependent eligible pursuant to this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The date upon which the employer under whose contract coverage is provided to a dependent ceases to provide coverage to the subscriber.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a health insurance carrier to refuse an election for coverage by a dependent pursuant to paragraph III, based upon the dependent's prior disqualification pursuant to subparagraph IV(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Notice regarding coverage for a dependent as provided pursuant to this section shall be provided to a subscriber:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h3>Section 420-C:4-b</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 420-C:4-b Coverage for Dependents. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the coverage for dependent children includes coverage for dependent children who are full-time students, as defined by the appropriate educational institution, beyond the age of 18, such dependent coverage shall include coverage for a dependent's medically necessary leave of absence from school for a period not to exceed 12 months or the date on which coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy, whichever comes first.  Any breaks in the school semester shall not disqualify the dependent child from coverage under this section.  Documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be submitted to the insurer by the student's attending physician and shall be considered prima facie evidence of entitlement to coverage under this section.  The date of the documentation and certification of the medical necessity of a leave of absence shall be the date the insurance coverage under this section commences.

<codesect>
In the event that a person is covered by more than one plan that requires pre-certification, the member shall obtain pre-certification from the primary plan.  Although the member shall not be required to obtain pre-certification from the secondary plan, the secondary plan shall not be required to treat such services as covered services if the services do not meet its certification criteria.  The secondary plan shall not refuse payment for such services solely on the basis that the services were not pre-certified by the secondary plan.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No contract between a health care insurer and a physician, for the purpose of delineating the rights and obligations of the parties within the provider network, shall limit the liability of the health care insurer for any actions of the physician for which the health care insurer might otherwise be liable.
<br>
