In the case of such failure, the licensee shall notify the claimant or claimant's representative within 24 hours of receipt of the claim and shall advise the claimant or claimant's representative of the specific information necessary to determine the claim.  The claimant or claimant's representative shall be afforded a reasonable amount of time, taking into account the circumstances, but not less than 48 hours, to provide the specified information.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
