<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Within 15 days after making the notification required by paragraphs I, II, and III, the insurer shall mail a copy of the notification to the producer at his or her last known address.

(2) Receive documents, materials, or information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, its affiliates or subsidiaries, and from regulatory and law enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, material, or information received with notice of the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material, or information;  and may enter into agreements governing sharing and use of information consistent with this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials or information shall occur as a result of disclosure to the commissioner under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized herein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the commissioner from releasing final, adjudicated actions including for cause terminations that are open to public inspection pursuant to RSA 91-A to a database or other clearinghouse service maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, its affiliates or subsidiaries.
