<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless denied licensure pursuant to RSA 402-J:12, a nonresident shall receive a nonresident producer license if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person is currently licensed as a resident and in good standing in his or her home state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person has submitted the proper request for licensure and has paid the fees required by RSA 400-A:29.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person has submitted or transmitted to the commissioner the application for licensure that the person submitted to his or her home state, or in lieu of same, a completed uniform application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The person's home state awards nonresident producer licenses to residents of this state on the same basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A nonresident producer who moves from one state to another state or a resident producer who moves from this state to another state shall file a change of address and provide certification from the new resident state within 30 days of the change of legal residence.  No license application or license fee is required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may verify the producer's licensing status through the producer database maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, its affiliates or subsidiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a person licensed as a surplus lines producer in his or her home state shall receive a nonresident surplus lines producer license pursuant to paragraph I of this section.  Except as provided in paragraph I, nothing in this section otherwise amends or supersedes any provision of RSA 405:24 through RSA 405:31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a person licensed as a limited line credit insurance or other type of limited lines producer in his or her home state shall receive a nonresident limited lines producer license, pursuant to paragraph I of this section, granting the same scope of authority as granted under the license issued by the producer's home state.  For the purposes of this paragraph, limited line insurance is any authority granted by the home state which restricts the authority of the license to less than the total authority prescribed in the associated major lines pursuant to RSA 402-J:7, I(a)-(g).
