I. An operating agreement may provide for the removal of a member by any method or procedure and for any reason.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unless the operating agreement provides a method or procedure and standard for removal of a member, then, on application by any member to the superior court and after notice to the member sought to be removed under the provisions of paragraph IV:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The court may remove a member by judicial order if (1) the member has breached a duty to the limited liability company;  (2) the breach has caused material injury to the limited liability company;  and (3) if the breach is capable of being remedied, the member has failed to remedy the breach within a reasonable time after receiving notice of it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The court may remove a member by judicial order if (1) the member has engaged in any other conduct that has caused material injury to the limited liability company;  and (2) if the injury is capable of being remedied, the member has failed to remedy the injury within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the injury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The court may remove a member by judicial order if the member has engaged, or is engaging, in conduct relating to the limited liability company's activities that make it not reasonably practicable to carry on the activities of the limited liability company with the person as a member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In responding to an application under paragraph II, the court shall have discretion to provide relief to the applicant, the limited liability company, or the member sought to be removed other than the removal of the member sought to be removed, including the discretion to order a redemption or cross-purchase of all or any part of the membership rights of any member or members of the limited liability company on terms determined by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For purposes of this section, timely written notice shall mean a written notice given by the limited liability company or another member to the member sought to be removed.

<center><h3>Section 304-C:126</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-C:126 Charging Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of (a) a member of a limited liability company (the "debtor-member'') or (b) a transferee of all or any part of a member's limited liability company interest (a "transferee''), the court may enter a charging order against the limited liability company in respect of the limited liability company interest of the debtor-member or the transferee for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment plus interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A charging order constitutes a lien on a debtor-member's or transferee's limited liability company interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Under a charging order, a judgment creditor has only the right to receive distributions to which the debtor-member or transferee would otherwise have been entitled from the limited liability company, and only to the extent of the judgment, including interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A judgment debtor that obtains a charging order does not thereby become the holder of the debtor-member's or transferee's limited liability company interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This section does not deprive any judgment debtor of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the judgment debtor's membership rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except as provided in paragraphs VI and VII, a charging order is the sole and exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a debtor-member may satisfy a judgment from a debtor-member's membership rights or from the assets of a limited liability company.  This section is not exclusive as to the rights of creditors with respect to the limited liability company interests of transferees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The remedy of execution upon a debtor-member's membership rights shall be unavailable to a judgment creditor attempting to satisfy a judgment against a debtor-member of a multi-member limited liability company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as provided in paragraph VI, the remedy of execution upon a debtor-member's membership rights shall be unavailable to a judgment creditor attempting to satisfy a judgment against a debtor-member of a single-member limited liability company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) If a judgment creditor shows to the satisfaction of a court of competent jurisdiction that distributions under a charging order in respect of the limited liability company interest of a debtor-member of a single-member limited liability company will not satisfy the judgment within a reasonable time, a charging order shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy by which the judgment creditor may satisfy the judgment against the member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon such a showing, the court may order the sale of the debtor-member's membership rights under an execution sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A judgment creditor may make a showing to the court under subparagraph (a) that distributions under a charging order will not satisfy a judgment either (1) when the judgment creditor applies for the entry of a charging order under a member of a single-member limited liability company or (2) at any time thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If, under paragraph VI, a court orders an execution sale of the membership rights of a debtor-member that is the member of a single-member limited liability company:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The purchaser shall obtain all of the member's membership rights and not merely the rights of an transferee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The purchaser shall become the member of the limited liability company;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The debtor-member whose membership rights have been sold shall cease to be a member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Nothing in this section shall limit:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The rights of a creditor that has been granted a consensual security interest in the limited liability company interest or other membership rights of a member to pursue the remedies available to the secured creditor under other law applicable to secured creditors;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The principles of law and equity which affect fraudulent transfers;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The availability of the equitable principles of veil-piercing, equitable lien, or constructive trust, or other equitable principles not inconsistent with this section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The continuing jurisdiction of the court to enforce its charging order in a manner consistent with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In any action in a court of this state in which a judgment creditor seeks a charging order against a member or transferee of a foreign limited liability company, this section shall apply.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The limited liability company shall commence the proceeding in superior court of the county where the limited liability company's principal executive office or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(a) Instead of remitting a payment under RSA 304-C:166, the limited liability company shall forward to the dissenting member:

(3) A statement of that allocation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the dissenting member accepts the amount of the offer made under RSA 304-C:166 but disputes the allocation, the dissenter shall promptly so notify the limited liability company and within 60 days after the notification commence a proceeding and petition the court to determine the proper allocation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The dissenting member shall commence the proceeding in superior court of the county in which the principal office of the limited liability company or, if none, its registered office, is located, or in the case of a surviving foreign limited liability company or other entity that is complying with this section following a merger with or conversion of a limited liability company, the member shall commence the proceeding in superior court of the county in this state in which the last registered office of the limited liability company was located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The petition filed under subparagraph IV(b) shall name as parties the member, the limited liability company and all transferees of the member's limited liability interest.  Upon being served with the petition, the limited liability company shall promptly pay into the court the amount offered under subparagraph IV(a) and shall then be dismissed from the proceeding.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-C:188 Right to Bring Actions on Behalf Of Limited Liability Companies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A member or members may bring an action in the superior court in the right of a limited liability company to recover a judgment in its favor if managers or members with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those managers or members to bring the action is not likely to succeed, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All such plaintiff members are members at the time of bringing such action;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) All such plaintiff members are members at the time of the transaction of which the plaintiffs complain;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The plaintiffs' status as members had devolved on the plaintiffs by operation of law or under the terms of a limited liability company agreement from persons who were members at the time of the transaction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The complaint sets forth with particularity the effort, if any, of the plaintiff to secure initiation of the action by a manager or member or the reasons for not making the effort.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unless the operating agreement provide otherwise, an action on behalf of the limited liability company may be brought in the name of the limited liability company:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whether or not a limited liability company agreement vests management of the limited liability company in one or more managers, by majority vote of the members;  provided that the vote of any member who has an interest in the outcome of the suit that is adverse to the interest of the limited liability company shall be excluded;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the limited liability company agreement vests management of the limited liability company in one or more managers, by one or more managers of the limited liability company upon a majority vote of the members;  provided that in determining whether this member voting requirement is met, the vote of any member who has an interest in the outcome of the suit that is adverse to the interest of the limited liability company shall be excluded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If an action brought under paragraph I or II is successful, in whole or in part, as a result of a judgment, compromise, or settlement of the action, the court may award the plaintiff reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, from any recovery in the action or from the limited liability company.
