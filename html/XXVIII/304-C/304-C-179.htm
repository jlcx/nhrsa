&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That the foreign limited liability company surrenders its certificate of registration to transact business in this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That the foreign limited liability company revokes the authority of its registered agent for service of process in this state and consents that service of process in any action, suit, or proceeding based upon any cause of action arising in this state during the time the foreign limited liability company was authorized to do business in this state may thereafter be made on such foreign limited liability company by service of the action, suit, or proceeding upon the secretary of state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An address to which a person may mail a copy of any process against the foreign limited liability company;  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The application for cancellation shall be in the form and manner designated by the secretary of state and shall be signed on behalf of the foreign limited liability company by a person with authority to do so under the laws of the state or other jurisdiction of its formation, or, if the foreign limited liability company is in the hands of a receiver, trustee, or other court-appointed fiduciary, by that fiduciary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A cancellation does not terminate the authority of the secretary of state to accept service of process on the foreign limited liability company with respect to causes of action arising out of the doing of business in this state.
