<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An entity whose business organization form is that of a limited liability company under this act may make a statutory conversion of its business organization form to another business organization form authorized by applicable statute upon (1) the authorization of the statutory conversion in accordance with this section;  and (2) the fulfillment of the requirements for a statutory conversion under the statute governing entities having the other business organization form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the limited liability company agreement specifies the manner of authorizing a statutory conversion of a business entity that is a limited liability company under this act, the statutory conversion shall be authorized as specified in the limited liability company agreement of that entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the limited liability company agreement of the limited liability company referred to in paragraph II does not specify the manner of authorizing a statutory conversion of the limited liability company and does not prohibit a statutory conversion of the limited liability company, the statutory conversion shall be authorized in the same manner as is specified in the limited liability company agreement for authorizing a merger that involves the limited liability company as a constituent party to the merger.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the limited liability company agreement of the limited liability company referred to in paragraph II does not specify the manner of authorizing a statutory conversion of the limited liability company or a merger that involves the limited liability company as a constituent party and does not prohibit a statutory conversion of the limited liability company, the statutory conversion shall be authorized by majority vote of the members of the limited liability company, or, if there is more than one class or group of members, then by each class or group of members, in either case, by majority vote of the members in each class or group.
