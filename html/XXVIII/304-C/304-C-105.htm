&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless the operating agreement provides otherwise, any member, upon dissociation under RSA 304-C:100, RSA 304-C:101, or RSA 304-C:102, is entitled to receive any accrued distribution to which the member was entitled at the time of dissociation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unless the operating agreement provides otherwise, a dissociating member is not entitled to receive any payment for the value of the member's membership rights, including the member's limited liability company interest, as of the date of dissociation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a dissociated member receives no payment for the value of the member's membership rights, including the member's limited liability company interest, the dissociated member shall continue to have the rights of a transferee of a limited liability company interest under RSA 304-C:123, subject to the limited liability company's right of offset under RSA 304-C:103, III.
