&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each constituent entity, except the surviving entity, shall cease to exist;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The surviving entity shall thereupon and thereafter possess all the rights, privileges, immunities, and powers of each constituent entity and shall be subject to all the restrictions, disabilities, and duties of each of such constituent entities to the extent such rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, restrictions, disabilities, and duties are applicable to the type of business entity that is the surviving entity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account, including promises to make capital contributions and subscriptions for shares, and all other related claims, and all and every other interest of or belonging to or due to each of the constituent entities shall be vested in the surviving entity without further act or deed;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. As of the effective date the surviving entity shall be liable for all liabilities and obligations of each of the constituent entities so merged, and any claim existing or action or proceeding pending by or against any such constituent entity may be prosecuted as if such merger had not taken place, or the surviving entity may be substituted in the action;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Neither the rights of creditors nor any liens on the property of any constituent entity shall be impaired by the merger;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
