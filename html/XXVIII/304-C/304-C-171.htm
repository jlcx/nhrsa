&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-C:171 Allocations of Court Costs and Counsel Fees in Appraisal Actions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under RSA 304-C:170 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court.  The court shall assess the costs against the limited liability company, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily or not in good faith in demanding payment under RSA 304-C:169.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Against the limited liability company and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the limited liability company did not substantially comply with the requirements of RSA 304-C:161 through RSA 304-C:169.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Against either the limited liability company or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the limited liability company, the court may award to these counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amount awarded to the dissenters who were benefited.
