<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a demand for payment under RSA 304-C:169 remains unsettled, the limited liability company shall commence a proceeding within 60 days after receiving the payment demand and petition the superior court to determine the fair value of the limited liability company interest and accrued interest.  If the limited liability company does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The limited liability company shall commence the proceeding in superior court of the county where the limited liability company's principal executive office or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the limited liability company is a surviving foreign entity without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the registered office of the domestic limited liability company merged or converted into with the foreign limited liability company was located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The limited liability company shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding as in an action against their limited liability company interests, and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition.  Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under paragraph I is plenary and exclusive.  The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value.  The appraisers shall have the powers described in the order appointing them, or in any amendment to it.  The dissenters shall be entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding shall be entitled to judgment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter's membership rights plus accrued interest exceeds the amount paid by the limited liability company;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the fair value, plus accrued interest, of such dissenter's after-acquired membership rights for which the limited liability company elected to withhold payment under RSA 304-C:168.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The limited liability company shall be entitled to judgment against each specific dissenter for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of such dissenter's membership rights, plus accrued interest, is less than the amount paid by the limited liability company to each dissenter.
