In addition to any other provisions in this act that govern documents filed with the secretary of state, the following rules shall apply to these documents:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The document shall contain the information required by this act.  It may contain other information as well.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The document shall be typewritten or printed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The document shall be in the English language.  However, a limited liability company name need not be in English if written in English letters or Arabic or Roman numerals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this act, the document shall be signed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
