&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A dissenter may notify the limited liability company in writing of the dissenter's own estimate of the fair value of such dissenter's limited liability company interest and amount of interest due, and demand payment of the dissenter's estimate, less any payment under RSA 304-C:166, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The dissenter believes that the amount paid under RSA 304-C:166 is less than the fair value of the dissenter's limited liability company interest or that the interest due is incorrectly calculated;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The limited liability company fails to make payment under RSA 304-C:166 within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A dissenter waives the right to demand payment under this section unless the dissenter notifies the limited liability company of the dissenter's demand in writing under paragraph I within 30 days after the limited liability company made or offered payment for such dissenter's limited liability company interest.
