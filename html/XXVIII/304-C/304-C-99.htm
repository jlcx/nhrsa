<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If, after dissociation, a former member retains all or any part of the former member's limited liability company interest, the former member shall be entitled to the following rights:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Subject to reasonable restrictions as determined from time to time by the limited liability company, the former member shall be entitled to inspect and copy at the former member's own expense all information reasonably relevant to allocations and distributions to the former member in respect of the former member's limited liability company interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless the operating agreement provides otherwise, the former member may invoke the dispute resolution provisions of RSA 304-C:186 with respect to the former member's limited liability company interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Subject to any contrary provision in paragraph IV or RSA 304-C:106 through RSA 304-C:117 and unless the operating agreement provides otherwise, a member who has been dissociated from a limited liability company shall have no fiduciary or other duties to the limited liability company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person who has been dissociated from the limited liability company shall have no liabilities to the limited liability company except liabilities that accrued to the member before the member's dissociation and that were not discharged before or concurrent with the member's dissociation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless the operating agreement provides otherwise, former members and transferees of the limited liability company interests of former members may claim in the superior court under the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing that they are entitled to fiduciary rights against the limited liability company and its members.
