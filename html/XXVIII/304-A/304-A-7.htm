&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-A:7 Rules for Determining the Existence of a Partnership. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In determining whether a partnership exists, these rules shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided by RSA 304-A:16, persons who are not partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership, whether such co-owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The sharing of gross returns does not of itself establish a partnership, whether or not the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in any property from which the returns are derived.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but no such inference shall be drawn if such profits were received in payment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As a debt by installments or otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) As wages of an employee or rent to a landlord.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) As an annuity to a widow or representative of a deceased partner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) As interest on a loan, though the amount of payment vary with the profits of the business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) As the consideration for the sale of a goodwill of a business or other property by installments or otherwise.
