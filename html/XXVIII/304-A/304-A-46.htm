II. The reservation of a specified name shall be made by filing with the secretary of state an application, executed by the applicant, to reserve a specified name.  If the secretary of state finds that the name meets the requirements of RSA 304-A:45, II and III, the secretary of state shall reserve the name for the exclusive use of the applicant for a period of 120 days.  Once having so reserved a name, the same applicant may again reserve the same name for successive 120-day periods.  The right to the exclusive use of a reserved name may be transferred to any other person by filing with the secretary of state a notice of the transfer, executed by the applicant for whom the name was reserved, specifying the name to be transferred and the name and address of the transferee.  The reservation of a specified name may be canceled by filing with the secretary of state notice of cancellation, executed by the applicant or transferee, specifying the name reservation to be canceled and the name and address of the applicant or transferee.
