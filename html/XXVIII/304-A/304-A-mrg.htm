<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-A:7 Rules for Determining the Existence of a Partnership. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In determining whether a partnership exists, these rules shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided by RSA 304-A:16, persons who are not partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership, whether such co-owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The sharing of gross returns does not of itself establish a partnership, whether or not the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in any property from which the returns are derived.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but no such inference shall be drawn if such profits were received in payment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As a debt by installments or otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) As wages of an employee or rent to a landlord.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) As an annuity to a widow or representative of a deceased partner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) As the consideration for the sale of a goodwill of a business or other property by installments or otherwise.

<center><h3>Section 304-A:9</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-A:9 Partner Agent of Partnership as to Partnership Business. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business, and the act of every partner, including the execution in the partnership name of any instrument, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership of which he is a member, binds the partnership unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing has knowledge of the fact that he has no such authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An act of a partner which is not apparently for the carrying on of the business of the partnership in the usual way does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the other partners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unless authorized by the other partners or unless they have abandoned the business, one or more but less than all the partners have no authority to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Assign the partnership property in trust for creditors or on the assignee's promise to pay the debts of the partnership,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Dispose of the goodwill of the business,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Do any other act which would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of a partnership,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Confess a judgment,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Submit a partnership claim or liability to arbitration or reference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No act of a partner in contravention of a restriction on authority shall bind the partnership to persons having knowledge of the restriction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-A:10 Conveyance of Real Property of the Partnership. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Where title to real property is in the partnership name, any partner may convey title to such property by a conveyance executed in the partnership name;  but the partnership may recover such property unless the partner's act binds the partnership under RSA 304-A:9, I or unless such property has been conveyed by the grantee or a person claiming through such grantee to a holder for value without knowledge that the partner, in making the conveyance, has exceeded his authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Where title to real property is in the name of the partnership, a conveyance executed by a partner, in his own name, passes the equitable interest of the partnership, provided the act is one within the authority of the partner under RSA 304-A:9, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Where title to real property is in the name of one or more but not all the partners, and the record does not disclose the right of the partnership, the partners in whose name the title stands may convey title to such property, but the partnership may recover such property if the partner's act does not bind the partnership under RSA 304-A:9, I, unless the purchaser or his assignee is a holder for value without knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Where the title to real property is in the name of one or more or all the partners, or in a third person in trust for the partnership, a conveyance executed by a partner in the partnership name, or in his own name, passes the equitable interest of the partnership, provided the act is one within the authority of the partner under RSA 304-A:9, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Where the title to real property is in the names of all the partners, a conveyance executed by all the partners passes all their rights in such property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All conveyances of real property of any partnership made prior to August 29, 1973, by the partnership in the partnership name shall be valid without further act by the partnership or any of its members.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-A:15 Nature of Partner's Liability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, all partners are liable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Jointly and severally for everything chargeable to the partnership under RSA 304-A:13 and RSA 304-A:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Jointly for all other debts and obligations of the partnership;  but any partner may enter into a separate obligation to perform a partnership contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Subject to paragraph III, a partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not liable directly or indirectly (including by way of indemnification, contribution, assessment or otherwise) for debts, obligations and liabilities of or chargeable to the partnership, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise, arising from omissions, negligence, wrongful acts, misconduct or malpractice committed while the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership and in the course of the partnership business by another partner or an employee, agent, or representative of the partnership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Paragraph II shall not affect the liability of a partner in a registered limited liability partnership for the partner's own omissions, negligence, wrongful acts, misconduct or malpractice, or that of any person under the partner's direct supervision and control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not a proper party to a proceeding by or against a registered limited liability partnership, the object of which is to recover damages or enforce the obligations arising out of the omissions, negligence, wrongful acts, misconduct or malpractice of the type described in paragraph II, unless such partner is personally liable under paragraph III.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-A:16 Partner by Estoppel. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents to another representing him to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership or with one or more persons not actual partners, he is liable to any such person to whom such representation has been made, who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, and if he has made such representation or consented to its being made in a public manner he is liable to such person, whether the representation has or has not been made or communicated to such person so giving credit by or with the knowledge of the apparent partner making the representation or consenting to its being made:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) When a partnership liability results, he is liable as though he were an actual member of the partnership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When no partnership liability results, he is liable jointly with the other persons, if any, so consenting to the contract or representation as to incur liability, otherwise separately.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a person has been thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons not actual partners, he is an agent of the persons consenting to such representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as though he were a partner in fact, with respect to persons who rely upon the representation.  Where all the members of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results;  but in all other cases it is the joint act or obligation of the person acting and the persons consenting to the representation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) By any act appropriate for winding up partnership affairs or completing transactions unfinished at dissolution;

(2) Though he had not so extended credit, had nevertheless known of the partnership prior to dissolution, and, having no knowledge or notice of dissolution, the fact of dissolution had not been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the place (or in each place if more than one) at which the partnership business was regularly carried on.

III. When any partner retires or dies and the business of the dissolved partnership is continued as set forth in paragraphs I and II of this section, with the consent of the retired partners or the representative of the deceased partner, but without any assignment of his right in partnership property, rights of creditors of the dissolved partnership and of the creditors of the person or partnership continuing the business shall be as if such assignment had been made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 304-A:56 Conversion of Partnership to Limited Partnership or Limited Liability Company. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A partnership may be converted to a limited partnership or a limited liability company pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The terms and conditions of a conversion of a partnership to a limited partnership or a limited liability company must be approved by all of the partners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. After the conversion is approved by the partners, the partnership shall file a certificate of conversion together with a certificate of limited partnership, in the case of a conversion to a limited partnership, or a certificate of formation, in the case of a conversion to a limited liability company, in the jurisdiction in which the limited partnership or the limited liability company is to be formed and in accordance with the laws applicable to such other entity.  The certificate of conversion must include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A statement that the partnership was converted to a limited partnership or a limited liability company from a partnership;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Its former name;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement that all of the partners approved the conversion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The conversion takes effect upon the effective date and time of the certificate of limited partnership or the certificate of formation of the limited liability company, as the case may be.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A general partner who becomes a limited partner of a limited partnership or a member of a limited liability company as a result of the conversion remains liable as a general partner for an obligation incurred by the partnership before the conversion takes effect.  If the other party to a transaction with the limited partnership or limited liability company reasonably believes when entering the transaction that the limited partner or member is a general partner, the limited partner or member is liable for an obligation incurred by the limited partnership or limited liability company within 90 days after the conversion takes effect.  The liability of the limited partner or member for all other obligations of the limited partnership or the limited liability company incurred after the conversion takes effect is that of a limited partner or a member, as the case may be, as provided in RSA 304-B and RSA 304-C.
