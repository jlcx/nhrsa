II. Subject to paragraph III, a partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not liable directly or indirectly (including by way of indemnification, contribution, assessment or otherwise) for debts, obligations and liabilities of or chargeable to the partnership, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise, arising from omissions, negligence, wrongful acts, misconduct or malpractice committed while the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership and in the course of the partnership business by another partner or an employee, agent, or representative of the partnership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not a proper party to a proceeding by or against a registered limited liability partnership, the object of which is to recover damages or enforce the obligations arising out of the omissions, negligence, wrongful acts, misconduct or malpractice of the type described in paragraph II, unless such partner is personally liable under paragraph III.
