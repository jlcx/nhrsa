&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A limited partnership may elect to withhold payment required by RSA 304-B:16-i from a dissenter unless the dissenter was a limited partner before the date set forth in the dissenters' notice as the date of the first announcement to news media or to limited partners of the principal terms of the proposed limited partnership action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To the extent the limited partnership elects not to withhold payment under paragraph I, after effectuating the proposed limited partnership action, it shall estimate the fair value of the limited partnership interest, plus accrued interest, and shall pay this amount to each dissenter who agrees to accept it in full satisfaction of the dissenter's demand.  The limited partnership shall send with its offer a statement of its estimate of the fair value of the limited partnership interest, an explanation of how the interest was calculated, and a statement of the dissenter's right to demand payment under RSA 304-B:16-<i>l.</i>
