<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A dissenter may notify the limited partnership in writing of the dissenter's own estimate of the fair value of such dissenter's limited partnership interest and amount of interest due, and demand payment of the dissenter's estimate (less any payment under RSA 304-B:16-i), or reject the limited partnership's offer under RSA 304-B:16-k;  and demand payment of the fair value of the limited partnership interest and interest due, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The dissenter believes that the amount paid under RSA 304-B:16-i or offered under RSA 304-B:16-k is less than the fair value of such dissenter's limited partnership interest or that the interest due is incorrectly calculated;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The limited partnership fails to make payment under RSA 304-B:16-i within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A dissenter waives the right to demand payment under this section unless the dissenter notifies the limited partnership of such dissenter's demand in writing under paragraph I within 30 days after the limited partnership made or offered payment for such dissenter's limited partnership interest.
