If the limited partnership does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The limited partnership shall commence the proceeding in superior court of the county where the limited partnership's principal executive office (or, if none in this state, its registered office) is located.  If the limited partnership is a foreign entity without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the registered office of the domestic limited partnership merged with or converted into the foreign entity was located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III.

Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under paragraph II is plenary and exclusive.  The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value.  The appraisers have the powers described in the order appointing them, or in any amendment to it.  The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter's partnership interest plus accrued interest exceeds the amount paid by the limited partnership;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the fair value, plus accrued interest, of such dissenter's after-acquired partnership interests for which the limited partnership elected to withhold payment under RSA 304-B:16-k.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The limited partnership is entitled to judgment against each specific dissenter for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of such dissenter's partnership interest, plus accrued interest, is less than the amount paid by the limited partnership to each dissenter.
