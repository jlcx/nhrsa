<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph VII and subject to paragraph VI, in the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor, a person other than the donor is barred from making, amending, or revoking an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part if the donor made an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:5 or an amendment to an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A donor's revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:6 is not a refusal and does not bar another person specified in RSA 291-A:4 or RSA 291-A:9 from making an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:5 or RSA 291-A:10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a person other than the donor makes an unrevoked anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:5 or an amendment to an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:6, another person may not make, amend, or revoke the gift of the donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A revocation of an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part under RSA 291-A:6 by a person other than the donor shall not bar another person from making an anatomical gift of the body or part under RSA 291-A:5 or RSA 291-A:10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under RSA 291-A:4, an anatomical gift of a part is neither a refusal to give another part nor a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of another part at a later time by the donor or another person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under RSA 291-A:4, an anatomical gift of a part for one or more of the purposes set forth in RSA 291-A:4 is not a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of the part for any of the other purposes by the donor or any other person under RSA 291-A:5 or RSA 291-A:10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If a donor who is an unemancipated minor dies, a parent of the donor who is reasonably available may revoke or amend an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If an unemancipated minor who signed a refusal dies, a parent of the minor who is reasonably available may revoke the minor's refusal.

II. If there is more than one member of a class listed in subparagraphs I(a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) entitled to make an anatomical gift, an anatomical gift may be made by a member of the class unless that member or a person to which the gift may pass under RSA 291-A:11 knows of an objection by another member of the class.  If an objection is known, the gift may be made only by a majority of the members of the class who are reasonably available.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An eye bank or tissue bank.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an anatomical gift to an individual under subparagraph I(b) cannot be transplanted into the individual, the part passes in accordance with paragraph VII in the absence of an express, contrary indication by the person making the anatomical gift.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If an anatomical gift of one or more specific parts or of all parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in paragraph I but identifies the purpose for which an anatomical gift may be used, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the part is an eye and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate eye bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the part is tissue and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate tissue bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If an anatomical gift of one or more specific parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in paragraph I and does not identify the purpose of the gift, the gift passes in accordance with paragraph VII and the parts must be used for transplantation or therapy if suitable and if not suitable for those purposes, may be used for research or education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a document of gift specifies only a general intent to make an anatomical gift by words such as "donor,'' "organ donor,'' or "body donor,'' or by a symbol or statement of similar import, the gift passes in accordance with paragraph VII and the parts shall be used for transplantation or therapy if suitable and if not suitable for those purposes, may be used for research or education.

IX. If an anatomical gift does not pass pursuant to paragraphs I-VIII or the decedent's body or part is not used for transplantation, therapy, research, or education, custody of the body or part passes to the person under obligation to dispose of the body or part.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A person may not accept an anatomical gift if the person knows that the gift was not effectively made under RSA 291-A:5 or RSA 291-A:10 or if the person knows that the decedent made a refusal under RSA 291-A:7 that was not revoked.  For purposes of the paragraph, if a person knows that an anatomical gift was made on a document of gift, the person is deemed to know of any amendment or revocation of the gift or any refusal to make an anatomical gift on the same document of gift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 291-A:14 Rights and Duties of Procurement Organization and Others. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the New Hampshire donor registry and any other donor registry that it knows exists for the geographical area in which the individual resides to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A procurement organization shall be allowed reasonable access to information in the records of the department of motor vehicles through the New Hampshire donor registry pursuant to RSA 291-A:20 to ascertain whether an individual at or near death is a donor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to assess the medical suitability of a part that is or could be the subject of an anatomical gift for transplantation, therapy, research, or education from a donor or a prospective donor.  During the examination period, measures necessary to maintain the potential medical suitability of the part may not be withdrawn unless the hospital or procurement organization knows that the individual expressed a contrary intent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless prohibited by law other than this chapter, at any time after a donor's death, the person to which a part passes under RSA 291-A:11 may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to assess the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Unless prohibited by law other than this chapter, an examination under paragraphs III or IV may include an examination of all medical and dental records of the donor or prospective donor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon the death of a minor who was a donor or had signed a refusal, unless a procurement organization knows the minor is emancipated, the procurement organization shall conduct a reasonable search for the parents of the minor and provide the parents with an opportunity to revoke or amend the anatomical gift or revoke the refusal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Upon referral by a hospital under paragraph I, a procurement organization shall make a reasonable search for any person listed in RSA 291-A:9 having priority to make an anatomical gift on behalf of a prospective donor.  If a procurement organization receives information that an anatomical gift to any other person was made, amended, or revoked, it shall promptly advise the other person of all relevant information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Subject to RSA 291-A:11 and RSA 291-A:22, the rights of the person to which a part passes under RSA 291-A:11 are superior to the rights of all others with respect to the part.  The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part.  Subject to the terms of the document of gift and this act, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial or cremation, and use of remains in a funeral service.  If the gift is of a part, the person to which the part passes under RSA 291-A:11, upon the death of the donor and before embalming, burial, or cremation, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Neither the physician who attends the decedent at death nor the physician who determines the time of the decedent's death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part from the decedent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of a donor that the physician or technician is qualified to remove.

II. If a medical examiner receives notice from a procurement organization that an anatomical gift might be available or was made with respect to a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner and a post-mortem examination is going to be performed, unless the medical examiner denies recovery in accordance with RSA 291-A:22, the medical examiner or designee shall conduct a post-mortem examination of the body or the part in a manner and within a period compatible with its preservation for the purposes of the gift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 291-A:22 Facilitation of Anatomical Gift From Decedent Whose Body is Under Jurisdiction of Medical Examiner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon request of a procurement organization, a medical examiner shall release to the procurement organization the name, contact information, and available medical and social history of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner.  If the decedent's body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research, or education, the medical examiner shall release post-mortem examination results to the procurement organization.  The procurement organization may make a subsequent disclosure of the post-mortem examination results or other information received from the medical examiner only if relevant to transplantation or therapy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The medical examiner may conduct a medicolegal examination by reviewing all medical records, laboratory test results, x-rays, other diagnostic results, and other information that any person possesses about a donor or prospective donor whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner which the medical examiner determines may be relevant to the investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person that has any information requested by a medical examiner pursuant to paragraph II shall provide that information as expeditiously as possible to allow the medical examiner to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a period compatible with the preservation of parts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If an anatomical gift has been or might be made of a part of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner and a post-mortem examination shall not be required, or the medical examiner determines that a post-mortem examination is required but that the recovery of the part that is the subject of an anatomical gift will not interfere with the examination, the medical examiner and procurement organization shall cooperate in the timely removal of the part from the decedent for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner has been or might be made, but the medical examiner initially believes that the recovery of the part could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the decedent's cause or manner of death, the medical examiner shall consult with the procurement organization or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization about the proposed recovery.  After consultation, the medical examiner may allow the recovery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Following the consultation under paragraph V, in the absence of mutually agreed-upon protocols to resolve conflict between the medical examiner and the procurement organization, if the medical examiner intends to deny recovery, the medical examiner or designee, at the request of the procurement organization, shall attend the removal procedure for the part before making a final determination not to allow the procurement organization to recover the part.  During the removal procedure, the medical examiner or designee may allow recovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the medical examiner or designee reasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent's cause or manner of death, deny recovery by the procurement organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the medical examiner or designee denies recovery under paragraph VI, the medical examiner or designee shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Explain in a record the specific reasons for not allowing recovery of the part;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Include the specific reasons in the records of the medical examiner;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide a record with the specific reasons to the procurement organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If the medical examiner or designee allows recovery of a part under paragraph IV, V, or VI, the procurement organization, upon request, shall cause the physician or technician who removes the part to provide the medical examiner with a record describing the condition of the part, a biopsy, a photograph, and any other information and observations that would assist in the post-mortem examination.
