Upon request of a procurement organization, a medical examiner shall release to the procurement organization the name, contact information, and available medical and social history of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner.  If the decedent's body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research, or education, the medical examiner shall release post-mortem examination results to the procurement organization.  The procurement organization may make a subsequent disclosure of the post-mortem examination results or other information received from the medical examiner only if relevant to transplantation or therapy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The medical examiner may conduct a medicolegal examination by reviewing all medical records, laboratory test results, x-rays, other diagnostic results, and other information that any person possesses about a donor or prospective donor whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner which the medical examiner determines may be relevant to the investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person that has any information requested by a medical examiner pursuant to paragraph II shall provide that information as expeditiously as possible to allow the medical examiner to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a period compatible with the preservation of parts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If an anatomical gift has been or might be made of a part of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner and a post-mortem examination shall not be required, or the medical examiner determines that a post-mortem examination is required but that the recovery of the part that is the subject of an anatomical gift will not interfere with the examination, the medical examiner and procurement organization shall cooperate in the timely removal of the part from the decedent for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner has been or might be made, but the medical examiner initially believes that the recovery of the part could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the decedent's cause or manner of death, the medical examiner shall consult with the procurement organization or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization about the proposed recovery.  After consultation, the medical examiner may allow the recovery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Following the consultation under paragraph V, in the absence of mutually agreed-upon protocols to resolve conflict between the medical examiner and the procurement organization, if the medical examiner intends to deny recovery, the medical examiner or designee, at the request of the procurement organization, shall attend the removal procedure for the part before making a final determination not to allow the procurement organization to recover the part.  During the removal procedure, the medical examiner or designee may allow recovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the medical examiner or designee reasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent's cause or manner of death, deny recovery by the procurement organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the medical examiner or designee denies recovery under paragraph VI, the medical examiner or designee shall:
