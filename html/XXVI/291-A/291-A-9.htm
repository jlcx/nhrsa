<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An agent of the decedent at the time of death who could have made an anatomical gift under RSA 291-A:4, II immediately before the decedent's death;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The spouse of the decedent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Adult children of the decedent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Parents of the decedent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Adult siblings of the decedent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Adult grandchildren of the decedent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Grandparents of the decedent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) An adult who exhibited special care and concern for the decedent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The persons who were acting as the guardians of the person of the decedent at the time of death;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Any other person having the authority to dispose of the decedent's body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If there is more than one member of a class listed in subparagraphs I(a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) entitled to make an anatomical gift, an anatomical gift may be made by a member of the class unless that member or a person to which the gift may pass under RSA 291-A:11 knows of an objection by another member of the class.  If an objection is known, the gift may be made only by a majority of the members of the class who are reasonably available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person may not make an anatomical gift if, at the time of the decedent's death, a person in a prior class under paragraph I is reasonably available to make or to object to the making of an anatomical gift.
