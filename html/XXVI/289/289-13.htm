<codesect>
Any cemetery laid out by an individual or corporation and located within the municipality, in which all lots have been sold and for the care of which trust funds are held by the municipality, may be deeded to the municipality with no implied financial liability to the municipality for the maintenance of the cemetery over and above the trust fund income, provided the municipality votes to accept such cemetery transfer.  Municipalities may raise and appropriate additional funds for the care of such cemeteries.  Upon the transfer of the title to the cemetery, the municipal cemetery trustees shall have the sole management responsibility for the cemetery.
