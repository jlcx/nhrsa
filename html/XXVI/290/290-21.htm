&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 290:21 Effect of Payment by Others. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Except to the degree it must be considered by the court under RSA 290:19, IV, the fact that a person other than the subject has paid or agreed to pay for all or part of arrangements does not give that person a greater right to custody and control than that person would otherwise have.
