<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) A game operator employer conducting games of chance at a facility that is required to be licensed pursuant to RSA 287-D:7 shall conduct and record, at the expense of the game operator employer, video surveillance that allows clear, unobstructed views of cashier transactions, table games where cash wagers are accepted, and the counting of money from storage boxes removed from a gaming table.  A game operator employer shall be exempt from this provision if the games of chance are conducted in a temporary location for 4 days or fewer, provided that an alternative method of surveillance is approved by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Surveillance shall include the customer, the employee, and the surrounding area and shall monitor and record with sufficient clarity to identify employees and customers in all areas where currency is counted, verified, sorted, stacked, or stored, including monitoring and recording all table game drop boxes, safes, and counting surfaces, and all cashier personnel.  The counting surface area shall be continuously monitored and recorded by a dedicated camera during the count.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Access to the surveillance equipment shall be limited to management personnel, designated employees, state regulators, and other persons authorized in accordance with the surveillance policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The game operator employer shall ensure at least one person at the facility while games of chance are being conducted is trained in the use of the equipment, knowledge of the games, and all applicable regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Each camera required by these regulations shall be installed in a manner that will prevent it from being readily obstructed, tampered with, or disabled by customers or employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Reasonable effort shall be made to repair each malfunction of surveillance system equipment required by the standards in this section within 72 hours after the malfunction is discovered, provided any such malfunction shall be reported to the commission immediately.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) In the event of a dedicated camera malfunction, the game operator employer or the surveillance person shall immediately provide alternative camera coverage or other security measures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The surveillance system, at a minimum, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Have an auxiliary or backup power source available and capable of providing immediate restoration of power to all elements of the surveillance system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Include date and time generators that possess the capability to display the date and time of recorded events on all digital recordings.  The displayed date and time shall not significantly obstruct the recorded view.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Utilize cameras that possess the capability of having a picture displayed on a monitor and recorded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Include sufficient numbers of monitors and recorders to simultaneously display and record multiple table games and count room activities, and record the views of all dedicated cameras and motion-activated cameras.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Record at 30 frames per second or its equivalent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) All digital records of coverage provided by cameras required by this section shall be retained for a minimum of 45 days except as otherwise provided in this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Recordings involving suspected or confirmed gaming crimes, unlawful activity, or actions of investigations by management personnel shall be retained indefinitely until released by the commission and a copy of any report and video shall be forwarded to the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Duly authenticated copies of digital records shall be provided to the commission upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Multiple recordings shall be made to avoid any loss of images in the event of a hardware failure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A recording library log, or comparable alternative procedure approved by the commission, shall be maintained to demonstrate compliance with the storage, identification, and retention standards required in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) All recordings not otherwise required to be retained may be destroyed after a period of 45 days, unless the commission provides written notice to retain certain video recordings.
