&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 287-D:10 Secondary Game Operator License Application;  Specific Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Other than members of a charitable organization, any person who is employed by a game operator employer or a primary game operator shall be licensed under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition to the general requirements under RSA 287-D:5, a secondary game operator license application shall include, at a minimum, the following information provided that the lottery commission may, by rule, establish additional items to be submitted on the application form or attached to it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A list of any other states in which the game operator has been registered or licensed as a professional fundraiser, professional game operator, or other similar position.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement of whether a registration or license listed in subparagraph (a) has been denied, suspended, revoked, or enjoined by a court or state agency, or if such proceedings are pending.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The identity of the primary game operators for whom the applicant works.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Two passport quality photographs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A secondary game operator license shall expire on the last day of the month of the licensee's birthday.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The provisions of RSA 7:28-c shall not apply to secondary game operator licensees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this section shall prevent a licensee from working for different licensed entities.  A licensee who works for more than one game operator employer during the licensed period shall submit a supplemental application with a separate licensing fee, have a separate badge for each game operator employer, and pay a separate fee for each badge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon receipt of a completed application under this section, and at the request of the applicant, the lottery commission may issue a provisional license, valid for up to 60 days, under rules adopted by the lottery commission under RSA 541-A.  If the lottery commission denies the license, the provisional license shall expire upon the applicant's receipt of such denial.  If the applicant requests a provisional license under this paragraph, he or she shall submit a fee of $10 to the lottery commission, in addition to the application fee for the license, at the time of such request.
