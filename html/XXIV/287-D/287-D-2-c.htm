<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whether a registration or license listed in subparagraph (d) has been denied, suspended, revoked, or enjoined by a court or state agency, or if such proceedings are pending;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The names and addresses of any individuals with whom the applicant is affiliated in the fundraising or game operating business;  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The name of the financial institution with at least one branch in New Hampshire and the corresponding bank account number for the account in which money from the game of chance will be deposited and withdrawn.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No person shall be permitted to participate in the operation of a game of chance as a game operator, unless that person:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Prior to conducting any games of chance, the game operator or the game operator employer shall submit a bond for each location where the game operator is conducting games of chance, conditioned upon the game operator running games of chance in conformity with this chapter and with the rules and regulations prescribed by the racing and charitable gaming commission, in the amount of up to $500,000 but not less than $25,000 to the racing and charitable gaming commission with the application form.

VI. To be eligible for licensure under this chapter, a licensed game operator employer or primary game operator shall maintain an account at a financial institution with at least one branch in New Hampshire solely in the name of the licensed game operator in which the money only from games of chance shall be deposited and withdrawn.  All payments to charities, all prizes over $500, and all other expenses associated with games of chance shall be paid by check from said account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In addition to the charitable organization, game operators who operate games of chance on behalf of a charitable organization shall also be held responsible for all requirements that the charitable organization is responsible for when they operate the games of chance themselves.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Unless a provision to the contrary is part of a written agreement in place prior to the commencement of a game date between the charitable organization and the game operator or game operator employer, all moneys due to the charitable organization shall be paid over to the organization no later than 5 business days following the date on which a game was conducted.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any agreement with the charitable organization, the game operator or game operator employer shall pay over all moneys due to the charitable organization no later than 15 business days following a game date.
