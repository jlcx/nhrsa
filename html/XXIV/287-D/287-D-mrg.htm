<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All devices and equipment used to conduct said games of chance shall be subject to inspection by duly authorized law enforcement or pari-mutuel officials.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

V. No single wager by a player, on any game of chance, shall exceed the amount of $4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any contract for the rental of a facility for a game of chance shall be independent of any contract for the rental of equipment.  Those contracts shall not be contingent upon the charitable organization's agreement that it will contract with a particular business for a particular facility or equipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Unless a charitable organization rents a facility from a game operator employer or a primary game operator licensed under RSA 287-D:2-c, the charitable organization shall only rent a facility by means of a fixed rental payment.  The fixed rental payment shall not be based on a percentage of what the charitable organization receives from the game of chance and it shall reflect fair rental value of the property for any use not just as a place to hold a game of chance.  If a charitable organization rents a facility from a licensed game operator under RSA 287-D:2-c, the charitable organization shall retain no less than 35 percent of the gross revenues from any games of chance minus any prizes paid in accordance with RSA 287-D:3, VIII.  Any rental agreement entered into by the charitable organization shall be submitted with the charitable organization's license application for review by the racing and charitable gaming commission.  Under no circumstances shall a charitable organization sustain any loss from games of chance, such that its share of the gross revenues minus any prizes paid is less than zero dollars, during a license period with a single game operator.  All contracts between a game operator employer and a charitable organization to conduct games of chance under this chapter shall contain the following language:  "This agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties hereto.  No charge or fee of any kind that is not contained in this agreement shall be paid by the charity.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The charitable organization shall retain no less than 35 percent of the gross revenues from any game of chance minus any prizes paid on any game date in which game operators licensed under RSA 287-D:2-c are involved in any capacity.  Such revenues shall be used by the organization to advance its charitable purpose.  No fee for any service which is required by or provided by the game operator employer or primary game operator shall be allowed unless such fee is agreed to in writing and disclosed to the commission as part of the agreement between the game operator employer or primary game operator and the charity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In games where chips have no monetary value, 3 percent of all funds collected from players, less moneys used by the racing and charitable gaming commission to fund authorized personnel expenses and related costs, shall be paid to the state treasurer to be deposited into the general fund.  Such payments shall be made within 5 business days of the game date on which the funds were collected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. In games where chips have monetary value, 10 percent of the rake or house winnings and other moneys collected by the game operator that are not paid out as prizes to players, less moneys used by the racing and charitable gaming commission to fund authorized personnel expenses and related costs, shall be paid to the state treasurer for deposit into the general fund.  Such payments shall be made within 5 business days of the game date on which the funds were collected.
