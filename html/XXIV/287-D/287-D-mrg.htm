<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name, residence address, and nature of the ownership interest including, where applicable, the number of shares of stock held and if known, how obtained, of every person who possesses an ownership interest in such entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(c) Such information as the attorney general may prescribe by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Each licensee shall notify the attorney general and the commission of any change of information required by this paragraph within 10 days of such change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The commission shall refer all applications to the attorney general who shall conduct a background investigation of the license applicant or holder, any person included in paragraph I, or any person or entity upon whom the license applicant or holder relies for financial support.  Any appropriate state or federal law enforcement system may investigate the subject's financial, criminal, or business background, or any other information which the attorney general, in the attorney general's sole discretion, may find to bear on the subject's fitness to be associated with charitable gaming in New Hampshire, including, but not limited to, the subject's character, personal associations, and the extent to which the subject is properly doing business in the manner in which it purports to operate.  When the commission requests such an investigation, the attorney general shall report the results of such investigation to the commission within 90 days after the receipt of the request.  Notwithstanding RSA 91-A, the results of any such investigation shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure or to public inspection, except that the attorney general shall have sole discretion to determine the extent to which and the manner in which the results may be reported to the commission or other state agency or official and, if reported, whether such results are to retain their confidential character;  provided, however, that whenever the attorney general conducts such an investigation, the attorney general shall notify the commission whether or not in the attorney general's opinion such person is fit to be associated with charitable gaming in New Hampshire.  No person shall be issued or hold a license if in the opinion of the attorney general such person is not fit to be associated with charitable gaming in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The attorney general may conduct a background investigation described in subparagraph (a) on the attorney general's motion.

In any investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph III, the attorney general may require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production of such correspondence, documents, books, and papers as the attorney general deems advisable, and for purposes of this section, may administer oaths and take the testimony of witnesses.  No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any book or paper in any investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph III upon the ground that such testimony or documentary evidence might tend to incriminate such person;  provided that if, after a claim of privilege, the attorney general, in writing, orders such person to testify or produce documentary evidence, that person shall not be prosecuted, punished, or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any act, transaction, matter, or thing which such person, under oath, disclosed or produced.  No person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by such person in such testimony.

<center><h2>Unlawful Gambling Machines</h2></center>

<center><h3>Section 287-D:26</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 287-D:26 Purpose.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds use of gambling machines is pervasive statewide with little or no oversight by the state.  The general court also finds that redemption slot machines are frequently a front for unlawful gambling, and the use of such machines siphons money away from legal, charitable gambling to the detriment of the state's charities.  Therefore the general court is establishing an administrative investigation and enforcement ability in addition to existing criminal prosecution.
