&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 287-D:26 Purpose.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds use of gambling machines is pervasive statewide with little or no oversight by the state.  The general court also finds that redemption slot machines are frequently a front for unlawful gambling, and the use of such machines siphons money away from legal, charitable gambling to the detriment of the state's charities.  Therefore the general court is establishing an administrative investigation and enforcement ability in addition to existing criminal prosecution.
