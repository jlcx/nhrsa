I. The state treasurer shall credit all moneys received from the lottery commission under RSA 284, RSA 287-D, and RSA 287-E, and interest received on such moneys, to a special fund from which the treasurer shall pay all expenses of the commission incident to the administration of this subdivision and all administration and enforcement expenses of racing and charitable gaming under RSA 284, RSA 287-D, and RSA 287-E.  Any balance left in such fund after such expenses are paid shall be deposited in the education trust fund established under RSA 198:39.
