I. Any person, association, corporation, or any other type of entity applying for or holding a license issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall file annually, not later than December 31, with the attorney general a complete and detailed written statement, signed under oath, by the applicant or holder of such license, if an individual, or by the officers of the applicant or holder, if a corporation or an association, containing the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name, residence address, and nature of the ownership interest, including where applicable the number of shares of stock held and, if known, how obtained, of every person who possesses an ownership interest in such license applicant or holder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The name, address, present principal occupation or employment, and the name and principal business of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is carried on of every director, officer, and holder of 10 percent or more ownership interest in such license applicant or holder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The name and all information which a license applicant or holder has or might reasonably be expected to have as to any felony convictions of any officer, director, or holder of an ownership interest of any degree;  provided, that if the license applicant or holder is an association or corporation in which 25 or fewer individuals or organizations hold an ownership interest or stock, then the information required by subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall be provided by each such interest holder or stockholder, who shall be further required to submit a detailed statement of assets and liabilities on forms prescribed by the attorney general;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Such information as the commissioner may prescribe by rule or rejection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The attorney general shall have the authority to conduct an investigation on the attorney general's motion into the background of the license applicant or holder, of any person included in paragraph I or of any person or entity upon whom the license applicant or holder relies for financial support.  In addition, whenever the lottery commission shall receive an application, it shall refer the application to the attorney general who shall conduct such an investigation.  The investigation may be conducted through any appropriate state or federal law enforcement system and may seek information as to the subject's financial, criminal or business background, or any other information which the attorney general, in the attorney general's sole discretion, may find to bear on the subject's fitness to be associated with racing in New Hampshire, including, but not limited to, the subject's character, personal associations, and the extent to which the subject is properly doing business in the manner in which it purports to operate.  When the lottery commission requests such an investigation, the attorney general shall report the results of such investigation to the lottery commission within 90 days after the receipt of the request.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the results of any such investigation shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure or to public inspection, except that the attorney general shall have sole discretion to determine the extent to which and the manner in which the results may be reported to the lottery commission or other state agency or official and, if reported, whether such results are to retain their confidential character;  provided, however, that whenever the attorney general conducts such an investigation, the attorney general shall notify the lottery commission whether or not in the attorney general's opinion such person is fit to be associated with racing in New Hampshire.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be issued or hold a license if in the opinion of the attorney general such person is not fit to be associated with racing in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The expenses of the lottery commission and the office of attorney general in conducting any investigation authorized in this section, including the services of consultants, experts, accountants, and other assistants, shall be a direct charge against the applicant or holder.  Total expenses under this paragraph shall not exceed $50,000, except with the approval of the fiscal committee of the general court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In any investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph II, the attorney general or any duly authorized justice department staff member may require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production of such correspondence, documents, books, and papers as the attorney general or staff member deems advisable, and for purposes of this section, may administer oaths and take the testimony of witnesses.  No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any book or paper in any investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph II upon the ground that such testimony or documentary evidence might tend to incriminate such person;  provided that if, after a claim of privilege, the attorney general, in writing, orders such person to testify or produce documentary evidence, that person shall not be prosecuted, punished, or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any act, transaction, matter, or thing which such person, under oath, disclosed or produced.  No person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by such person in such testimony.
