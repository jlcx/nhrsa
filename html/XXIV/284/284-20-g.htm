&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 284:20-g Contracting and Payment for Laboratory Testing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Beginning April 1, 2008, the commission shall contract with a qualified laboratory to provide laboratory testing services for the commission on horses that perform live at racetracks authorized to conduct live racing in the state.  The commission shall issue a request for proposals for such services that sets forth the terms and conditions of the proposed service contract, including the requirements of this section, laboratory qualifications, cost per test, and such other information determined to be relevant by the commission.  The commission shall present the contract to the attorney general for review and, upon approval by the attorney general, the proposal shall be submitted to the governor and council for approval.  The contract shall expire no later than June 30 of the second year of a biennium.  Such laboratory test service agreement shall provide that the laboratory shall send each licensee an invoice for such testing in accordance with paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The total cost of any contract under this section shall not exceed $300,000 annually.  In the event that the aggregate cost of testing exceeds $300,000 based solely upon an increase in live racing within the state, the commission may request an increase in the maximum contract amount from the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each licensee shall pay the laboratory for the cost of each laboratory test conducted pursuant to the laboratory test service contract on the horse that performed live at the licensee's track.  The laboratory shall provide the licensee with an invoice for such costs within 10 days after the end of each month in which the licensee conducts live racing and the licensee shall pay the invoice within 30 days after receipt of that invoice.  Each invoice shall specify the number of tests conducted during the prior month, the identity of the animal tested, the results of each test, and the cost of each test.
