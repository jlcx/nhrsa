(c) The name and all information which a license applicant or holder has or might reasonably be expected to have as to any felony convictions of any officer, director, or holder of an ownership interest of any degree;  provided, that if the license applicant or holder is an association or corporation in which 25 or fewer individuals or organizations hold an ownership interest or stock, then the information required by subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall be provided by each such interest holder or stockholder, who shall be further required to submit a detailed statement of assets and liabilities on forms prescribed by the attorney general;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Such information as the commissioner may prescribe by rule or rejection.

II. The attorney general shall have the authority to conduct an investigation on the attorney general's motion into the background of the license applicant or holder, of any person included in paragraph I or of any person or entity upon whom the license applicant or holder relies for financial support.  In addition, whenever the lottery commission shall receive an application, it shall refer the application to the attorney general who shall conduct such an investigation.  The investigation may be conducted through any appropriate state or federal law enforcement system and may seek information as to the subject's financial, criminal or business background, or any other information which the attorney general, in the attorney general's sole discretion, may find to bear on the subject's fitness to be associated with racing in New Hampshire, including, but not limited to, the subject's character, personal associations, and the extent to which the subject is properly doing business in the manner in which it purports to operate.  When the lottery commission requests such an investigation, the attorney general shall report the results of such investigation to the lottery commission within 90 days after the receipt of the request.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the results of any such investigation shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure or to public inspection, except that the attorney general shall have sole discretion to determine the extent to which and the manner in which the results may be reported to the lottery commission or other state agency or official and, if reported, whether such results are to retain their confidential character;  provided, however, that whenever the attorney general conducts such an investigation, the attorney general shall notify the lottery commission whether or not in the attorney general's opinion such person is fit to be associated with racing in New Hampshire.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be issued or hold a license if in the opinion of the attorney general such person is not fit to be associated with racing in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The expenses of the lottery commission and the office of attorney general in conducting any investigation authorized in this section, including the services of consultants, experts, accountants, and other assistants, shall be a direct charge against the applicant or holder.  Total expenses under this paragraph shall not exceed $50,000, except with the approval of the fiscal committee of the general court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In any investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph II, the attorney general or any duly authorized justice department staff member may require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production of such correspondence, documents, books, and papers as the attorney general or staff member deems advisable, and for purposes of this section, may administer oaths and take the testimony of witnesses.  No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any book or paper in any investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph II upon the ground that such testimony or documentary evidence might tend to incriminate such person;  provided that if, after a claim of privilege, the attorney general, in writing, orders such person to testify or produce documentary evidence, that person shall not be prosecuted, punished, or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any act, transaction, matter, or thing which such person, under oath, disclosed or produced.  No person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by such person in such testimony.

(a) "State'' means each state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any territory or possession of the United States.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Simulcast'' means a licensee's receipt of the transmission of races conducted at a racetrack other than the licensee's racetrack and which races are exhibited simultaneously at the licensee's racetrack by television or other means of electronic reproduction with the conduct of such races at the point of origin and on which races the licensee sells pari-mutuel pools.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Licensee'' means
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or other entity which holds a license under RSA 284 to conduct a live running or harness horse race meet, or if the election is made pursuant to RSA 284:22-a, II(c), licensee means the individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or entity which applies for a license under RSA 284 to conduct simulcasting at a facility at which live running or harness horse racing was conducted in 2008, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or other entity which applies for a license pursuant to RSA 284:15-a to conduct simulcasting at a facility at which live dog racing was conducted in 2008 and at which facility a license was issued to an applicant for 2010 to simulcast running and harness horse racing and dog racing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) During the calendar years 1941-2029, a licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools on races held at racetracks other than at the facility of the licensee, if any, provided:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Such sales are within the enclosure of the facility at which the licensee holds a license;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Wagers are made on races which are exhibited by television or other electronic reproduction at licensee's facility simultaneously with the conduct of each such race at its point of origin with the agreement or approval of the racetrack which provides the transmission of the races to be simulcast and the racetrack which conducts the races to be simulcast;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Unless the licensee makes the election pursuant to RSA 284:22-a, II(c), the licensee which holds a license to conduct live harness or running horse racing has scheduled at least 50 calendar days of live harness and/or running horse racing in the calendar year such licensee simulcasts;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The licensee obtains the consents and approvals set forth in RSA 284:22-a, III.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph II(a), an individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or entity may be issued a license to conduct simulcasting without conducting live racing provided such person or entity makes such election with the approval of the commission and such person or entity either held a license on January 1, 2009 under this chapter to conduct a race meet or seeks to conduct simulcasting without conducting live racing at a facility at which live racing was authorized to be conducted in 2009.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Notwithstanding subparagraph II(a), an individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or entity may be issued a license to conduct simulcasting without conducting live horse racing at a location in Cheshire county, provided such person or entity applies for, and is issued, a license to conduct live horse racing at such location in Cheshire county, complies with other provisions of this chapter with regard to application and issuance of such license, makes such election with the approval of the commission, and such person or entity has submitted an economic development plan to the commission to conduct a live horse racing meet in Cheshire county within 36 months of the granting of a license.  If no live horse racing is conducted within the 36-month period the license to receive simulcast wagers shall be revoked.  The commission shall adopt regulations regarding the criteria of the proposed economic development plan prior to issuance of any approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools on races held at other appropriately licensed racetracks, whether such racetracks are in the state of New Hampshire or outside the state of New Hampshire with the agreement or approval of the racetrack which provides the transmission of the races to be simulcast and the racetrack which conducts the races to be simulcast.  A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools under RSA 284:22-a on the same types of races that it conducts live at its racetrack with the approval of the commission.  A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools under RSA 284:22-a on types of races different from the types of races conducted live at the licensee's racetrack, or if such licensee holds a license pursuant to RSA 284:15-a and RSA 284:16-a, or the licensee makes the election pursuant to RSA 284:22-a, II(c) with respect to live running or harness horse racing, provided such licensee obtains the approval from the commission and the municipality in which the licensee operates its facility had approved the issuance of a license to conduct harness or running horse racing and/or dog racing, whether live or simulcast, in such municipality either prior to enactment of RSA 284:22-a or subsequent to enactment of RSA 284:22-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A licensee which has scheduled less than 50 calendar days of live racing in a calendar year may simulcast on a day on which live racing is scheduled at the licensee's race track, without conducting live racing, provided that the live racing program is cancelled due to weather or other conditions which produce unsafe conditions at the racetrack of the licensee.  The determination to cancel a live program based upon weather or the condition of the racetrack shall be made by the licensee, and notice shall be provided to the commission.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a licensee which has scheduled less than 50 calendar days of live racing shall be limited to no more than 10 such cancellations in a calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools for simulcast races for races held at racetracks within or outside the state of New Hampshire in accordance with RSA 284:22-a, II, within the enclosure of said licensee's racetrack or a licensee, with the written agreement with the licensee which conducts or transmits the race which is to be simulcast, may sell a common pari-mutuel pool in conjunction with the licensee which conducts or transmits the race which is to be simulcast.  In the event of common pools, the licensee which conducts or transmits the race shall pay the tax required under RSA 284:23 for the portion of the common pool actually contributed at said licensee's racetrack and the licensee which simulcasts shall pay the tax due under RSA 284:23 for the portion of the common pool actually contributed at said licensee's racetrack.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools for simulcast races for races held at racetracks outside the state of New Hampshire in accordance with RSA 284:22-a, II, within the enclosure of said licensee's racetrack or said licensee, with the written agreement with the entity which conducts the race which is to be simulcast, may sell a common pari-mutuel pool in conjunction with the entity which conducts the race which is to be simulcast.  In the event of such common pools, the commission shall be in the amount established by the law of the state in which the race to be simulcast is actually conducted, provided, however, the licensee shall pay the tax as provided under RSA 284:23.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Racing officials, as defined in the rules adopted by the commission, any employee or owner of the entity which provides the totalizator system to the licensee, and any person responsible for the operation of the electronic reproduction equipment which receives the simulcast shall be prohibited from participating in wagering, directly or indirectly, on simulcast races shown at the licensee's racetrack.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The provisions of RSA 284:15-c, RSA 284:16-a, RSA 284:16-c, RSA 284:17, RSA 284:17-a, and RSA 284:17-c shall not apply to simulcast and pari-mutuel pools under RSA 284:22-a, except as specifically provided in RSA 284:22-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. RSA 284:22, I, II, III, and IV shall apply according to the type of race on which the simulcast wagers are made, excepting, however, interstate common pools as provided in RSA 284:22-a, V(b) and that the provisions made for purses made in RSA 284:22, I shall not apply to simulcast races.
