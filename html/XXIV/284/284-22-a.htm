I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "State'' means each state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any territory or possession of the United States.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Simulcast'' means a licensee's receipt of the transmission of races conducted at a racetrack other than the licensee's racetrack and which races are exhibited simultaneously at the licensee's racetrack by television or other means of electronic reproduction with the conduct of such races at the point of origin and on which races the licensee sells pari-mutuel pools.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Licensee'' means
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or other entity which holds a license under RSA 284 to conduct a live running or harness horse race meet, or if the election is made pursuant to RSA 284:22-a, II(c), licensee means the individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or entity which applies for a license under RSA 284 to conduct simulcasting at a facility at which live running or harness horse racing was conducted in 2008, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or other entity which applies for a license pursuant to RSA 284:15-a to conduct simulcasting at a facility at which live dog racing was conducted in 2008 and at which facility a license was issued to an applicant for 2010 to simulcast running and harness horse racing and dog racing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) During the calendar years 1941-2029, a licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools on races held at racetracks other than at the facility of the licensee, if any, provided:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Such sales are within the enclosure of the facility at which the licensee holds a license;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Wagers are made on races which are exhibited by television or other electronic reproduction at licensee's facility simultaneously with the conduct of each such race at its point of origin with the agreement or approval of the racetrack which provides the transmission of the races to be simulcast and the racetrack which conducts the races to be simulcast;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Unless the licensee makes the election pursuant to RSA 284:22-a, II(c), the licensee which holds a license to conduct live harness or running horse racing has scheduled at least 50 calendar days of live harness and/or running horse racing in the calendar year such licensee simulcasts;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The licensee obtains the consents and approvals set forth in RSA 284:22-a, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph II(a), an individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or entity may be issued a license to conduct simulcasting without conducting live racing provided such person or entity makes such election with the approval of the commission and such person or entity either held a license on January 1, 2009 under this chapter to conduct a race meet or seeks to conduct simulcasting without conducting live racing at a facility at which live racing was authorized to be conducted in 2009.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Notwithstanding subparagraph II(a), an individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization or entity may be issued a license to conduct simulcasting without conducting live horse racing at a location in Cheshire county, provided such person or entity applies for, and is issued, a license to conduct live horse racing at such location in Cheshire county, complies with other provisions of this chapter with regard to application and issuance of such license, makes such election with the approval of the commission, and such person or entity has submitted an economic development plan to the commission to conduct a live horse racing meet in Cheshire county within 36 months of the granting of a license.  If no live horse racing is conducted within the 36-month period the license to receive simulcast wagers shall be revoked.  The commission shall adopt regulations regarding the criteria of the proposed economic development plan prior to issuance of any approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools on races held at other appropriately licensed racetracks, whether such racetracks are in the state of New Hampshire or outside the state of New Hampshire with the agreement or approval of the racetrack which provides the transmission of the races to be simulcast and the racetrack which conducts the races to be simulcast.  A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools under RSA 284:22-a on the same types of races that it conducts live at its racetrack with the approval of the commission.  A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools under RSA 284:22-a on types of races different from the types of races conducted live at the licensee's racetrack, or if such licensee holds a license pursuant to RSA 284:15-a and RSA 284:16-a, or the licensee makes the election pursuant to RSA 284:22-a, II(c) with respect to live running or harness horse racing, provided such licensee obtains the approval from the commission and the municipality in which the licensee operates its facility had approved the issuance of a license to conduct harness or running horse racing and/or dog racing, whether live or simulcast, in such municipality either prior to enactment of RSA 284:22-a or subsequent to enactment of RSA 284:22-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A licensee which has scheduled less than 50 calendar days of live racing in a calendar year may simulcast on a day on which live racing is scheduled at the licensee's race track, without conducting live racing, provided that the live racing program is cancelled due to weather or other conditions which produce unsafe conditions at the racetrack of the licensee.  The determination to cancel a live program based upon weather or the condition of the racetrack shall be made by the licensee, and notice shall be provided to the commission.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a licensee which has scheduled less than 50 calendar days of live racing shall be limited to no more than 10 such cancellations in a calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools for simulcast races for races held at racetracks within or outside the state of New Hampshire in accordance with RSA 284:22-a, II, within the enclosure of said licensee's racetrack or a licensee, with the written agreement with the licensee which conducts or transmits the race which is to be simulcast, may sell a common pari-mutuel pool in conjunction with the licensee which conducts or transmits the race which is to be simulcast.  In the event of common pools, the licensee which conducts or transmits the race shall pay the tax required under RSA 284:23 for the portion of the common pool actually contributed at said licensee's racetrack and the licensee which simulcasts shall pay the tax due under RSA 284:23 for the portion of the common pool actually contributed at said licensee's racetrack.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A licensee may sell pari-mutuel pools for simulcast races for races held at racetracks outside the state of New Hampshire in accordance with RSA 284:22-a, II, within the enclosure of said licensee's racetrack or said licensee, with the written agreement with the entity which conducts the race which is to be simulcast, may sell a common pari-mutuel pool in conjunction with the entity which conducts the race which is to be simulcast.  In the event of such common pools, the commission shall be in the amount established by the law of the state in which the race to be simulcast is actually conducted, provided, however, the licensee shall pay the tax as provided under RSA 284:23.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Racing officials, as defined in the rules adopted by the commission, any employee or owner of the entity which provides the totalizator system to the licensee, and any person responsible for the operation of the electronic reproduction equipment which receives the simulcast shall be prohibited from participating in wagering, directly or indirectly, on simulcast races shown at the licensee's racetrack.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The provisions of RSA 284:15-c, RSA 284:16-a, RSA 284:16-c, RSA 284:17, RSA 284:17-a, and RSA 284:17-c shall not apply to simulcast and pari-mutuel pools under RSA 284:22-a, except as specifically provided in RSA 284:22-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. RSA 284:22, I, II, III, and IV shall apply according to the type of race on which the simulcast wagers are made, excepting, however, interstate common pools as provided in RSA 284:22-a, V(b) and that the provisions made for purses made in RSA 284:22, I shall not apply to simulcast races.  The commission on simulcast race pools shall be available to the simulcasting licensee to satisfy obligations to the racing association originating or transmitting such simulcast races or to the horsemen's group of such association.
