&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 284:13-a Temporary Stay Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The lottery commission may issue a temporary stay order to stay any ruling or penalty which would be incurred by the appellant if the ruling, order, or decision of the judges is allowed to stand prior to a decision in such matter by the lottery commission.  The granting of a temporary stay order by the lottery commission shall carry no presumption that the decision of the judges is or may be invalid.  The lottery commission may dissolve a temporary stay order at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A bond of $100 shall be filed with the lottery commission before consideration shall be given to granting a stay.  The bond shall be forfeited if the lottery commission considers the appeal frivolous.  If the lottery commission does not find the appeal to be frivolous, then the bond filed with the lottery commission shall be returned to the appellant within a reasonable time.
