&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 287-F:3 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
This compact is enacted to implement the operation of tri-state lotto, for the purpose of raising additional revenue for each of the party states.  Tri-state lotto is not intended to replace any existing lottery game in the party states, but, rather, to be run in addition to these games.  Tri-state lotto tickets shall be sold in each of the party states and processed in a central area to be determined by the tri-state lotto commission.  A percentage of the gross sales from each state shall be aggregated in a common prize pool, and operating costs shall be charged proportionally to the party states.  The remaining revenues generated within each state shall remain in that particular state.

The financial, tax, trust, or personal records filed, received, maintained, or produced by the commission in connection with payment of a prize as provided in this section shall be confidential.  Such records shall not be deemed public records under RSA 91-A.  Upon written request, the commission may release the name, town or residence, date of prize, and the gross and net amounts of the annual prize payment of a winner.  Financing statements filed with the commission shall be public records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-j. The tri-state lotto compact recognizes that each party state has enacted laws authorizing a party state agency to collect child support debts and arrearages.  Upon receipt of notice from a party state agency, the commission shall suspend payment of winnings in the amount of the child support debt or arrearage and notify the winner.  Child support debts and arrearages of a winner shall be offset by the commission in the manner in which the state lottery commission of a party state is required by law to offset such debts and arrearages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the person entitled to a prize on any winning ticket is under 18 years of age and if the prize is less than $5,000, the commission may make payment by delivery to an adult member of the minor's family or a guardian of the minor of a check or draft payable to the order of the minor.  If the person entitled to a prize on any winning ticket is under 18 years of age and if the prize is $5,000 or more, the commission may make payment to the minor by depositing the amount of the prize in any bank to the credit of an adult member of the minor's family or a guardian of the minor as custodian for the minor.  The commission shall be discharged of all further liability upon payment of a prize to a minor pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Prizes of less than $5,000 may be paid in such manner as the commission may direct in its rules and regulations, as long as the rules and regulations are not inconsistent with this compact.
