&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 287-F:3 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
This compact is enacted to implement the operation of tri-state lotto, for the purpose of raising additional revenue for each of the party states.  Tri-state lotto is not intended to replace any existing lottery game in the party states, but, rather, to be run in addition to these games.  Tri-state lotto tickets shall be sold in each of the party states and processed in a central area to be determined by the tri-state lotto commission.  A percentage of the gross sales from each state shall be aggregated in a common prize pool, and operating costs shall be charged proportionally to the party states.  The remaining revenues generated within each state shall remain in that particular state.
