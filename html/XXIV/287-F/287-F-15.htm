&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 287-F:15 Immunity. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission shall enjoy the sovereign immunity of the party states and neither it nor any of its officers or employees shall be sued in any court or tribunal whatsoever by any player in connection with their activities in administering the tri-state lotto game.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall not pledge the credit of the party states, or any of them individually, or impose any liability upon them, or any of them, directly or indirectly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event a dispute arises whether a ticket is a winning ticket, and regardless of whether the basis for the dispute is a claim of negligence, breach of contract, intentional tort or any other culpable conduct by the commission, its members or employees, the player's sole remedy shall be to apply to the commission for a refund of the price allegedly wagered, and whether that price is refunded lies solely within the discretion of the commission.  The provisions of this section are essential to the compact.
