<codesect>
The judgment or order of commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state or of the District of Columbia, committing a person to the veterans administration, or such other agency of the United States government for care or treatment shall have the same force and effect as to the committed person while in this state as in the jurisdiction in which is situated the court entering the judgment or making the order;  and the courts of the committing state, or of the District of Columbia, shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction of the person so committed for the purpose of inquiring into the mental condition of such person, and of determining the necessity for continuance of his restraint, as is provided in RSA 116:1 with respect to persons committed by the courts of this state.  Consent is hereby given to the application of the law of the committing state or district in respect to the authority of the chief officer of any facility of the veterans administration, or of any such institution operated in this state by any other such agency of the United States to retain custody, or transfer, parole or discharge the committed person.
