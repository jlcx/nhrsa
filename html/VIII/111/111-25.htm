&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 111:25 Severability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable.  If any provision of RSA 110-B, which, in accordance with RSA 111:6, is extended so far as is appropriate to the state guard, as well as the national guard and the unorganized militia, is found legally inapplicable, such inapplicability shall not affect the validity of that chapter in any way nor shall it affect the other provisions of this chapter, and to that extent the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable.
