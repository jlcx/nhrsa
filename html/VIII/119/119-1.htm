&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established in this state a home known as the New Hampshire veterans' home for the support, care, and treatment of veterans who have served on active duty in the armed forces of the United States as defined by 38 U.S.C. section 101, or in reserve units or in the New Hampshire army or air national guard, and have been honorably discharged therefrom.  Except as provided in paragraph II, the veteran shall have been a resident of the state of New Hampshire for at least one year next preceding the veteran's application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The one-year residency requirement shall be waived for the following veterans:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A veteran whose DD214 certificate or any document used by the veterans' home for admission states a New Hampshire address as his or her home of record upon discharge from active duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An active duty veteran who has a New Hampshire address as his or her home of record and who is being discharged directly from a medical facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The care of veterans under this section includes nursing care, assisted living, domiciliary, day care, dementia, chemical dependency and psychiatric services, and other related services and programs for any veteran otherwise eligible for admittance.  Such services and programs shall be provided at the veterans' home or contracted through other organizations and facilities, both within and outside of New Hampshire.
