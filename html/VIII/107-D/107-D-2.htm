The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A such that no person shall arrange for the transportation of or cause to be transported in, to, or through this state on the public roads or by water or by any railroad in this state any high-level radioactive waste unless such person shall notify the commissioner or designee in accordance with such rules.
