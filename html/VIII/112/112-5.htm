&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 112:5 Term of Office. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The term of office of any person appointed under authority hereof shall end upon the day prior to that on which the person for whom the temporary officer or employee of the state has been acting resumes his former position, or the equivalent thereof as provided elsewhere in this chapter.  If any such person, temporarily absent from his state employment as a member of the armed forces of the United States, becomes physically disabled while in such military service to a degree which, in the judgment of the governor and council, disqualifies him from the performance of his former state duties, or if such person shall die while in the armed forces of the United States, the person who is acting in his absence shall hold office until the vacancy has by law been filled (if it is a position which comes within the meaning of RSA 112:2) or, in the cases of other officials and employees provided for in RSA 112:3, shall continue to have all the powers, perform all the duties and assume all the responsibilities of the position he has temporarily been occupying.
