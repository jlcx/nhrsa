<codesect>
The commanding officer of each post, camp or other place, brigade, group, regiment, detached battalion or other detached command may appoint special courts-martial for the command;  but such special courts-martial may in any case be appointed by superior authority when by the latter deemed desirable.  Special courts-martial shall have the power to try any person subject to this chapter, except a commissioned officer, for any crime or offense made punishable by the military laws of the United States and of this state.  Such special courts-martial shall have the same powers of punishment as general courts-martial, except that fines imposed by such courts shall not exceed $300.
