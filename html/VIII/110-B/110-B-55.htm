I. Fines may be paid to a military court or to an officer executing its process.  The amount of any fine imposed may be noted upon any state roll or account for pay of the delinquent and deducted from any pay or allowance due or thereafter to become due them, until said fine is liquidated;  or the same may be collected with lawful costs of collection, as in the case of executions issued in action founded upon torts.  Fines shall be paid over to the state treasurer and credited to the New Hampshire national guard recruitment and retention scholarship fund under RSA 110-B:60.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A person sentenced to confinement or ordered held prior to or during trial may be committed by appropriate process under the hand of the military judge or summary court officer to any jail or house of correction within the state.  The jailer or keeper of the jail or house of correction to which such process is directed shall receive and detain the prisoner in the same manner as if the prisoner had been sentenced by the superior court sitting in the county where such jail or house of correction is located.  The adjutant general is authorized to enter into contracts with the counties for the keeping of military prisoners.  Expenses shall be borne out of funds not otherwise appropriated.
