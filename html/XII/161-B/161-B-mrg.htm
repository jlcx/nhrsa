<center><h3>Section 161-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the responsibility of the state of New Hampshire through the department of health and human services, to conserve the expenditure of public assistance funds, whenever possible, in order that such funds shall not be expended if there are private funds available or which can be made available by judicial process or otherwise to partially or completely meet the financial needs of the children of this state.  The failure of parents to provide adequate financial support and care for their children is a major cause of financial dependency on this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of this chapter is to provide this state, through the department of health and human services, a more effective and efficient way to effect the support of dependent children by the person or persons who, under the law, are primarily responsible for such support and to lighten the heavy burden of the taxpayer, who in many instances is paying toward the support of dependent children while those persons primarily responsible are avoiding their obligations.  It is the intention of the legislature that the powers delegated to the department in this chapter shall be in addition to the powers granted by RSA 161, RSA 167, or other existing laws and shall be liberally construed to the end that persons legally responsible for the care and support of children within the state be required to assume their legal obligations in order to reduce the financial cost of the state in providing public assistance funds for the care of the children.

<center><h3>Section 161-B:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-B:3 Duty of Department to Enforce Child Support. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever the department receives an application for public assistance on behalf of a child and it shall appear to the satisfaction of the department that said child has been abandoned by its parents or that the child and one parent have been abandoned by the other parent or that the parent or other person who has a responsibility for the care, support, or maintenance of such child has failed or neglected to give proper care or support to such child, the department shall take appropriate action under the provisions of this chapter, the abandonment or nonsupport statutes, or other appropriate statutes of this state to insure that such parent or other person responsible shall pay for the care, support or maintenance of said dependent child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may accept applications for support enforcement services on behalf of persons who are not recipients of public assistance and may take such action as the commissioner deems appropriate to establish or enforce support obligations against either or both parents owing a duty to provide child or medical support.  Action may be taken under this chapter, the abandonment or nonsupport statutes, or other appropriate statutes of this state, including but not limited to remedies established in RSA 161-C, to establish and enforce support obligations, provided, however, that if such child support obligation has been terminated by court order or by operation of law the commissioner may close the case in accordance with the criteria set out in federal statutes and regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may establish by rule such reasonable standards as the commissioner deems necessary to limit applications for support enforcement services.  Said standards shall take into account the income, property, or other resources already available to support the person for whom a support obligation exists.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In cases where the department is providing child support services to an individual who has never received assistance under a state program funded under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, the commissioner shall charge a fee in accordance with section 454(6) of the Social Security Act.  In all other cases where the department is providing child support services, the commissioner may charge a fee to compensate the department for services rendered in establishment of or enforcement of support obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department, through the child support unit established pursuant to RSA 161:2, XIV, shall collect support obligations for the care, support or maintenance of dependent children.  The commissioner may contract with counties, cities, towns or any other person to aid in collecting or to collect support obligations and to administer the child support program established by Title IV-D of the Federal Social Security Act and any and all amendments thereto and regulations promulgated thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Consistent with federal law and any international treaty or convention to which the United States is a party and that has been ratified by the United States Congress, the commissioner may, on approval by and with the cooperation of the governor, pursue negotiations and enter into reciprocal agreements with a foreign country or a political subdivision of a foreign country to establish and enforce child support obligations.  As a prerequisite to entering into a reciprocal agreement with this state, the foreign country or political subdivision shall have enacted laws or established procedures for the issuance and enforcement of support orders that are substantially similar to fundamental due process rights afforded to the citizens of this state, including personal and subject matter jurisdiction, notice, and an opportunity to be heard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-B:4 Payment of Child Support to the Department. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Child support payments shall be made payable through the office of child support enforcement services of the department upon written notice by the commissioner to a person responsible for the support of a dependent child or to a court or administrative agency having jurisdiction over such person that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The children for whom a support obligation exists are receiving or have received assistance pursuant to RSA 161 or RSA 167;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person has applied for or is receiving support enforcement services under RSA 161-B:3, II, and such person has certified to the department that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The arrearage on the support obligation has accumulated to an amount equal to the support obligation for one month;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A court, pursuant to RSA 173-B or RSA 458:16, has issued a protective order enjoining a parent of a child from abusing or interfering with the liberty of the child's other parent, guardian, or legal representative, and that such order remains in full force and effect at the time the person applies for child support services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notice pursuant to paragraph I shall supersede any court or administrative order to the contrary.  Any person who knowingly fails to comply with the requirement of such notice shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in paragraph I precludes the court, in its discretion, from ordering the payment of child support through the office of child support enforcement services of the department if the court finds upon the motion of any party that it is in the best interest of the child, obligee, or obligor to do so.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall give notice to an obligor who is not in compliance with a legal order of support, informing the obligor of the department's intention to certify the obligor to any appropriate licensing board.  Service of such notice shall be deemed sufficient if provided in accordance with RSA 161-B:9 and RSA 161-B:10 or as otherwise provided by law.  Notice of the department's intention to certify the obligor to any appropriate licensing board shall include:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the obligor does not request a supervisory review within 21 days of service and is not in compliance with the legal order of support, the department may certify the obligor to any appropriate board for the purpose of suspending, revoking, or denying the issuance or renewal of any appropriate license or licenses, unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The obligor comes into compliance with the legal order of support;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A motion to modify is pending at the time of certification, or the obligor has filed a motion with the court to modify the legal order of support, within 21 days of the service of the notice of noncompliance, pursuant to which the court could change the obligor's support obligation, amount of arrearage owed, or the amount of the payment toward the arrearage.  The motion to modify may request that the court make a determination of good cause without the need to request a supervisory review, provided such claim is made within 21 days of the service of the notice of noncompliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Within 30 days of the written decision pursuant to the supervisory review, the obligor may request an administrative hearing to contest the issue of compliance.  A request for hearing must be received by the department within 30 days of the written decision pursuant to the supervisory review.  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearings officer in accordance with rules for fair hearings adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A.  The issues that may be considered at hearing are limited to mistake of fact and whether the obligor is in compliance with a legal order of support.  The hearings officer shall issue a written decision within 20 days of the hearing and forward the decision to the obligor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Within 30 days of the written decision pursuant to the administrative hearing, the obligor may appeal to the superior court.  Such appeal shall be restricted to a review of the record.  Upon review of the record, the court in its discretion may request the submission of additional evidence and order a hearing on the additional evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 10 days of certification, the appropriate board shall notify the obligor that the obligor's license or licenses have been revoked due to such certification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Once the department certifies to a licensing board that an obligor is not in compliance with a legal order of support or a license has been revoked pursuant to this chapter, the board shall refuse to issue or reissue a license until the obligor provides the board with a release from the department which states that the obligor is in compliance with the legal order of support.  The obligor shall not be permitted to challenge the certification before any licensing board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When an obligor, after certification, subsequently complies with the legal order of support, the department shall provide the obligor with a written release indicating that the obligor is in compliance with the legal order of support.  Upon the obligor providing the appropriate board with a copy of the release, the board shall grant, reissue, or renew the license or licenses of the obligor in accordance with the issuing authority of the licensing board and subject to administrative costs and fees of the licensing board, if any, unless such license has otherwise been revoked.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-a. The social security number of any applicant for a professional license, commercial driver's license, occupational license, or marriage license shall be recorded on the application, provided that if the use of a number other than the social security number is allowed, the applicant shall be so advised.  Any application required by this section to contain a social security number shall be confidential and not subject to the right to know law.  The use of such number shall be limited to proceedings or actions to establish paternity or to establish or enforce support and shall only be provided to or entered in any out-of-state or federal data base for those cases for which the department is providing services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements with the various licensing boards as necessary to implement this chapter.
