II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, with the exception of tax statutes, and in order to effectuate the purposes of this section, the commissioner may request cooperation from state, county and local agencies in the location of parents or other legally liable persons who have abandoned or deserted, or are failing to support a dependent child (or any other child) and information relative to the location, income and property of such parents and it shall be the duty of such persons to cooperate in responding to such requests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any records established or information collected pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be made available only to the commissioner and the attorney general and their authorized designees, attorneys responsible for the administration of RSA 546-B, attorneys or authorized staff employed by the department, or its contracted agents, to administer programs under Title IV, Part A (TANF), Title IV, Part B (child and family services), Title IV, Part D (child support and establishment of paternity), Title IV, Part E (foster care and adoption assistance), Title XIX (medical assistance programs), Title XX (social services block grants), or Title XXI (state children's health insurance program) of the Social Security Act, the client or the client's authorized representative, authorized court employees, and courts or agencies in other states engaged in the enforcement of support of minor children as authorized by federal law or the rules of the department.  Such records and information shall be available and used only for purposes directly connected with the establishment, enforcement, or modification of child support, the department's administration of programs under Title IV, Part A (TANF), Title IV, Part B (child and family services), Title IV, Part D (child support and establishment of paternity), Title IV, Part E (foster care and adoption assistance), Title XIX (medical assistance programs), Title XX (social services block grants), or Title XXI (state children's health insurance program) of the Social Security Act, court administration of cases filed under this chapter, RSA 461-A, and RSA 546-B that are administered by the office of child support, and the administration of this chapter.  The records and information made available to the client or the client's authorized representative shall not include information provided to the department that is prohibited from release by federal law, state statute, state case law, or by contract or agreement between the department and another entity if such contract or agreement prohibits release of such information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All support orders issued or modified in cases that are payable through the department shall contain a provision requiring the obligor to keep the department informed of the name and address of the obligor's employer and whether the obligor has access to health insurance, and, if so, the health insurance policy information as requested by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner of the department of health and human services and the administrator of the office of child support enforcement services shall develop the data collection capacity to monitor the efficacy of child support collection efforts on behalf of households whose aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) benefits have terminated within the last 24 months or which contain a medicaid-eligible person.  The commissioner and administrator shall then use their best efforts to assure that these at-risk households are encouraged to utilize the services of the office of child support services, and that the rate of child support collection on behalf of these households shall be increased and maintained at a level that is at least as great as the rate of child support collected on behalf of households that are current recipients of AFDC.
