&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-B:3 Duty of Department to Enforce Child Support. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever the department receives an application for public assistance on behalf of a child and it shall appear to the satisfaction of the department that said child has been abandoned by its parents or that the child and one parent have been abandoned by the other parent or that the parent or other person who has a responsibility for the care, support, or maintenance of such child has failed or neglected to give proper care or support to such child, the department shall take appropriate action under the provisions of this chapter, the abandonment or nonsupport statutes, or other appropriate statutes of this state to insure that such parent or other person responsible shall pay for the care, support or maintenance of said dependent child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may accept applications for support enforcement services on behalf of persons who are not recipients of public assistance and may take such action as the commissioner deems appropriate to establish or enforce support obligations against either or both parents owing a duty to provide child or medical support.  Action may be taken under this chapter, the abandonment or nonsupport statutes, or other appropriate statutes of this state, including but not limited to remedies established in RSA 161-C, to establish and enforce support obligations, provided, however, that if such child support obligation has been terminated by court order or by operation of law the commissioner may close the case in accordance with the criteria set out in federal statutes and regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may establish by rule such reasonable standards as the commissioner deems necessary to limit applications for support enforcement services.  Said standards shall take into account the income, property, or other resources already available to support the person for whom a support obligation exists.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In cases where the department is providing child support services to an individual who has never received assistance under a state program funded under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, the commissioner shall charge a fee in accordance with section 454(6) of the Social Security Act.  In all other cases where the department is providing child support services, the commissioner may charge a fee to compensate the department for services rendered in establishment of or enforcement of support obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department, through the child support unit established pursuant to RSA 161:2, XIV, shall collect support obligations for the care, support or maintenance of dependent children.  The commissioner may contract with counties, cities, towns or any other person to aid in collecting or to collect support obligations and to administer the child support program established by Title IV-D of the Federal Social Security Act and any and all amendments thereto and regulations promulgated thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Consistent with federal law and any international treaty or convention to which the United States is a party and that has been ratified by the United States Congress, the commissioner may, on approval by and with the cooperation of the governor, pursue negotiations and enter into reciprocal agreements with a foreign country or a political subdivision of a foreign country to establish and enforce child support obligations.  As a prerequisite to entering into a reciprocal agreement with this state, the foreign country or political subdivision shall have enacted laws or established procedures for the issuance and enforcement of support orders that are substantially similar to fundamental due process rights afforded to the citizens of this state, including personal and subject matter jurisdiction, notice, and an opportunity to be heard.
