I. "Economic revitalization zone'' means a zone with a single continuous boundary, comprised of one or more contiguous census tracts or blocks or smaller recognizable physical areas, designated in accordance with the rules adopted under RSA 162-N:8, and certified by the commissioner of resources and economic development as being a brownfields site as defined under RSA 147-F, or having at least one of the following characteristics:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The population of the municipality or municipalities in which the zone is located, according to the most recent federal census, decreased during the 20 years prior to the census.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The median household income in the census tract or tracts in which the zone is located is less than 70 percent of the state median household income according to the federal census bureau's American Community Survey as it has been reported every 5 years beginning with 2010.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At least 20 percent of households in the census tract or tracts in which the zone is located have a median income below the federal poverty level.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Certification of the zone as an economic revitalization zone would likely result in the reduction of the rate of vacant or demolished structures or the rate of tax delinquency in the zone.
