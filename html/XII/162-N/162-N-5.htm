The aggregate of tax credits issued by the commissioner of resources and economic development to all taxpayers claiming the credit shall not exceed $825,000 for any calendar year, except that any amount of the credit less than $825,000 that is not claimed in the calendar year may be issued in the next calendar year and in following years.  Amounts carried forward pursuant to RSA 162-N:7 shall not be counted against this limit in any year in which they are applied.  Notwithstanding RSA 162-N:6, the maximum credit which may be utilized by a taxpayer in any calendar year shall not exceed $40,000.  In the case in which the aggregate credits requested during the calendar year exceed the amount available, each taxpayer shall receive a credit for the proportional share of the maximum aggregate credit amount.
