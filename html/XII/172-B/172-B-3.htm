The period of protective custody shall end when the person is released to a designated alcohol counselor, a clinical staff person of an approved alcohol treatment program with detoxification capabilities, or a professional medical staff person at a licensed general hospital emergency room.  The person may be released to his own devices if at any time the officer judges him to be no longer incapacitated.  Protective custody shall in no event exceed 24 hours.

III.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A taking into protective custody under this section is not an arrest, however nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prevent an officer or jailer from obtaining proper identification from a person taken into protective custody or from conducting a search of such person to reduce the likelihood of injury to the officer or jailer, the person taken into protective custody, or others.  No unnecessary or unreasonable force or means of restraint may be used in detaining any person taken into protective custody.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Peace officers or persons responsible for supervision in a local jail or designated alcohol counselors who act under the authority of this section are acting in the course of their official duty and are not criminally or civilly liable therefor, unless for gross negligence or willful or wanton injury.
