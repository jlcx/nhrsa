The director is authorized to accept in the name of the state special grants or money or services from the federal or state governments or any of their agencies and may accept gifts to carry out the purposes of this chapter.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the period in which the office of alcohol and drug abuse prevention is located administratively in the office of the governor, no new personnel positions in the office of alcohol and drug abuse prevention may be created by the acceptance of federal monies or monies from any other source unless such positions are approved by the fiscal committee of the general court;  provided, however, that the governor and council may accept all monies available for any emergency or disaster as defined by the authority awarding such monies to the office of alcohol and drug abuse prevention.  Nothing herein shall be construed to affect the provisions of RSA 98:17-a or RSA 124.  All monies which fund personnel positions subject to these restrictions shall be used only for the purposes or programs specified in the application for approval of the positions or as otherwise approved by law.
