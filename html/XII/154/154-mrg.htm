&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 154:1-d Fire Department Liability;  Public Duty Rule;  Status of Firefighters. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Firefighting and other emergency service provided by a fire department shall not, in itself, be deemed to be the making of a promise, or the undertaking of a special duty, towards any person for such services, or any particular level of, or manner of providing, such services;  nor shall the provision of, or failure to provide, such services be deemed to create a special relationship or duty towards any person, upon which an action in negligence or other tort might be founded.  Specifically:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The failure to respond to a fire or other emergency, or to undertake particular inspections or types of inspections, or to maintain any particular level of personnel, equipment or facilities, shall not be a breach of any duty to persons affected by any fire or other emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a fire department does undertake to respond to a fire or other emergency, the failure to provide the same level or manner of service, or equivalent availability or allocation of resources as may or could be provided, shall not be a breach of any duty to persons affected by that fire or other emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A fire department shall not have or assume any duty towards any person to adopt, use, or avoid any particular strategy or tactic in responding to a fire or other emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A fire department, in undertaking fire prevention activities, including inspections, or in undertaking to respond to a fire or other emergency, shall not have voluntarily assumed any special duty with respect to any risks which were not created or caused by it, nor with respect to any risks which might have existed even in the absence of such activity or response, nor shall any person have a right to rely on any such assumption of duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In this section, "fire department'' means any fire department of the state or its political subdivisions, including municipal fire departments organized under RSA 154:1, as well as private firefighting units which have been certified by the state fire marshal under RSA 153:4-a.  For the purposes of this section and in addition to any other protections afforded to state agencies under law, the division of fire services, department of safety, shall be deemed a "fire department.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any firefighter, paid or volunteer, who is acting in an official capacity under the direction or supervision of the elected or appointed fire chief, or designee, of a municipal fire department organized in accordance with RSA 154:1, or who is participating in a fire department activity sanctioned by the local governing body or its designee, shall be an agent of the municipality, enjoying the same privileges and immunities as the municipality or employees of the municipality.  Such privileges and immunities include, but are not limited to, indemnification for civil rights damages to the extent set forth in RSA 31:106, and indemnification for any other accidental damages to the extent set forth in RSA 31:105, if the municipality has adopted that section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Decisions of a fire chief or the chief's subordinates concerning the allocation and assignment of firefighters and equipment, and the strategies and tactics used, shall be the exercise of a discretionary, policy function for which neither the officer nor a municipality shall be held liable in the absence of malice or bad faith, even when such decisions are made rapidly in response to the exigencies of an emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This section shall not be construed to affect the application of common law immunities, or of other statutes which may pertain to the liability of municipalities or firefighters, including, but not limited to RSA 507-B and RSA 508:17.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 154:8-a Liability Concerning Hazardous Materials Accidents. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person who provides assistance or advice in mitigating or attempting to mitigate the effects of an actual or threatened discharge of hazardous materials or wastes or in preventing, cleaning up, or disposing of or in attempting to prevent, clean up or dispose of any such discharge shall be subject to civil liabilities or penalties of any kind, providing that such assistance or advice is rendered at the request of state, county or local officials in charge at the emergency scene.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The immunities provided in this section shall not apply to any person:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whose act or omission caused in whole or in part such actual or threatened discharge and who would otherwise be liable therefor;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Who receives compensation other than reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for services in rendering such assistance or advice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Definitions.  As used in this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Discharge'' shall include leakage, seepage, or other release of hazardous materials or wastes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Hazardous materials'' means hazardous materials as defined in RSA 147-B:2, VIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Wastes'' means wastes as defined in RSA 147-B:2, VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. (a) Any person whose act or omission caused the actual or threatened discharge of hazardous materials or toxic wastes which resulted in the reasonable and proportionate response of police, fire, emergency preparedness, or emergency response equipment shall be responsible for payment of the cost of the equipment use or replacement of the equipment used, if damaged or expended, in containing the hazardous materials or toxic wastes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any person whose act or omission caused the actual or threatened discharge of hazardous materials or toxic wastes which resulted in the reasonable and proportionate response of police, fire, emergency preparedness, or emergency response equipment shall be responsible for payment of the personnel costs of police, fire, public safety, and municipal personnel, including mutual aid standby personnel, directly involved in the emergency response and any reasonable court costs and legal fees incurred by the municipality, organization, or mutual aid district in collecting costs or defending an unsuccessful appeal of such costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The response to fires or other emergencies where the discharge of hazardous materials is incidental to the fire or other emergency and does not require the use of specialized hazardous materials response equipment or personnel specially trained pursuant to 40 C.F.R. section 311 shall not be costs eligible for reimbursement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Within 30 days after the equipment leaves the site of the incident, the municipality, organization, or mutual aid district which seeks payment shall submit a bill for cost of equipment use, equipment cleanup, or equipment replacement and the costs of personnel, if applicable, to the person responsible for the equipment contamination under subparagraph (a) and the costs of personnel under subparagraph (b).  At the time of billing, the municipality, organization, or mutual aid district which seeks payment shall notify the billed party that an appeal may be filed with the commissioner of safety within 30 days of the receipt of the bill.  Payment shall be made directly to the municipality, to the organization, or to the mutual aid district.  A municipality, organization, or mutual aid district within whose jurisdiction the incident occurs is authorized to collect payment on behalf of the municipalities, organizations, or mutual aid districts that participated in the response and to disburse payment accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The person responsible for the equipment contamination may appeal payment for such costs within 30 days of receipt of the bill for the costs to the commissioner of safety.  The commissioner shall hold an administrative hearing within 30 days after receiving the appeal, at which time the extent of liability for costs shall be determined.  The commissioner shall issue a decision within 30 days after holding the hearing.  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner under this section may appeal the decision to the superior court in the same manner as that prescribed in RSA 263:75, II and III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If no appeal is filed within 30 days after receipt of the bill, the person responsible for the hazardous materials response shall be deemed to have waived all rights to appeal and shall be liable to the municipality, organization, or mutual aid district for the total amount billed, subject to the additional penalty and interest set forth under subparagraph (h) in the case of nonpayment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The commissioner of safety shall establish rates for equipment use, supplies, and costs of personnel that shall be the maximum amount that may be charged by any municipality, organization, or mutual aid district in accordance with this section.  The rates and costs, and guidelines for establishing them, shall be adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A.  To the extent possible, the rates and costs shall reflect the actual expenses, including overhead costs, for emergency response to hazardous materials incidents for municipalities throughout the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A one-time penalty of $1,000 plus interest assessed at the rate of interest established in RSA 336:1, may be assessed for nonpayment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the liability of any person for damages resulting from such person's gross negligence or from such person's willful, reckless or wanton misconduct.

Each fire department shall send one delegate to the organizational and subsequent meetings and shall be entitled to one vote in all proceedings.  The delegate shall be the chief of each fire department or such alternate as the chief may designate.  At the organizational meeting, the members of the system shall adopt articles of association and bylaws and regulations for the future government and operation of the system which shall be effective upon submission to and approval by the attorney general, who shall cause the same to be recorded by the secretary of state.  The system shall be deemed to have been formally established upon such recording.  The organizational meeting shall also elect a board of directors consisting of such number as they may determine.  Delegates and directors need not be residents.  The board of directors shall be the governing body of the system and shall serve for terms of one year and until their successors are elected and qualify, provided that the organizational meeting, or any subsequent meeting, may vote to elect its directors for varying terms.  If a meeting shall so vote for the first election under said vote one director shall be elected for a term of one year, one for a term of 2 years, one for a term of 3 years, one for a term of 4 years, and one for a term of 5 years, and thereafter there shall be elected at each annual meeting one director for a term of 5 years and until a successor is elected and qualified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The directors shall choose from their number the officers of the system, who shall have such duties and powers as the bylaws provide.  Within the limits of available funds, the directors may employ and fix the compensation of agents and other necessary personnel, who shall serve at their pleasure and have and exercise such powers and authority as they may delegate to them.
