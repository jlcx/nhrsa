<center><h3>Section 153-A:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 153-A:1 Declaration of Policy and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court declares that it is the policy of the state of New Hampshire to save lives and speed the healing of persons in need of medical services by providing an emergency medical and trauma services system that will bring an injured or sick person under the care of properly trained individuals in the shortest practical time, and that will provide safe transportation to the most appropriate treatment center prepared to receive the sick or injured person.  It is the policy of the state of New Hampshire to insure that the sick or injured person is safely transported in properly equipped vehicles which are designed to supply supportive care and which are able to communicate with medical treatment centers.  The use of properly licensed wheelchair vans for hire is to ensure that patients confined to a wheelchair are transported in equipped vehicles driven by personnel approved by the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court recognizes that traumatic injury is a health problem in the state of New Hampshire and a cause of unnecessary death and that an organized system for the delivery of trauma care services in New Hampshire should be available.  Emergency medical services in rural and wilderness areas require adequately trained and equipped personnel to treat and transport trauma victims.  Therefore, the general court declares that the establishment of a coordinated statewide trauma and injury prevention system will benefit all residents and visitors to New Hampshire by reducing the incidence of traumatic injury and minimizing human suffering and disability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The general court, recognizing that the provision of emergency medical and trauma services at the local level is a continuation of a long and valued tradition of neighbor helping neighbor that should be encouraged and maintained, and that the individual providers of emergency medical care must be part of a comprehensive system of care delivery, declares that it is the purpose of this chapter to assure the development, coordination, and administration of an emergency medical and trauma services system that reflects the differing needs and abilities of the state's communities and regions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The general court further recognizes that the delivery of adequate pre-hospital care is reliant on the thorough cooperation of the emergency medical care providers and, therefore, the general court urges the emergency medical care providers to cooperate with and follow the lead of each emergency medical service unit's medical resource hospital.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The general court recognizes that volunteers make up a large portion of the staffing of the emergency medical service units, especially in the northern portion of the state.  Therefore, the general court believes that the training levels for minimum certification as an emergency medical care provider should continue to allow future volunteer emergency medical care provider participation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The general court declares that, to the extent it is possible, it is the policy of the state of New Hampshire to allow patients to be transported to the hospital, medical facility, or location of their choice in their area, if there is no compelling medical reason to the contrary.  Further, the general court declares that, if appropriate, durable power of attorney for health care and the living will statutes should be taken into consideration in providing emergency medical and trauma services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 153-A:17-a Critical Incident Intervention and Management. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Critical incident'' means an event or events that result in acute or cumulative psychological stress or trauma to an emergency service provider as a result of response to the incident.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Critical incident stress'' means an unusually strong emotional, cognitive, or physical reaction that has the potential to interfere with normal functioning and that results from the response to a critical incident or long-term occupational exposure to a series of critical incident responses over a period of time that are believed to be causing debilitating stress that is affecting an emergency service provider and his or her work performance or family situation.  This may include, but is not limited to, physical and emotional illness, failure of usual coping mechanisms, loss of interest in the job, personality changes, or loss of ability to function.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Critical incident stress management'' means a process of crisis intervention designed to assist emergency service providers in coping with the psychological trauma resulting from response to a critical incident.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Critical incident stress management and crisis intervention services'' means consultation, counseling, debriefing, defusing, intervention services, management, prevention, and referral provided by a critical incident stress management team member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) "Critical incident stress management team'' or "team'' means the group of one or more trained volunteers, including members of peer support groups organized by a unit of state, local, or county government who offer critical incident stress management and crisis intervention services following a critical incident or long term or continued, debilitating stress being experienced by emergency services providers and affecting them or their family situation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) "Critical incident stress management team member'' or "team member'' means an emergency services provider, including any law enforcement officer, sheriff or deputy sheriff, state police officer, civilian law enforcement employee, firefighter, civilian fire department employee, and emergency medical personnel, specially trained to provide critical incident stress management and crisis intervention services as a member of an organized and registered team.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Team members shall undergo and sustain certification standards set forth in guidelines established by the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation (ICISF) approved by the commissioner of the department of safety, or a similar organization for which the commissioner shall not unreasonably withhold approval.  The team shall be registered with ICISF, or a similar organization, and maintain training standards to date as required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) All critical incident stress management team members, sworn or civilian, shall be designated by the police chief, sheriff, commander of the state police, fire chief, or director of emergency services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Any information divulged to the team or a team member during the provision of critical incident stress management and crisis intervention services shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed to a third party or in a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding.  Records kept by critical incident stress management team members are not subject to subpoena, discovery, or introduction into evidence in a criminal, civil, or administrative action.  Except as provided in subparagraph (c), no person, whether critical incident stress management team member or team leader providing or receiving critical incident stress management and crisis intervention services, shall be required to testify or divulge any information obtained solely through such crisis intervention.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The purpose of this section is to provide a consistent framework for the operation of critical incident stress management teams and their members.  In any civil action against any individual, agency, or government entity, including the state of New Hampshire, arising out of the conduct of a member of such team, this section is not intended and shall not be admissible to establish negligence in any instance where requirements herein are higher than the standard of care that would otherwise have been applicable in such action under state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A communication shall not be deemed confidential pursuant to this section if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The communication indicates the existence of a danger to the individual who receives critical incident stress management and crisis intervention services or to any other person or persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The communication indicates the existence of past child abuse or neglect of the individual, abuse of an adult as defined by law, or family violence as defined by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The communication indicates the existence of past or present acts constituting an intentional tort or crime, provided the applicable statute of limitation has not expired on the act indicated.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The system of emergency medical services in this state shall include provisions for appropriate system response to incidents beyond the resource capabilities of individual emergency medical service units available on a regular daily basis.  Written mutual aid arrangements may be established with neighboring emergency medical services systems to insure integration of care and shall consider the role of nonemergency medical services public safety agencies, their roles, relationships, and responsibilities in standard operation.  A written mutual aid arrangement shall specify who shall be responsible for the direction of medical care at the scene.  In the absence of a written agreement, while in the performance of their duties extending emergency medical services in a mutual aid situation, emergency medical care providers shall be under the overall direction of the local authority having jurisdiction but subject to medical control, as defined under RSA 153-A:2, XIV, and such providers shall have the immunities and privileges as if performing the same duties within their respective service areas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any emergency medical service unit may enter into a mutual aid agreement with other emergency medical service units, within or outside the state, for purposes of rendering aid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit any emergency medical service unit extending such aid from donating equipment and services and assuming the damage or loss to such equipment or personnel.  Any mutual aid agreement may authorize the head of the emergency medical service unit to extend such aid, subject to such conditions and restrictions, as may be prescribed in the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. There shall be no liability imposed by law on the emergency medical service unit, on any municipality, or on the personnel of the emergency medical service unit, for failure to respond or to respond reasonably for the purpose of rendering aid under a mutual aid agreement.  This immunity is not intended to be exclusive of other immunities existing by statute, or at common law.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Quality management program'' means a comprehensive, continuous, and organization-wide evaluation and measurement system established in accordance with the rules and definitions adopted by the division of fire standards and training and emergency medical services.  The system shall be used to evaluate and monitor the quality and appropriateness of system operation and the care provided to patients in order to identify sentinel events and trends so that corrective action may be taken by the local provider agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Records'' means records of interviews, internal review and investigations, and all reports, statements, minutes, memoranda, charts, statistics, and other documentation generated during the activities of a quality management program.  "Records'' shall not mean original medical records or other records kept relative to any patient in the course of the business of operating as an emergency medical services unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Records of a quality management program shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.  However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as immune from discovery or use in any such civil or administrative action merely because they were presented to a quality management program, and any person who supplies information or testifies as part of a quality management program, or who is a member of a quality management program committee, may not be prevented from testifying as to matters within his or her knowledge, but such witness may not be asked about his or her testimony before such program, or opinions formed by him or her, as a result of committee participation.  Further, a program's records shall be discoverable in either of the following cases:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the commissioner to revoke or restrict the license or certification of an emergency medical care provider or other person licensed under this chapter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A proceeding alleging repetitive malicious action and personal injury brought against an emergency medical care provider or other person licensed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No person or entity shall be held liable in any action for damages or other relief arising from their good faith participation in a quality management program, or from the providing of information to a quality management program or in any judicial or administrative proceeding.
