I. This chapter shall not be construed to restrict a licensed physician, registered nurse, or physician assistant from serving on an emergency medical service unit at any level of licensure, provided that they have been certified by the commissioner as having education and training appropriate to the delivery of emergency medical services.  The commissioner shall establish the qualifications required for such certification.  The qualifications for certification shall be adopted as rule under RSA 153-A:20.
