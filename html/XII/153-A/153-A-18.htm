<codesect>
No licensed emergency medical care provider or any health professional shall be subject to civil liability based solely upon failure to obtain consent in rendering emergency medical services to any person, regardless of age, where the person is unable to give consent for any reason, including minority, and where there is no other person reasonably available who is legally authorized to give consent to the providing of such care, provided that the licensed emergency medical care provider, or health professional, has acted in good faith without knowledge of facts negating consent.
