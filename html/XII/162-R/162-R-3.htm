&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) To initiate the application process, a developer may file with the department of transportation, a request for a preliminary conceptual feasibility study, including such project-specific information as the department may specify in accordance with the department's utility accommodation manual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 30 days after such study request is filed, the department shall provide written notice to the developer, with a copy to the site evaluation committee, either accepting such study request as sufficiently complete to allow the department to evaluate the conceptual feasibility of the proposal and submit its recommendation to the committee, or specifying the additional information needed to complete its evaluation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon notice to the developer that the study request is deemed sufficiently complete for its purposes under subparagraph (a), the department shall have 60 days to determine whether and to what extent the proposed project route would be conceptually feasible within the applicable state-owned transportation right-of-way or rights-of-way, based on department standards and regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Within 60 days after notice to the developer that its submission has been deemed complete, the department shall submit its report on the conceptual feasibility of the project to the developer and the site evaluation committee, specifying any concerns or issues it believes the committee should consider in its review of the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The site evaluation committee shall determine whether the application is complete, and shall proceed to review a completed application under RSA 162-H.
