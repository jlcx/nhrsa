<codesect>
In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Owner'' means a person, partnership, association, or corporation who is the holder of title to, or who leases a boiler or boilers or pressure vessels from the holder of title to, a building in which there are a boiler or boilers or pressure vessels as defined in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Commissioner'' means the commissioner of labor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Boiler'' means a closed vessel in which water or other fluid is heated, steam is generated, steam is superheated, or any combination thereof, under pressure or vacuum for use externally to itself by the direct application of heat from the combustion of fuels, or from electricity or nuclear energy.  This term also includes fired units for heating or vaporizing liquids other than water where these units are separate from processing systems and are complete within themselves.  The term "boiler'' shall also include the apparatus by which heat is generated and all controls and safety devices associated with such apparatus or closed vessels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Power boiler'' means a boiler in which steam or other vapor (to be used externally to itself) is generated at a pressure of more than 15 psig.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "High pressure-high temperature boiler'' means a boiler in which water or other fluid is heated and operating at pressures exceeding 160 psig or temperatures exceeding 250%A1 F.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Low pressure boiler'' means a steam boiler operating at pressures not exceeding 15 psig, or a hot water heating boiler operating at pressures not exceeding 160 psig or temperatures not exceeding 250%A1 F.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Pressure vessel'' means a vessel in which the pressure is obtained from an external source or by the application of heat from an indirect source.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Certificate inspection'' means an inspection, the report of which is used by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative to decide whether or not a certificate, as provided by RSA 157-A:9, may be issued.  This certificate inspection shall be an internal inspection when the construction permits;  otherwise, it shall be an inspection as complete as possible.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An inspector shall have free access during reasonable hours to any premises in the state where a boiler or pressure vessel is being constructed, or is being installed, or is being operated, for the purpose of ascertaining whether such boiler is being constructed or is being installed or operated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each boiler and pressure vessel used or proposed to be used within this state, except boilers or pressure vessels exempt under RSA 157-A:6, shall be thoroughly inspected as to their construction, installation, and condition as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Power boilers and high pressure-high temperature boilers shall receive a certificate inspection annually and shall also be externally inspected annually while under pressure, if possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Low pressure steam or vapor heating boilers, except those constructed of cast iron, shall receive a certificate inspection biennially with an internal inspection at least every 4 years where construction permits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(d) Heating boilers and hot water supply boilers constructed of cast iron shall receive a certificate inspection biennially.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Pressure vessels subject to internal corrosion shall receive certificate inspection biennially.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Pressure vessels not subject to internal corrosion shall receive a certificate inspection at intervals set by the commissioner, but internal inspection shall not be required of pressure vessels, the contents of which are known to be non-corrosive to the material of which the shell, heads, or fittings are constructed, either from the chemical composition of the contents or from evidence that the contents are adequately treated with a corrosion inhibitor, provided that such vessels are constructed in accordance with the rules of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A grace period of 2 months beyond the period specified in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this paragraph may elapse between certificate inspections.  Prior to the expiration of the 2-month grace period, the owner or user of the boiler or pressure vessel shall receive a written warning from the department of labor for any required inspection which was not completed prior to the expiration of the inspection certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The commissioner may, at the commissioner's discretion, permit longer periods between certificate inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

IV. If, at the discretion of the inspector, a hydrostatic test or other test is deemed necessary, it shall be made by the owner of the boiler or pressure vessel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All boilers, other than cast iron sectional boilers, and pressure vessels to be installed in this state shall be inspected during construction as required by the applicable rules of the commissioner by an inspector authorized to inspect boilers and pressure vessels in this state or, if constructed outside this state, by an inspector holding a commission or license as an inspector of boilers and pressure vessels for a state that has substantially standard requirements to be an inspector equal to those of this state.
