&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Owner'' means a person, partnership, association, or corporation who is the holder of title to, or who leases a boiler or boilers or pressure vessels from the holder of title to, a building in which there are a boiler or boilers or pressure vessels as defined in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Commissioner'' means the commissioner of labor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Boiler'' means a closed vessel in which water or other fluid is heated, steam is generated, steam is superheated, or any combination thereof, under pressure or vacuum for use externally to itself by the direct application of heat from the combustion of fuels, or from electricity or nuclear energy.  This term also includes fired units for heating or vaporizing liquids other than water where these units are separate from processing systems and are complete within themselves.  The term "boiler'' shall also include the apparatus by which heat is generated and all controls and safety devices associated with such apparatus or closed vessels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Power boiler'' means a boiler in which steam or other vapor (to be used externally to itself) is generated at a pressure of more than 15 psig.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "High pressure-high temperature boiler'' means a boiler in which water or other fluid is heated and operating at pressures exceeding 160 psig or temperatures exceeding 250%A1 F.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Low pressure boiler'' means a steam boiler operating at pressures not exceeding 15 psig, or a hot water heating boiler operating at pressures not exceeding 160 psig or temperatures not exceeding 250%A1 F.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Pressure vessel'' means a vessel in which the pressure is obtained from an external source or by the application of heat from an indirect source.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Certificate inspection'' means an inspection, the report of which is used by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative to decide whether or not a certificate, as provided by RSA 157-A:9, may be issued.
