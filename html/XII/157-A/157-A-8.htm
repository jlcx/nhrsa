&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An inspector shall have free access during reasonable hours to any premises in the state where a boiler or pressure vessel is being constructed, or is being installed, or is being operated, for the purpose of ascertaining whether such boiler is being constructed or is being installed or operated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each boiler and pressure vessel used or proposed to be used within this state, except boilers or pressure vessels exempt under RSA 157-A:6, shall be thoroughly inspected as to their construction, installation, and condition as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Power boilers and high pressure-high temperature boilers shall receive a certificate inspection annually and shall also be externally inspected annually while under pressure, if possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Low pressure steam or vapor heating boilers, except those constructed of cast iron, shall receive a certificate inspection biennially with an internal inspection at least every 4 years where construction permits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Hot water heating boilers, hot water supply boilers, except those constructed of cast iron, hot water heaters and hot water storage tanks shall receive a certificate inspection biennially with an internal inspection at the discretion of the inspector.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Heating boilers and hot water supply boilers constructed of cast iron shall receive a certificate inspection biennially.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Pressure vessels subject to internal corrosion shall receive certificate inspection biennially.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Pressure vessels not subject to internal corrosion shall receive a certificate inspection at intervals set by the commissioner, but internal inspection shall not be required of pressure vessels, the contents of which are known to be non-corrosive to the material of which the shell, heads, or fittings are constructed, either from the chemical composition of the contents or from evidence that the contents are adequately treated with a corrosion inhibitor, provided that such vessels are constructed in accordance with the rules of the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A grace period of 2 months beyond the period specified in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this paragraph may elapse between certificate inspections.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All boilers, other than cast iron sectional boilers, and pressure vessels to be installed in this state shall be inspected during construction as required by the applicable rules of the commissioner by an inspector authorized to inspect boilers and pressure vessels in this state or, if constructed outside this state, by an inspector holding a commission or license as an inspector of boilers and pressure vessels for a state that has substantially standard requirements to be an inspector equal to those of this state.
