<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Subsequent to the inspection of a boiler or pressure vessel, an inspector shall file with the commissioner an inspection report on a form prescribed by the commissioner indicating whether or not the inspected object is certifiable and shall communicate the results of such inspection to the owner or the owner's designee.  When an object passes inspection, the commissioner shall furnish an inspection certificate to its owner or the owner's designee on a form prescribed by the commissioner.  A fee of $50 shall be charged for each certificate.  If the fee is not paid within 30 days of the date on which the certificate is issued, the certificate shall be void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the object fails the inspection, the inspector shall furnish the owner or the owner's designee an appropriate abstract of the statutory requirements and recommendations for repairs necessary to correct the deficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon compliance with the recommendations of an inspector, either by repair or replacement, the owner of a boiler or vessel which has failed to pass inspection, or the owner's designee, shall notify the commissioner and inspector that the required repairs have been completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The boiler or vessel shall, at the discretion of the inspector or the commissioner, then be reinspected in accordance with this section;  and, upon finding compliance with the recommendations, an inspection certificate shall be furnished to the owner or the owner's designee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Certificates shall be conspicuously displayed in the vicinity of the boiler or vessel.
