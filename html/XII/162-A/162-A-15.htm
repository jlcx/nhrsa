<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI. The authority may issue bonds pursuant to this section which shall be obligations of the authority and not general obligations of the state, except as provided in RSA 162-A:17.  Such bonds may be issued from time to time consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter to make expenditures in aid of local development organizations under RSA 162-A:7, to make temporary loans to businesses under RSA 162-A:9, to acquire loans under RSA 162-A:10, to fund the guarantee fund established under RSA 162-A:11, to make contributions to CAP funds under RSA 162-A:12, to pay or refund any bonds issued pursuant to this section or interest thereon, or to pay the costs and expenses of the authority.  The principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all bonds shall be payable solely by the authority in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  The bonds shall be issued by the authority in such amounts as the board shall determine, not exceeding in the aggregate at any time $25,000,000.  Bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker's loan rate or other method as may be determined by the authority, and shall mature at such time or times as may be determined by the authority, except that no bonds shall mature more than 30 years from their date of issue.  Bonds may be made redeemable before maturity either at the option of the authority or at the option of the holder, or upon the occurrence of specified events, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds.  The authority shall determine the form and details of the bond.  The bonds may be sold in such manner, either at public or private sale, for such price, at such rate or rates of interest, or at such discount in lieu of interest as the authority may determine.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Every bond shall be signed on behalf of the authority by 2 persons designated by the authority.  One person shall be a member of the board who is also the chairperson of the board, or the vice chairperson of the board, or the treasurer of the authority, or an assistant treasurer of the authority.  The other person shall be any member of the board or the executive director of the authority.  The signatures may be manual or facsimile but at least one signature on every bond shall be manual, unless the bond bears a manual authentication or certification by a bank, trust company or other financial institution, in which case both signatures on behalf of the authority may be facsimile.  Interest coupons, if any, shall bear the facsimile signature of one of the persons signing the bond on behalf of the authority.  Bonds shall also bear the seal of the authority or a facsimile of the seal.  Bonds executed as provided in this paragraph shall be valid notwithstanding that any or all of the persons whose signatures appear on the bond shall have ceased to hold office before delivery of and payment for the bond.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Any bonds issued under this chapter may be issued pursuant to and entitled to the benefits of a security document between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, or by a security document directly between the authority and the purchasers of the bonds.  Such security document shall be in such form and executed in such manner as may be determined by the board.  Such security document may include the mortgage, pledge, or grant of a security interest in any property of the authority and may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues held or to be received by the authority, any contract or other rights to receive the revenues, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the authority, and any proceeds thereof.  Such security documents may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may, in the discretion of the board, be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.  Such security documents may include provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event of defaults, which may include the acceleration of maturities and the enforcement of any mortgage, pledge or security interest, and covenants setting forth the duties of, and limitations on, the authority in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of moneys, the issue of additional or refunding bonds, the fixing, revision and collection of fees and other revenues, the use of bond proceeds, the establishment of reserves, the acquisition of any property or interest therein or undertaking of any project, any contracts relating thereto and subsequent amendments of such provisions and contracts.  It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company to act as a depository or trustee of the proceeds of bonds, revenues, or other moneys under a security document and to furnish such indemnification or to pledge such securities and issue such letters or lines of credit or credit facilities as may be required by the authority acting under the paragraph.  Any such security document may set forth the rights and remedies of bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. Any bonds issued under authority of this chapter may be issued pursuant to lines of credit or other banking arrangements under such terms and conditions not inconsistent with this chapter, and under such agreements with the purchasers or makers thereof, as the board may determine to be in the best interests of the authority.  In addition to other security provided herein or otherwise by law, bonds issued by the authority under this section may be secured, in whole or in part, by insurance or by letters or lines of credit or other credit facilities issued to the authority by any bank, trust company or other financial institution, within or without the state, and the authority may make any pledge, mortgage, assignment or security interest in respect of its property and revenues as security for the reimbursement by the authority to the issuers of such letters or lines of credit, insurance or credit facilities, or any payments made thereunder.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. Any mortgage, pledge or security interest made by the authority under this chapter shall be valid and binding and shall be deemed continuously perfected for the purposes of RSA 382-A and all other laws from the time when the mortgage, pledge, or security interest is made.  The property or revenues so mortgaged, pledged, or subjected to a security interest then held or thereafter acquired or received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such mortgage, pledge, or security interest without any physical delivery or segregation thereof or further act.  The lien of such mortgage, pledge, or security interest shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.  No such property or revenues may be used in a manner inconsistent with the terms governing such mortgage, pledge, or security interest.  Any agreement by which a pledge or security interest in personal property is created under this chapter shall be filed or recorded in the records of the secretary of state.  Any mortgage or other agreement by which a security interest in real property is created under this chapter shall be filed with the register of deeds for the county in which such property is located.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. Any owner of a bond issued under the provisions of this section and any trustee under a security document securing the same, except to the extent the rights given in this paragraph may be restricted by such security document, may bring suit upon the bonds and may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding for legal or equitable relief, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state granted hereunder or under such security document, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this chapter or by such security document to be performed by the authority or by any director or officer of the authority.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. The authority may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any bonds issued under the provisions of this section at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption.  Refunding bonds may be issued at such times prior to the maturity or redemption of the bonds being refunded as the board may determine.  The refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issue of the refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming the bonds being refunded, and such reserves for debt service or other expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by a security document securing the bonds.  The authorization and issue of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties and, obligations of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as the same may be applicable.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. Any debt service fund or debt service reserve fund established in connection with the issuance of bonds under this chapter shall be kept separate from other moneys of the authority.  All proceeds of any bonds issued under this chapter, together with the income derived therefrom, shall be expended without further authorization or appropriation as provided for in the security document with respect to such bonds.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIX. Moneys in any fund or account created under the provisions of this section, subject to the terms and provisions of any security document applicable thereto, may be invested.  Except as otherwise provided by any such security document, obligations so purchased as an investment of money in said fund or account shall be deemed at all times to be part of said fund or account, and the interest thereon and any profit arising from the sale thereof shall be credited to said fund or account, and any loss resulting on their sale shall be charged to said fund or account, respectively.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX. The state does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of bonds issued under this chapter that the state shall not limit or alter the rights hereby vested in the authority to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the holders of such bonds or in any way impair the rights and remedies of such holders until such bonds, together with the interest on them, with the interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of such holders, are fully met and discharged.  The authority is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the state in any agreement with the holders of such bonds.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXI. Bonds issued under this section and their transfer and income, including any profit made on their sale or transfer, shall at all times be exempt from all taxation by or within the state.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXII. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or any recitals in any bonds issued under this section, all such bonds shall be deemed to be investment securities under RSA 382-A.">
