&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-A:11 Guarantee Fund Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In order to provide additional security to the state for any loan guarantees made under RSA 162-A:8, RSA 162-A:10, or RSA 162-A:13, there is hereby established a loan guarantee reserve fund, which shall be held by the authority apart from all of its other funds, and which shall be deemed irrevocably pledged to secure all loans guaranteed under RSA 162-A:8, RSA 162-A:10, III, or RSA 162-A:13.  Whenever a loan guarantee is awarded under RSA 162-A:8, RSA 162-A:10, III, or RSA 162-A:13 the authority, the borrower, the lending financial institution, the local development organization, the purchaser of the loans, or any appropriate combination of them shall deposit in such fund an amount equal to not less than 10 percent of the guaranteed portion of the principal of the loan or loans.  If a state guarantee is called upon to be honored, the authority, upon direction of its treasurer or assistant treasurer, shall draw upon such fund for the purpose of honoring such guarantee, and only when amounts in the fund are exhausted shall the governor be called upon to draw a warrant pursuant to RSA 162-A:8, II, RSA 162-A:10, III, or RSA 162-A:13, II.  Interest earned on amounts invested in the fund shall be accumulated therein or paid to the authority upon its direction.  If earnings are paid to the authority, they may be used by the authority for any of its purposes.  If at any time the amount in the fund exceeds 10 percent of the guaranteed portion of the principal of all loans guaranteed under this section, or such higher amount as may be determined by the authority, the authority may withdraw the excess.  Any loan guaranteed under this chapter shall be a permitted investment in this fund.  The authority may enter into such trust agreements, depository agreements, or other arrangements with one or more state banks in order to carry out the purposes of this section.
