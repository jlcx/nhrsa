&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-A:10 Secondary Market for Loans Made by Local Development Organizations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The authority may acquire for its own account, or for resale, loans made by local development organizations to businesses operating within the state.  The authority shall acquire such loans only if the local development organization agrees to use the proceeds of the sale of such loans for the promotion, encouragement, or development of business within the state, or a region or community of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Prior to the acquisition of any loans from a local development organization, the authority shall enter into a loan purchase agreement with such organization.  Such loan purchase agreement shall specify terms and conditions under which the authority will purchase loans, the purchase price for such loans, and the terms and conditions for use of the purchase price by the local development organization.  The loan purchase agreement may also contain such provisions as the authority may deem necessary or desirable, including, without limitation, representations, warranties, and covenants of the local development authority regarding the loans, conditions under which the local development authority may be required to repurchase the loans, provisions for the payment of guarantee fees to the authority in the event the loans are guaranteed under RSA 162-A:10, III, provisions for payment of the authority's costs and expenses, and provisions for the local development authority to continue servicing the loans on behalf of the authority or any subsequent purchaser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In order to facilitate the resale of loans acquired under this section the governor and council, at the request of the authority, may award a state guarantee of up to 90 percent of the principal of, interest on, and reasonable collection expenses related to such loans.  The full faith and credit of the state may be pledged for such guarantee.  In addition, the total amount guaranteed shall also include interest and related reasonable collection expenses and costs and shall not cause the contingent credit limit under RSA 162-A:22 to be exceeded.  The state's guarantee of loans under this section shall be evidenced by a guarantee agreement between the state and the purchaser of the loans.  Such guarantee agreement shall be assignable to any subsequent purchaser or purchasers of the loans and shall contain such provisions as the authority and the governor and council may deem appropriate.  Any guarantee agreement authorized in accordance with this section shall be executed on behalf of the state by the chairperson, vice chairperson, or executive director of the authority.  The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, is authorized to draw a warrant for such sum as may be necessary out of money in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of honoring any guarantee awarded under this section.  The amount of any guarantee awarded under this section shall be reduced in proportion to any reduction in the principal balance of the loan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The authority shall not purchase any loans under RSA 162-A:10, I or enter into a loan purchase agreement under RSA 162-A:10, II unless after a hearing the governor and council have made the findings specified in RSA 162-A:18.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The governor and council shall not award any state guarantee under RSA 162-A:10, III unless after a hearing they have made findings specified in RSA 162-A:18.
