<codesect>
The revenues received by and due to the authority from any and all sources under this chapter and RSA 162-I shall be retained by the authority and shall be used in such manner as may be determined by the authority consistent with the provisions of this chapter.  The authority may expend said funds in connection with transactions and projects consummated or reasonably expected to be consummated under the provisions of this chapter and RSA 162-I as it shall determine in its sole discretion.  It is the intent of the legislature that the authority be self-funding and that payment of its operating expenses shall not require state appropriation.
