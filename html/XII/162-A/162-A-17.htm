&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-A:17 State Bond Guarantee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In view of the general public benefits expected to be derived from the authority's activities under this chapter, and their contribution to the social welfare and economic prosperity of the state and its political subdivisions, the governor and council may award an unconditional state guarantee of the principal and interest thereon of bonds issued under this chapter.  The full faith and credit of the state shall be pledged for any such guarantees of principal and interest, but the total outstanding amount of bonds guaranteed by the state under this section shall not exceed in the aggregate at any time $25,000,000 plus interest.  In addition, the state shall not award a guarantee under this section if it would cause the contingent credit limit under RSA 162-A:22 to be exceeded.  The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, is authorized to draw a warrant for such a sum out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of honoring any guarantee awarded under this section.  The state's guarantee shall be evidenced on each guaranteed bond by an endorsement signed by the state treasurer in substantially the following form:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The state of New Hampshire hereby unconditionally guarantees the payment of the whole of the principal and interest thereon of the within bond, and for the performance of such guarantee the full faith and credit of the state are pledged.

II. No state guarantee shall be awarded under this section unless the guaranteed bonds are secured by, among other things, any and all fees to be received by the authority in connection with bonds issued under RSA 162-I in an original principal amount equal to or greater than $1,500,000.  In connection with the award of a state guarantee, the governor and council may impose such other terms and conditions as they may deem appropriate concerning the bonds, the use of any property or revenues of the authority, and reimbursement to the state if any state funds are used to honor the guarantee.  Such terms and conditions may be contained in an agreement between the state and the authority, to be executed on behalf of the state by the governor and the state treasurer and on behalf of the authority by its chairperson, vice chairperson, or executive director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Before awarding any state guarantee of bonds under this section the governor and council, after a hearing, shall have made the following findings:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The award of the state guarantee will contribute significantly to the success of the bond issue and the authority's programs under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Reasonable and appropriate measures have been taken to minimize the risk of loss to the state and to ensure that any private benefit from the award of the guarantee shall be only incidental to the public purpose served thereby.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The signature of the state treasurer on an endorsement of a state guarantee may be manual or facsimile.
