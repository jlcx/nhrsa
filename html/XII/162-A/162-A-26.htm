&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-A:26 Conflicts of Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any person or entity acting as an independent contractor for the authority shall avoid any conflict of interest.  No person or entity employed or retained by the authority as an independent contractor shall, while so employed or retained, represent any interest before the authority other than those of the authority and the state.  Any independent contractor who acts in a manner contrary to this section shall be dismissed by the authority unless such independent contractor takes prompt steps to eliminate any conflict of interest after receipt of notice from the authority that such a conflict exists.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the authority from requiring any borrower to pay or reimburse the authority for the fees and expenses of any independent contractor in connection with the borrower obtaining assistance from the authority.  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, an independent contractor may, with the written consent of the authority, represent a party other than the authority in connection with the issuance of bonds under RSA 162-I, provided the principal amount of the bond issue is not greater than $20,000,000.
