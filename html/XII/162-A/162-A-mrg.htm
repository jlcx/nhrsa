&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-A:11 Guarantee Fund Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In order to provide additional security to the state for any loan guarantees made under RSA 162-A:8, RSA 162-A:10, or RSA 162-A:13, there is hereby established a loan guarantee reserve fund, which shall be held by the authority apart from all of its other funds, and which shall be deemed irrevocably pledged to secure all loans guaranteed under RSA 162-A:8, RSA 162-A:10, III, or RSA 162-A:13.  Whenever a loan guarantee is awarded under RSA 162-A:8, RSA 162-A:10, III, or RSA 162-A:13 the authority, the borrower, the lending financial institution, the local development organization, the purchaser of the loans, or any appropriate combination of them shall deposit in such fund an amount equal to not less than 10 percent of the guaranteed portion of the principal of the loan or loans.  If a state guarantee is called upon to be honored, the authority, upon direction of its treasurer or assistant treasurer, shall draw upon such fund for the purpose of honoring such guarantee, and only when amounts in the fund are exhausted shall the governor be called upon to draw a warrant pursuant to RSA 162-A:8, II, RSA 162-A:10, III, or RSA 162-A:13, II.  Interest earned on amounts invested in the fund shall be accumulated therein or paid to the authority upon its direction.  If earnings are paid to the authority, they may be used by the authority for any of its purposes.  If at any time the amount in the fund exceeds 10 percent of the guaranteed portion of the principal of all loans guaranteed under this section, or such higher amount as may be determined by the authority, the authority may withdraw the excess.  Any loan guaranteed under this chapter shall be a permitted investment in this fund.  The authority may enter into such trust agreements, depository agreements, or other arrangements with one or more state banks in order to carry out the purposes of this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amount of the authority's contribution to a CAP fund shall not exceed 10 percent of the principal amount of the CAP loans to be secured by the CAP fund.  As a condition of the authority making a contribution to a CAP fund, the authority may require the borrower or the participating state bank or state credit union to make a contribution to the CAP fund and may impose such other conditions or requirements as the authority may deem necessary or desirable.  All moneys contributed to a CAP fund shall be held in the name of the authority.  Investment earnings on the CAP fund shall be credited to the fund, and such earnings shall be periodically paid to the authority unless the CAP participation agreement otherwise provides.
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Provision for the payment of authority fees, costs, and expenses from earnings on the CAP fund or otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(j) Permitted investments in the CAP fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Other terms and conditions as the authority may deem necessary or desirable.

(2) The total outstanding principal amount of CAP loans to the borrower does not exceed $500,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The proceeds of the CAP loan shall be used for business purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The authority may from time to time impose requirements on CAP loans in addition to those contained in subparagraph (a) or in a CAP participation agreement by written notice to participating state banks and state credit unions, but such additional requirements shall not apply to CAP loans already made, or to CAP loans for which written commitments exist, provided CAP loans from these written commitments are made within 3 months of the date of the written notice.  Such notices shall not constitute rules within the meaning of RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The authority shall not initially fund any CAP fund or enter into a CAP participation agreement or any material amendment to a CAP participation agreement, unless after a hearing the governor and council have made the findings specified in RSA 162-A:18.

Such state guarantee shall not at any time exceed 75 percent of the maximum principal amount that may be borrowed under the terms of the loan, plus interest and related reasonable collection expenses with respect to such loan.  For purposes of this section, the term "loan'' shall include, but not be limited to, revolving credit arrangements that provide for advances and repayment of principal based on the quality and amount of certain assets of a borrower, including rights to receive payments under contracts to provide services or products.  The full faith and credit of the state shall be pledged for any such guarantee;  provided that the guarantee shall not cause the contingent credit limit of RSA 162-A:22 to be exceeded.
<br>

III. Any loan guaranteed under this section shall meet the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The agreement establishing the loan shall provide for adequate monitoring of collateral by the lender in accord with reasonable commercial practices;  provided, however, that for loans the maximum principal amount of which may not exceed $500,000, the authority may provide alternative monitoring measures that reduce the costs of monitoring the loan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the principal amount that may be borrowed under the loan may vary based on the quality and amount of specific assets of the borrower, then the repayment of the loan shall be secured by a first priority security interest in such specific assets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the principal amount that may be borrowed under the loan may vary based on the quality and amount of specific assets of the borrower, then the agreement establishing the loan shall provide that the maximum amount of principal that may be advanced shall not exceed:

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-A:15 Issuance of Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The authority may issue bonds pursuant to this section which shall be obligations of the authority and not general obligations of the state, except as provided in RSA 162-A:17.  Such bonds may be issued from time to time consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter to make expenditures in aid of local development organizations under RSA 162-A:7, to make temporary loans to businesses under RSA 162-A:9, to acquire loans under RSA 162-A:10, to fund the guarantee fund established under RSA 162-A:11, to make contributions to CAP funds under RSA 162-A:12, to pay or refund any bonds issued pursuant to this section or interest thereon, or to pay the costs and expenses of the authority.  The principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all bonds shall be payable solely by the authority in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  The bonds shall be issued by the authority in such amounts as the board shall determine, not exceeding in the aggregate at any time $25,000,000.  Bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker's loan rate or other method as may be determined by the authority, and shall mature at such time or times as may be determined by the authority, except that no bonds shall mature more than 30 years from their date of issue.  Bonds may be made redeemable before maturity either at the option of the authority or at the option of the holder, or upon the occurrence of specified events, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds.  The authority shall determine the form and details of the bond.  The bonds may be sold in such manner, either at public or private sale, for such price, at such rate or rates of interest, or at such discount in lieu of interest as the authority may determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every bond shall be signed on behalf of the authority by 2 persons designated by the authority.  One person shall be a member of the board who is also the chairperson of the board, or the vice chairperson of the board, or the treasurer of the authority, or an assistant treasurer of the authority.  The other person shall be any member of the board or the executive director of the authority.  The signatures may be manual or facsimile but at least one signature on every bond shall be manual, unless the bond bears a manual authentication or certification by a bank, trust company or other financial institution, in which case both signatures on behalf of the authority may be facsimile.  Interest coupons, if any, shall bear the facsimile signature of one of the persons signing the bond on behalf of the authority.  Bonds shall also bear the seal of the authority or a facsimile of the seal.  Bonds executed as provided in this paragraph shall be valid notwithstanding that any or all of the persons whose signatures appear on the bond shall have ceased to hold office before delivery of and payment for the bond.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any bonds issued under this chapter may be issued pursuant to and entitled to the benefits of a security document between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, or by a security document directly between the authority and the purchasers of the bonds.  Such security document shall be in such form and executed in such manner as may be determined by the board.  Such security document may include the mortgage, pledge, or grant of a security interest in any property of the authority and may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues held or to be received by the authority, any contract or other rights to receive the revenues, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the authority, and any proceeds thereof.  Such security documents may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may, in the discretion of the board, be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.  Such security documents may include provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event of defaults, which may include the acceleration of maturities and the enforcement of any mortgage, pledge or security interest, and covenants setting forth the duties of, and limitations on, the authority in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of moneys, the issue of additional or refunding bonds, the fixing, revision and collection of fees and other revenues, the use of bond proceeds, the establishment of reserves, the acquisition of any property or interest therein or undertaking of any project, any contracts relating thereto and subsequent amendments of such provisions and contracts.  It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company to act as a depository or trustee of the proceeds of bonds, revenues, or other moneys under a security document and to furnish such indemnification or to pledge such securities and issue such letters or lines of credit or credit facilities as may be required by the authority acting under the paragraph.  Any such security document may set forth the rights and remedies of bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any bonds issued under authority of this chapter may be issued pursuant to lines of credit or other banking arrangements under such terms and conditions not inconsistent with this chapter, and under such agreements with the purchasers or makers thereof, as the board may determine to be in the best interests of the authority.  In addition to other security provided herein or otherwise by law, bonds issued by the authority under this section may be secured, in whole or in part, by insurance or by letters or lines of credit or other credit facilities issued to the authority by any bank, trust company or other financial institution, within or without the state, and the authority may make any pledge, mortgage, assignment or security interest in respect of its property and revenues as security for the reimbursement by the authority to the issuers of such letters or lines of credit, insurance or credit facilities, or any payments made thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any mortgage, pledge or security interest made by the authority under this chapter shall be valid and binding and shall be deemed continuously perfected for the purposes of RSA 382-A and all other laws from the time when the mortgage, pledge, or security interest is made.  The property or revenues so mortgaged, pledged, or subjected to a security interest then held or thereafter acquired or received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such mortgage, pledge, or security interest without any physical delivery or segregation thereof or further act.  The lien of such mortgage, pledge, or security interest shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.  No such property or revenues may be used in a manner inconsistent with the terms governing such mortgage, pledge, or security interest.  Any agreement by which a pledge or security interest in personal property is created under this chapter shall be filed or recorded in the records of the secretary of state.  Any mortgage or other agreement by which a security interest in real property is created under this chapter shall be filed with the register of deeds for the county in which such property is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any owner of a bond issued under the provisions of this section and any trustee under a security document securing the same, except to the extent the rights given in this paragraph may be restricted by such security document, may bring suit upon the bonds and may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding for legal or equitable relief, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state granted hereunder or under such security document, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this chapter or by such security document to be performed by the authority or by any director or officer of the authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The authority may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any bonds issued under the provisions of this section at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption.  Refunding bonds may be issued at such times prior to the maturity or redemption of the bonds being refunded as the board may determine.  The refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issue of the refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming the bonds being refunded, and such reserves for debt service or other expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by a security document securing the bonds.  The authorization and issue of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties and, obligations of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as the same may be applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any debt service fund or debt service reserve fund established in connection with the issuance of bonds under this chapter shall be kept separate from other moneys of the authority.  All proceeds of any bonds issued under this chapter, together with the income derived therefrom, shall be expended without further authorization or appropriation as provided for in the security document with respect to such bonds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Moneys in any fund or account created under the provisions of this section, subject to the terms and provisions of any security document applicable thereto, may be invested.  Except as otherwise provided by any such security document, obligations so purchased as an investment of money in said fund or account shall be deemed at all times to be part of said fund or account, and the interest thereon and any profit arising from the sale thereof shall be credited to said fund or account, and any loss resulting on their sale shall be charged to said fund or account, respectively.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The state does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of bonds issued under this chapter that the state shall not limit or alter the rights hereby vested in the authority to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the holders of such bonds or in any way impair the rights and remedies of such holders until such bonds, together with the interest on them, with the interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of such holders, are fully met and discharged.  The authority is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the state in any agreement with the holders of such bonds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Bonds issued under this section and their transfer and income, including any profit made on their sale or transfer, shall at all times be exempt from all taxation by or within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or any recitals in any bonds issued under this section, all such bonds shall be deemed to be investment securities under RSA 382-A.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In view of the general public benefits expected to be derived from the authority's activities under this chapter, and their contribution to the social welfare and economic prosperity of the state and its political subdivisions, the governor and council may award an unconditional state guarantee of the principal and interest thereon of bonds issued under this chapter.  The full faith and credit of the state shall be pledged for any such guarantees of principal and interest, but the total outstanding amount of bonds guaranteed by the state under this section shall not exceed in the aggregate at any time $25,000,000 plus interest.  In addition, the state shall not award a guarantee under this section if it would cause the contingent credit limit under RSA 162-A:22 to be exceeded.  The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, is authorized to draw a warrant for such a sum out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of honoring any guarantee awarded under this section.  The state's guarantee shall be evidenced on each guaranteed bond by an endorsement signed by the state treasurer in substantially the following form:

In connection with the award of a state guarantee, the governor and council may impose such other terms and conditions as they may deem appropriate concerning the bonds, the use of any property or revenues of the authority, and reimbursement to the state if any state funds are used to honor the guarantee.  Such terms and conditions may be contained in an agreement between the state and the authority, to be executed on behalf of the state by the governor and the state treasurer and on behalf of the authority by its chairperson, vice chairperson, or executive director.
<br>
