&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 168-A:4 Remedies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The superior court has jurisdiction of a proceeding under this chapter and all remedies for the enforcement of judgments for expenses of pregnancy and confinement for a mother or for education or necessary support of children apply including, but not limited to, the provisions of RSA 161-B, 161-C, and 458.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In any proceeding concerning the support of children:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The parties shall certify in the initial pleading filed with the court whether or not public assistance is or was paid for the benefit of the children pursuant to RSA 167 and whether or not medical assistance is being provided for the benefit of the children pursuant to RSA 167.  If public assistance is or was being provided or if medical assistance is being provided, the initiating party shall provide the department of health and human services, office of child support enforcement services, with copies of any and all pleadings related to medical and child support.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If, during the pendency of the action, the children become the beneficiaries of public or medical assistance, both parties shall notify the court of the public or medical assistance status of the children and shall provide the department of health and human services with copies of all pleadings related to medical and child support.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When notified that public or medical assistance is being provided for the benefit of the children, the court shall provide the office of child support with a copy of any hearing notice pertaining to any medical or child support proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The department shall be granted leave to reopen any case to modify, clarify, or vacate any order that was entered against its interest when an assignment of rights pursuant to RSA 161 or RSA 167 is or was in effect and the department was not given notice of the proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the prayer of the petitioner the court shall schedule an immediate hearing, as in the cases of prayers for temporary relief in divorce and legal separation proceedings, on the issue of whether, and how much, the alleged father of the child in question shall be required to post in advance as security for the payment of maternity and other expenses for which he may ultimately be held liable under this chapter.  The court has continuing jurisdiction to modify or revoke a judgment for future education and necessary support.  All remedies under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and all remedies included but not limited to the provisions contained in RSA 161-B, 161-C and 458 are available for enforcement of duties of support under this chapter.
