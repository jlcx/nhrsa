<center><h3>Section 155-D:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-D:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act provides funds to the states for the development of a comprehensive energy conservation plan.  The goal of each plan is to reduce energy consumption in participating states by 5 percent of projected 1980 consumption.  State plans are required to include certain mandatory measures, 2 of which are the adoption of statewide thermal and lighting standards for new and renovated buildings and lighting standards for existing buildings.  This chapter is a key part of New Hampshire's effort to formulate and implement a response to those requirements.  This chapter also establishes the framework for future response to changes in federal energy conservation requirements and advances in energy conservation requirements and energy conservation technology.
