<codesect>
Except for excavation sites of operating stationary manufacturing plants, any excavated area of 5 contiguous acres or more, which is depleted of commercial earth materials, excluding bedrock, or any excavation from which earth materials of sufficient weight or volume to be commercially useful have not been removed for a 2-year period, shall be reclaimed in accordance with RSA 155-E:5, within 12 months following such depletion or 2-year non-use, regardless of whether other excavation is occurring on adjacent land in contiguous ownership.  Each operator, other than the operator of stationary manufacturing plants which are exempt from permit requirements pursuant to RSA 155-E:2, III, shall prepare and submit for the regulator's record a reclamation plan for the affected land, including a timetable for reclamation of the depleted areas within the reclamation site.
