&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to enhanced penalties in paragraphs II and III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is a misdemeanor if a person willfully causes physical injury to a service animal or willfully allows his or her animal to cause physical injury to a service animal.  If the physical injury to a service animal is severe enough that a veterinarian or service animal trainer determines that the service animal is incapable of returning to service, that person shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In any case where a person is convicted of harming a service animal as described in paragraph II, he or she may be ordered by the court to make restitution to the person or agency owning the animal for any bills for veterinary care, the replacement cost of the animal if it is incapable of returning to service, and the salary of the service animal handler or trainer for the period of time his or her services are lost to the agency or self employment.
