&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-H:1 Declaration of Purpose.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The legislature recognizes that the selection of sites for energy facilities may have significant impacts on and benefits to the following:  the welfare of the population, private property, the location and growth of industry, the overall economic growth of the state, the environment of the state, historic sites, aesthetics, air and water quality, the use of natural resources, and public health and safety.  Accordingly, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to maintain a balance among those potential significant impacts and benefits in decisions about the siting, construction, and operation of energy facilities in New Hampshire;  that undue delay in the construction of new energy facilities be avoided;  that full and timely consideration of environmental consequences be provided;  that all entities planning to construct facilities in the state be required to provide full and complete disclosure to the public of such plans;  and that the state ensure that the construction and operation of energy facilities is treated as a significant aspect of land-use planning in which all environmental, economic, and technical issues are resolved in an integrated fashion.  In furtherance of these objectives, the legislature hereby establishes a procedure for the review, approval, monitoring, and enforcement of compliance in the planning, siting, construction, and operation of energy facilities.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Receive proposals or permit requests within the agency's permitting or other regulatory authority, expertise, or both;  determine completeness of elements required for such agency's permitting or other programs;  and report on such issues to the committee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Review proposals or permit requests and submit recommended draft permit terms and conditions to the committee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Identify issues of concern on the proposal or permit request or notify the committee that the application raises no issues of concern;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When issues of concern are identified by the agency or committee, designate one or more witnesses to appear before the committee at a hearing to provide input and answer questions of parties and committee members;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If the committee intends to impose certificate conditions that are different than those proposed by state agencies having permitting or other regulatory authority, the committee shall promptly notify the agency or agencies in writing to seek confirmation that such conditions or rulings are in conformity with the laws and regulations applicable to the project and state whether the conditions or rulings are appropriate in light of the agency's statutory responsibilities.  The notified state agencies shall respond to the committee's request for confirmation as soon as possible, but no later than 10 calendar days from the date the agency or agencies receive the notification described above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When initiating a proceeding for a committee matter, the committee shall expeditiously notify state agencies having permitting or other regulatory authority or that are identified in administrative rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 30 days of receipt of a notification of proceeding, a state agency not having permitting or other regulatory authority but wishing to participate in the proceeding shall advise the presiding officer of the committee in writing of such desire and be allowed to do so provided that the presiding officer determines that a material interest in the proceeding is demonstrated and such participation conforms with the normal procedural rules of the committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner or director of each state agency that intends to participate in a committee proceeding shall advise the presiding officer of the name of the individual on the agency's staff designated to be the agency liaison for the proceeding.  The presiding officer may request the attendance of an agency's designated liaison at a session of the committee if that person could materially assist the committee in its examination or consideration of a matter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All communications between the committee and agencies regarding a pending committee matter shall be included in the official record and be publicly available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A state agency may intervene as a party in any committee proceeding in the same manner as other persons under RSA 541-A.  An intervening agency shall have the right to rehearing and appeal of a certificate or other decision of the committee.
