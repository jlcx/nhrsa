<center><h3>Section 162-H:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-H:1 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The legislature recognizes that the selection of sites for energy facilities, including the routing of high voltage transmission lines and energy transmission pipelines, will have a significant impact upon the welfare of the population, the location and growth of industry, the overall economic growth of the state, the environment of the state, and the use of natural resources.  Accordingly, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to maintain a balance between the environment and the need for new energy facilities in New Hampshire;  that undue delay in the construction of needed facilities be avoided and that full and timely consideration of environmental consequences be provided;  that all entities planning to construct facilities in the state be required to provide full and complete disclosure to the public of such plans;  and that the state ensure that the construction and operation of energy facilities is treated as a significant aspect of land-use planning in which all environmental, economic, and technical issues are resolved in an integrated fashion, all to assure that the state has an adequate and reliable supply of energy in conformance with sound environmental principles.  The legislature, therefore, hereby establishes a procedure for the review, approval, monitoring, and enforcement of compliance in the planning, siting, construction, and operation of energy facilities.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The committee shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Determine the terms and conditions of any certificate issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Monitor the construction and operation of any energy facility granted a certificate under this chapter.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The committee shall hold hearings as required by this chapter and such additional hearings as it deems necessary and appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The committee may delegate the authority to monitor the construction or operation of any energy facility granted a certificate under this chapter to such state agency or official represented on the committee as it deems appropriate, but, subject to RSA 162-H:10, it may not delegate authority to hold hearings, issue certificates, determine the terms and conditions of a certificate, or enforce a certificate.  Any authorized representative or delegate of the committee shall have a right of entry onto the premises of any part of the energy facility to ascertain if the facility is being constructed or operated in continuing compliance with the terms and conditions of the certificate.  During normal hours of business administration and on the premises of the facility, such a representative or delegate shall also have a right to inspect such records of the certificate-holder as are relevant to the terms or conditions of the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. The committee may delegate to an agency or official represented on the committee the authority to specify the use of any technique, methodology, practice, or procedure approved by the committee within a certificate issued under this chapter, or the authority to specify minor changes in the route alignment to the extent that such changes are authorized by the certificate for those portions of a proposed electric transmission line or energy transmission pipeline for which information was unavailable due to conditions which could not have been reasonably anticipated prior to the issuance of the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In cases where the committee determines that other existing statutes provide adequate protection of the objectives of RSA 162-H:1, the committee may, within 60 days of acceptance of the application, or filing of a request for exemption with sufficient information to enable the committee to determine whether the proposal meets the requirements set forth below, and after holding a public informational hearing in a county where the energy facility is proposed, exempt the applicant from the approval and certificate provisions of this chapter, provided that the following requirements are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Existing state or federal statutes, state or federal agency rules or municipal ordinances provide adequate protection of the objectives of RSA 162-H:1;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A review of the application or request for exemption reveals that consideration of the proposal by only selected agencies represented on the committee is required and that the objectives of RSA 162-H:1 can be met by those agencies without exercising the provisions of RSA 162-H;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Response to the application or request for exemption from the general public indicates that the objectives of RSA 162-H:1 are met through the individual review processes of the participating agencies;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) All environmental impacts or effects are adequately regulated by other federal, state, or local statutes, rules, or ordinances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The subcommittee shall include the chairperson or the vice-chairperson of the committee, and at least 3 members selected from among the department of environmental services, the department of resources and economic development, and the fish and game department.  With the exception of the chairperson or vice-chairperson, each member of the committee may designate an employee from his or her agency to assume his or her responsibilities as a subcommittee member for the purposes of this paragraph, provided that such designee shall be a senior administrator within the agency, department, or division that the member represents under RSA 162-H:3.  The chairperson may designate the assistant commissioner of the department of environmental services to assume his or her responsibilities as a subcommittee member for the purposes of this paragraph.  For purposes of statutory interpretation and executing the regulatory functions of this chapter, the subcommittee shall assume the role of and be considered the committee, with all of its associated powers and duties.
