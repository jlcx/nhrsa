The legislature recognizes that the selection of sites for energy facilities may have significant impacts on and benefits to the following:  the welfare of the population, private property, the location and growth of industry, the overall economic growth of the state, the environment of the state, historic sites, aesthetics, air and water quality, the use of natural resources, and public health and safety.  Accordingly, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to maintain a balance among those potential significant impacts and benefits in decisions about the siting, construction, and operation of energy facilities in New Hampshire;  that undue delay in the construction of new energy facilities be avoided;  that full and timely consideration of environmental consequences be provided;  that all entities planning to construct facilities in the state be required to provide full and complete disclosure to the public of such plans;  and that the state ensure that the construction and operation of energy facilities is treated as a significant aspect of land-use planning in which all environmental, economic, and technical issues are resolved in an integrated fashion.  In furtherance of these objectives, the legislature hereby establishes a procedure for the review, approval, monitoring, and enforcement of compliance in the planning, siting, construction, and operation of energy facilities.
