<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established in the office of the state treasurer a nonlapsing, special fund to be known as the site evaluation committee fund.  All application fees and other filing fees received by the committee under 162-H:8-a shall be deposited in the fund.  All moneys in the fund shall be continually appropriated to the site evaluation committee and shall only be used, except as provided in paragraph III, to pay for compensation and reimbursements made under RSA 162-H:22 for energy facility proceeding time and expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All other operating costs of the committee, including, but not limited to, administrator and other committee support costs under RSA 162-H:3-a and public member compensation and reimbursements that are not paid from the site evaluation committee fund pursuant to paragraph I, except those costs paid by applicants under RSA 162-H:10, shall be funded through appropriations from the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the fiscal biennium ending June 30, 2019, if the funds available to the committee to pay the operating costs specified in paragraph I or II are insufficient to permit the committee to pay all such operating costs, then upon request of the committee and approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, the shortfall shall be funded through a transfer from the renewable energy fund established in RSA 362-F:10 to the site evaluation committee fund in an amount not to exceed $480,000.  Any amount transferred but not expended for such shortfall during the 2018-2019 biennium shall lapse back to the renewable energy fund at the end of the biennium.
