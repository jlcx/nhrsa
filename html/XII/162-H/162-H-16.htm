I. The committee shall incorporate in any certificate such terms and conditions as may be specified to the committee by any of the other state agencies having jurisdiction, under state or federal law, to regulate any aspect of the construction or operation of the proposed facility;  provided, however, the committee shall not issue any certificate under this chapter if any of the other state agencies denies authorization for the proposed activity over which it has jurisdiction.  The denial of any such authorization shall be based on the record and explained in reasonable detail by the denying agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any certificate issued by the site evaluation committee shall be based on the record.  The decision to issue a certificate in its final form or to deny an application once it has been accepted shall be made by a majority of the full membership.  A certificate shall be conclusive on all questions of siting, land use, air and water quality.

III. The committee may consult with interested regional agencies and agencies of border states in the consideration of certificates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The site evaluation committee, after having considered available alternatives and fully reviewed the environmental impact of the site or route, and other relevant factors bearing on whether the objectives of this chapter would be best served by the issuance of the certificate, must find that the site and facility:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Applicant has adequate financial, technical, and managerial capability to assure construction and operation of the facility in continuing compliance with the terms and conditions of the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Will not unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region with due consideration having been given to the views of municipal and regional planning commissions and municipal governing bodies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The committee may condition the certificate upon the results of required federal and state agency studies whose study period exceeds the application period.
