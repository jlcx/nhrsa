&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Within 30 days after acceptance of an application for a certificate of site and facility, pursuant to RSA 162-H:7, the site evaluation committee shall hold at least one joint public hearing in each county in which the proposed facility is to be located and shall publish a public notice not less than 14 days before said hearing in one or more newspapers having a regular circulation in the county in which the hearing is to be held, describing the nature and location of the proposed facilities.  The public hearings shall be joint hearings, with representatives of the other agencies that have jurisdiction over the subject matter and shall be deemed to satisfy all initial requirements for public hearings under statutes requiring permits relative to environmental impact.  The hearings shall be for public information on the proposed facilities with the applicant presenting the information to the site evaluation committee and to the public.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the hearing shall be a joint hearing with the other state agencies and shall be in lieu of all hearings otherwise required by any of the other state agencies;  provided, however, if any of such other state agencies does not otherwise have authority to conduct hearings, it may not join in the hearing under this chapter;  provided further, however, the ability or inability of any of the other state agencies to join shall not affect the composition of the committee under RSA 162-H:3 nor the ability of any member of the committee to act in accordance with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except for informational hearings, subsequent hearings shall be in the nature of adjudicative proceedings under RSA 541-A and may be held in the county or one of the counties in which the proposed facility is to be located or in Concord, New Hampshire, as determined by the site evaluation committee.  The committee shall give adequate public notice of the time and place of each subsequent session.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The site evaluation committee shall consider and weigh all evidence presented at public hearings and shall consider and weigh written information and reports submitted to it by members of the public before, during, and subsequent to public hearings.  The committee shall grant free access to records and reports in its files to members of the public during normal working hours and shall permit copies of such records and reports to be made by interested members of the public at their expense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The site evaluation committee shall require from the applicant whatever information it deems necessary to assist in the conduct of the hearings, and any investigation or studies it may undertake, and in the determination of the terms and conditions of any certificate under consideration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The site evaluation committee and counsel for the public shall jointly conduct such reasonable studies and investigations as they deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter and may employ a consultant or consultants, legal counsel and other staff in furtherance of the duties imposed by this chapter, the cost of which shall be borne by the applicant in such amount as may be approved by the committee.  The site evaluation committee and counsel for the public are further authorized to assess the applicant for all travel and related expenses associated with the processing of an application under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The site evaluation committee shall issue such rules to administer this chapter, pursuant to RSA 541-A, after public notice and hearing, as may from time to time be required.
