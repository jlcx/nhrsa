&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon notification that an application for a certificate has been filed with the committee in accordance with RSA 162-H:7, the attorney general shall appoint an assistant attorney general as a counsel for the public.  The counsel shall represent the public in seeking to protect the quality of the environment and in seeking to assure an adequate supply of energy.  The counsel shall be accorded all the rights and privileges, and responsibilities of an attorney representing a party in formal action and shall serve until the decision to issue or deny a certificate is final.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This section shall not be construed to prevent any person from being heard or represented by counsel;  provided, however, the committee may compel consolidation of representation for such persons as have, in the committee's reasonable judgment, substantially identical interests.
