Upon written request, the department shall provide the parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities with a statement of the costs of any services, placements, or programs incurred in the case to date.  The parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities shall promptly notify the department of any insurance benefits that may be available to pay for all or a portion of the services provided.  Upon receipt of notice of a proposed service, the parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities shall contact their insurance carrier within 48 hours to determine if coverage is available to pay for the particular service and shall notify the department of the results.  If insurance coverage is available, the parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities shall cooperate with the insurance carrier and shall comply with the insurance carrier's requirements for direct payment to the provider.

Such financial statement shall include, but not be limited to, any benefits received from the Social Security Administration or insurance benefits available to the individual.  The court shall include disposition of these benefits in its order as to reimbursement.

Upon the issuance of the order in paragraph I, the court shall send notice to the state.  The state may, within 30 days from receipt of notice, request a hearing on the issues of the cost or appropriateness of services, or recovery.  At such hearing, the court shall provide all financial information, including names and addresses of persons chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities, to the state.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The office of reimbursements acting on behalf of Laconia developmental services and the New Hampshire hospital is authorized to compromise or reduce any expense to be charged to the state.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. The department may enter into an agreement with a county to collect, on behalf of the department, payments from persons or entities which are ordered to reimburse the state under paragraph I, or which are chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities.
