I. After a legally sufficient petition has been filed, the court shall, unless the case is referred to diversion or a consent order is entered and approved, schedule an initial appearance, and issue a summons including a copy of the petition, to be served personally upon the person having custody or control of the child or with whom the child may be, requiring that person to appear with the child on the specified date and time.  If personal service is not possible, service shall occur at the usual place of abode of the person having custody or control of the child or with whom the child may be, requiring that person to appear with the child at a specified place and time which time shall not be less than 24 hours after service.  If the person so notified is not the parent or guardian of the child, then a parent or guardian shall be notified, provided they and their residence are known, or if there is neither parent nor guardian, or their residence is not known, then some relative, if there be one and the residence is known.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A copy of the petition shall be attached to each summons or incorporated therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
