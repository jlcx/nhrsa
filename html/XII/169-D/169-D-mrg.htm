<center><h3>Section 169-D:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-D:1 Applicability of Chapter;  Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
This chapter shall apply to children in need of services as hereinafter defined and shall be construed and administered in accordance with the following purposes and policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To recognize that certain behaviors occurring within a family or school environment indicate that a child is experiencing serious difficulties and is in need of services and corrective action in order to protect the child from the irreversibility of certain choices, and to protect the integrity of the family and the authority it must maintain in order to fulfill its responsibilities to raise the next generation.  To further provide the child with the treatment, care, guidance, counseling, discipline, supervision, and rehabilitation necessary to assist him in becoming a responsible and productive member of society;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To recognize that we must no longer bring the weight of family problems down on the child alone but that parents must be made aware of their contribution to the problem and must account for their role in the solution of the problem, and must accept the responsibility to participate in any program of care ordered by the court in order to assure that the outcome may have a good probability of success while, at the same time, supporting families in their mission to teach values to youth and to exercise reasonable control of their children;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To keep a child, whenever possible, in contact with his home community and in a family environment by preserving and strengthening the unity of the family and separating the child from his parents only when it is clearly necessary for his welfare or the interests of public safety, and when it can be clearly shown that a change in custody and control will benefit the child;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. To protect the integrity of the family by authorizing adjudication and the imposition of dispositional judgment requiring participation in a plan of services or by offering appropriate voluntary alternatives;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. To provide effective judicial procedures through which family service plans are executed and enforced, and which assure the parties fair hearings at which their constitutional and other rights as citizens are recognized and protected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-D:5 Petition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) A petition alleging that a child is in need of services under RSA 169-D:2, II(a) may be filed by a truant officer or school official from the school district where the child is attending school with a judge or clerk of the court in the judicial district where the child is found or resides.  In accordance with RSA 189:36, II, a truant officer or school official shall not file a petition alleging that a child is in need of services under RSA 169-D:2, II(a) until all steps in the school district's intervention process under RSA 189:34, II have been followed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A petition alleging that a child is in need of services under RSA 169-D:2, II(b) or RSA 169-D:2, II(c) may be filed by a parent, legal guardian or custodian, school official, or law enforcement officer with a judge or clerk of the court in the judicial district in which the child is found or resides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A petition alleging that a child is in need of services under RSA 169-D:2, II(d) may, with the consent of the department, be filed by a parent, legal guardian or custodian, school official, or law enforcement officer with a judge or clerk of the court in the judicial district in which the child is found or resides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The petition shall be in writing and verified under oath.  The following notice shall be printed on the front of the petition in bold in no smaller than 14 point font size:  "See back for important information and financial obligations.''  The back of the petition shall include a notice of liability for parents and other individuals chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities, which shall state:  "In accordance with RSA 169-D:29, parents and others chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities are required to reimburse the state for the cost of voluntary or court ordered services.  The amount that you will be required to reimburse the state will be based on your ability to pay.  You have a right, upon written request, to receive a statement from the department of the cost of services incurred in the case to date.  Upon our receipt of notice of a proposed service or placement, you must contact your insurance carrier within 48 hours to see if coverage is available to pay for the proposed service or placement and notify the department of the results.  If insurance coverage is available, you must cooperate with your insurance carrier and comply with their requirements for direct payment to the provider.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To be legally sufficient, the petition must set forth with particularity, but not be limited to, the date, time, manner and place of the conduct alleged and should state the statutory provision alleged to have been violated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Any petition filed shall include language demonstrating whether appropriate voluntary services have been attempted, the nature of voluntary services attempted, and the reason court compulsion is necessary.  The petition also shall include information regarding the department's determination as to whether voluntary services are appropriate for the child or family under RSA 169-D:5-c.  Refusal of the child to participate in the development of a voluntary services plan may constitute sufficient information that voluntary service and support options have been unsuccessful.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the parents of a child are filing the petition, they shall include information which shows that the child and family have sought to resolve the expressed problem through available community alternatives, that the problem still remains, and that court intervention is needed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as provided in paragraph VI, when a school official is filing the petition, information shall be included which shows that the legally liable school district has sought to resolve the expressed problem through available educational approaches, that the school district has sought to engage the parents or guardian in solving the problem but they have been unwilling or unable to do so;  that the problem remains, and that court intervention is needed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When a school official is filing a petition involving a child with a disability pursuant to RSA 186-C, he or she shall include information which demonstrates that the legally liable school district:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Has determined that the child has a disability;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Has reviewed for appropriateness the child's current individualized education program (IEP) and placement, and has made modifications where appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Using local law enforcement personnel, the court shall serve both parents, and any other individual chargeable by law for the child's support, with a copy of any petition filed under this section.  The court shall request the appropriate contact information from the party filing the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The department shall develop a brochure that describes the liability and reimbursement process under RSA 169-D:29.  The brochure shall be available to the public and shall be distributed at the earliest available opportunity to parents and others chargeable by law for the minor's support who are requesting or receiving voluntary or court ordered services.  The brochure shall contain a description of the liability and reimbursement process under RSA 169-D:29, examples of typical services that may be provided through voluntary or court ordered services, the cost or range of costs for these services, and a statement that although the court may order reimbursement pursuant to RSA 169-D:29, any reimbursement order will be based on the person's ability to pay.  The department shall provide its juvenile probation and parole officers with information and training on the liability and reimbursement requirements of this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-D:5-c Voluntary Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department shall assess whether to offer the child and family, on a voluntary basis, any services permitted under RSA 169-D:17 except out-of-home placement of the child.  The department may decline to offer services to a child or family if it concludes that the child does not meet the definition of child in need of services in RSA 169-D:2, II, or if the department otherwise determines that voluntary services are not appropriate for the child or family.  The department shall document the basis for its decision.  Notwithstanding RSA 541-A, the department's decision shall not be subject to appeal, nor shall the fact that the department declined to offer voluntary services preclude a person from filing a petition under RSA 169-D:5, I.  Voluntary services provided under this section shall not exceed 9 months, unless the department determines that an extension for an additional, specified period of time is appropriate.

I. (a) After a legally sufficient petition has been filed, unless the case is referred to the department pursuant to RSA 169-D:5 or a consent order is entered and approved, the court shall schedule an initial appearance and issue a summons, including a copy of the petition, to be served personally upon the person having custody or control of the child or with whom the child may be, requiring that person to appear with the child on the specified date and time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If personal service is not possible, service shall occur at the usual place of abode of the person having custody or control of the child or with whom the child may be, requiring that person to appear with the child at a specified place and time which time shall not be less than 24 hours after service.  If the person so notified is not the parent or guardian of the child, then a parent or guardian shall be notified, provided they and their residence are known.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-D:9 Pre-adjudicatory Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except in emergencies, the department, its agent, or any person or agency it designates shall determine whether voluntary service options are appropriate for the child and family.  A referral for this determination may be made by any person permitted to bring a petition under RSA 169-D:5, I.  To achieve this purpose, the department may designate a multi-disciplinary team to consider the facts and circumstances of the case, the needs of the child and family, and available diversion programs, services, and resources.  This conference shall be attended by the child, if appropriate, his or her parents, legal guardians or custodians, and representatives of any public institution or agency having legal responsibility over the child, and may be attended by parties invited by the family and representatives of any public or private institutions or agencies having discretionary ability to coordinate and/or supply services to the child or family.  If the child does not attend a multi-disciplinary conference, an appropriate individual shall be designated to solicit the child's input and help the child understand available service options and supports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If available, a multi-disciplinary conference may be held at any time before or after a petition is filed but shall be held before the child's initial appearance pursuant to RSA 169-D:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At any time before or after a petition is filed, the child, his or her caretakers, and the department may effect an individualized voluntary family services plan, which shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Identification of the circumstances which contributed to the need for services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A description of the services that are needed for the child, the child's caretakers, or other family members, the availability of such services within the community, and a plan for ensuring that any such services that are available will be secured and provided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The name of the person within each affected public service agency who is directly responsible for assuring that specific services identified in the plan are provided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An estimate of the time anticipated to be necessary to accomplish the goals set out in the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any other provisions deemed appropriate by the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Designation of a responsible person or agency for oversight of the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A voluntary family services plan shall set forth in writing the terms and conditions agreed to by the child, the child's caretaker, and all parties responsible for implementation of the voluntary services plan.  A written copy of the plan shall be submitted to each party or person responsible for implementation of the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A voluntary services plan may be amended by agreement of the parties at any time.  If a petition has been filed, the amended plan shall be submitted to the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a petition has been filed and the department determines voluntary services are appropriate, a voluntary family services plan shall be submitted to the court.  The voluntary services plan shall stay the proceedings for a period not to exceed 90 days from the date of implementation, unless the parties agree, in writing, to an extension for additional periods not to exceed 90 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. When the petitioning person or agency, the court, the department, or a member of the multi-disciplinary team suspects that a child has a disability, an administrator at the responsible school district shall be notified.

IX. Any incriminating statement made by the child during discussions or conferences incident to the voluntary family services plan shall not be used against the child, over objection, in adjudicatory hearing pursuant to RSA 169-B or 169-D, or a criminal trial.  Any such statement may be reported as the basis for a referral to the department pursuant to RSA 169-C, if there is reasonable basis to believe that a child's physical or mental health or welfare is endangered by abuse or neglect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A voluntary family services plan suspends the proceedings on the petition.  If the child satisfies the terms of the voluntary family services plan, he or she shall be discharged from further services or supervision, and the pending complaint or petition shall be dismissed with prejudice.

I-a. A record of the adjudicatory hearing shall be preserved unless expressly waived in writing by the parties, and parties shall be notified in writing of their right to appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Following the initial appearance the court shall proceed to hear the case in accordance with the due process rights afforded a child alleged to be in need of services.  The prosecution shall present witnesses to testify in support of the petition and any other evidence necessary to support the petition.  The child shall have the right to present evidence and witnesses on his behalf and to cross-examine adverse witnesses.  The provisions of RSA 613:3, I, relative to the summoning of out-of-state witnesses, shall apply to the proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the court finds the child is in need of services, it shall, unless a report done on the same child less than 3 months previously is on file, order the department of health and human services or other appropriate agency to make an investigation and written report consisting of, but not limited to, the home conditions, school record and the mental, physical and social history of the child including sibling relationships and residences for the purpose of preserving relationships between siblings who are separated as a result of court ordered placement.  Evaluations performed at the Philbrook center may occur only upon receiving prior approval for such evaluation from the commissioner of the department of health and human services or designee.  When ordered by the court, such investigation shall include a physical and mental examination of the child, parents, guardian, or person having custody.  The court may order a substance abuse evaluation of the child, parents, guardian, or person having custody.  Any substance abuse evaluation of the parent, guardian, or person having custody of the child shall be conducted by a provider contracted with the bureau of substance abuse services, or a provider paid by the parent, guardian, or person having custody of the child.  The cost of said evaluation shall be paid by private insurance, if available, or otherwise by the person undergoing the evaluation, to whom the evaluation shall be provided free or at a reduced cost if the person is of limited means.  The court shall inform the parents, guardian, or person having custody and child of their right to object to the physical examination, mental health evaluation, or substance abuse evaluation.  Objections shall be submitted in writing to the court having jurisdiction within 5 business days after notification of the time and place of the examination or evaluation.  The court may excuse the child, parents, guardian, or person having custody upon good cause shown.  No disposition order shall be made by the court without first reviewing the investigation report, if ordered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court shall share the report with the parties.  The report will be used only after a finding that the child is in need of services and will be used only as a guide for the court in determining an appropriate disposition for the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court shall hold a final dispositional hearing within 30 days of the adjudicatory hearing unless continued for good cause.  No dispositional hearing for a child placed outside the child's home may be continued more than once for good cause or for a period longer than 14 days, except by agreement of all the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Whenever a court contemplates a placement which will require educational services outside the child's home school district, the court shall notify the school district and give the district the opportunity to send a representative to the hearing at which such placement is contemplated.  In cases where immediate court action is required to protect the health or safety of the child or of the community, the court may act without providing for an appearance by the school district, but shall make reasonable efforts to solicit and consider input from the school district before making a placement decision.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), where the petition alleges that the child is a habitual truant under RSA 169-D:2, II(a), that the child repeatedly disregards the reasonable and lawful commands of his or her parents, guardian, or custodian under RSA 169-D:2, II(b), or that the child repeatedly or habitually engages in conduct that constitutes violation level offenses under RSA 169-D:2, II(c), the court shall not order the out-of-home placement of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Imposing a fine or restitution, or both, on a child who has committed an offense which, if committed by an adult, would be a violation under the criminal code of this state;  or has committed an offense which, if committed by a person 16 years of age or older, would be a violation under the motor vehicle code of this state;  or has violated an ordinance or bylaw of a city or town.  Such fine shall not exceed the fine which may be imposed against an adult for the same offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Ordering the minor to perform up to 50 hours of uncompensated public service subject to the approval of the elected or appointed official authorized to give approval of the city or town in which the offense occurred.

However, no person who performs such public service under this subparagraph shall receive any benefits that such employer gives to its other employees, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation and unemployment benefits and no such employer shall be liable for any damages sustained by a person while performing such public service or any damages caused by that person unless the employer is guilty of gross negligence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Requiring any child to attend structured after-school or evening programs which address some of the child's compliance issues, as well as supervise the child during the time of the day in which the child most values his or her freedom and the time which is most often used to perform unruly acts.  The cost of said programs shall be paid by private insurance, if available, or otherwise by the child, parent, guardian, or person having custody of the child, or may be available to the child free of charge based on the limited means of the family or based on the program's receipt of other funding.  Payment shall be made pursuant to RSA 169-D:29 only for those programs that have been certified pursuant to RSA 170-G:4, XVIII.
<br>

The other options for a permanency plan include termination of parental rights or parental surrender when an adoption is contemplated, guardianship with a fit and willing relative or another appropriate party, or another planned permanent living arrangement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-b. When a dispositional order places a minor in an out-of-home placement pursuant to RSA 169-B:19, I(e) or (f), prior to concluding the dispositional hearing the court shall set a date for a permanency hearing pursuant to RSA 169-D:21-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The court may order the child or the family or both to undergo physical treatment or treatment by a mental health center or any other psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric social worker or family therapist as determined by the court.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the judge orders services, placements, or programs different from the recommendations of the department, the judge shall include a statement of the costs of the services, placements, and programs so ordered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Prior to any placement which will require educational services outside the child's home school district, the court shall notify the school district and give the district the opportunity to send a representative to the hearing at which such placement is contemplated.  At such hearing the court shall consider the recommendations of the school district and if such an out-of-district placement is ordered the court shall make written findings that describe the reasons for the placement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-D:18 Disposition of Child With a Disability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any point during the proceedings, the court may, either on its own motion or that of any other person, and if the court contemplates a residential placement, the court shall immediately, join the legally liable school district for the limited purposes of directing the school district to determine whether the child is a child with a disability as defined in RSA 186-C or of directing the school district to review the services offered or provided under RSA 186-C if the child has already been determined to be a child with a disability.  If the court orders the school district to determine whether the minor is a child with a disability, the school district shall make this determination by treating the order as the equivalent of a referral by the child's parent for special education, and shall conduct any team meetings or evaluations that are required under law when a school district receives a referral by a child's parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Once joined as a party, the legally liable school district shall have full access to all records maintained by the district court under this chapter.  The school district shall also report to the court its determination of whether the minor is a child with a disability, and the basis for such determination.  If the child is determined to be a child with a disability, the school district shall make a recommendation to the court as to where the child's educational needs can be met in accordance with state or federal education laws.  In cases where the court does not follow the school district's recommendation, the court shall issue written findings explaining why the recommendation was not followed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the school district finds or has found that the child is a child with a disability, or if it is found that the child is a child with a disability on appeal from the school district's decision in accordance with the due process procedures of RSA 186-C, the school district shall offer an appropriate educational program and placement in accordance with RSA 186-C.  Financial liability for such educational program shall be as determined in RSA 186-C:19-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In an administrative due process hearing conducted by the department of education pursuant to RSA 186-C, a school district may provide a hearing officer with information from district court records which the school district has accessed pursuant to paragraph II of this section, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At least 20 days prior to providing any records to the hearing officer, the school district files notice of its intention to do so with the court and all parties to the proceedings, and no party objects to the release of records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The notice filed by a school district under this provision shall include, on a separate sheet of paper, the following statement in bold typeface:  "Persons subject to juvenile proceedings have important rights to the confidentiality of juvenile court proceedings.  This notice requests the disclosure of some of that information.  If you object to the disclosure of information, you must file a written objection with the court no later than 10 days after the filing of the school district's notice.  If you fail to object in writing, the court may allow private information to be revealed to the New Hampshire Department of Education hearing officer.'';  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any objection by a party shall be filed with the court no later than 10 days after the filing of the school district's notice with the court, unless such time is extended by the court for good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court may, on its own initiative and no later than 13 days after the filing of the school district's notice to the court, issue an order directing the school district to show cause why the information should be disclosed to the hearing officer.  Upon receipt of an objection or issuance of a show cause order, the court shall schedule an expedited hearing on the matter to determine if the requested records may be released.  The court may rule without a hearing if the school district and a parent or legal guardian or the juvenile, if he or she has reached the age of majority, agree in writing to waive a hearing.  Upon the filing of an objection or show cause order, the school district may file a reply explaining why the school district believes that the information should be disclosed to the hearing officer.  In determining whether to authorize the disclosure of the information requested by the school district, the court shall balance the importance of disclosure of the records to a fair and accurate determination of the merits against the privacy interests of the parties to the proceedings, and render a written decision setting forth its findings and rulings.  No information released to a hearing officer pursuant to this paragraph shall be disclosed to any other person or entity without the written permission of the court, the child's parent or legal guardian, or the juvenile if he or she has reached the age of majority, except that a court conducting an appellate review of an administrative due process hearing shall have access to the same information released to a hearing officer pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-D:18-a Determination of Competence. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any point during the proceedings, the court may, either on its own motion or that of any of the parties, order the child to submit to a mental health evaluation for the purpose of determining whether the child is competent to have committed the offenses or acts alleged in the petition.  The evaluation shall be completed within 60 days of the date of such order and shall be conducted by an agency other than the Philbrook center which is approved by the commissioner of health and human services, or conducted by a psychologist licensed in New Hampshire or a qualified psychiatrist, or by the Philbrook center only upon receiving prior approval for admission of the child for such evaluation by the commissioner of the department of health and human services.  The evaluation shall be submitted to the court in writing prior to the hearing on the merits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court shall inform the child of his right to object to the evaluation;  if he does object, he shall do so in writing to the court within 5 days of the court's order for the evaluation.  The court shall hold a hearing to consider the objection, and may, for good cause, excuse the child from the evaluation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever such an evaluation has been made previously for consideration at a prior proceeding, it shall be jointly reviewed by the court and the evaluating agency before the case is heard.  The evaluator shall keep records of having conducted the evaluation, but no reports or records shall be made available, other than to the court and parties, except upon the written consent of the child or his legal representative, parent or guardian or pursuant to RSA 169-B:35.  The expense of such evaluation is to be borne as provided in RSA 169-B:40.

For a child who enters an out-of-home placement subsequent to an adjudicatory finding and who is in an out-of-home placement for 12 or more months, the court shall hold and complete an initial permanency hearing within 12 months of the child's entry into out-of-home placement.  For a child who is in out-of-home placement following the initial permanency hearing, the court shall hold and complete a subsequent permanency hearing within 12 months of the initial permanency hearing and every 12 months thereafter as long as the child is in an out-of-home placement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At a permanency hearing the court shall consider whether the parent or parents and child have met the responsibilities pursuant to the dispositional orders issued by the court.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-D:29 Liability of Expenses and Hearing on Liability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a)(1) When an order creating liability for expenses is issued by the court under this chapter or when a voluntary service plan is developed and provided for a minor and the minor's family by the department, any expenses incurred for services, placements, and programs the providers of which are certified pursuant to RSA 170-G:4, XVIII, shall be payable by the department of health and human services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) When an order creating liability for expenses is issued by the court under this chapter or when a voluntary service plan is developed and provided for a minor, any expenses incurred for approved diversion services shall be paid by the parent or guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subparagraph (a) shall not apply to expenses incurred for special education and related services, or to expenses incurred for evaluation, care, and treatment of the child at the Philbrook center or to expenses incurred for the cost of accompanied transportation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The state shall have a right of action over for such expenses against the parents or the people chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities.  Upon written request, the department shall provide the parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities with a statement of the costs of any services, placements, or programs incurred in the case to date.  The parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities shall promptly notify the department of any insurance benefits that may be available to pay for all or a portion of the services provided.  Upon receipt of notice of a proposed service, the parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities shall contact their insurance carrier within 48 hours to determine if coverage is available to pay for the particular service and shall notify the department of the results.  If insurance coverage is available, the parents or other persons chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities shall cooperate with the insurance carrier and shall comply with the insurance carrier's requirements for direct payment to the provider.  The court shall require the individual chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities to submit a financial statement annually to the court upon which the court shall make an order as to reimbursement to the state as may be reasonable and just, based on the person's ability to pay.  Such financial statement shall include, but not be limited to, any benefits received from the Social Security Administration or insurance benefits available to the individual.  The court shall include disposition of these benefits in its order as to reimbursement.  Such reimbursement shall be established on a per month or per week basis and shall continue from the time the services begin until 4 years beyond the time such services end, unless such reimbursement is fully paid prior to the end of the 4-year period.  The court's jurisdiction to order reimbursement shall continue until the court-ordered obligation to reimburse has been fulfilled.  If the court does not issue a reimbursement order, the court shall issue written findings explaining why such reimbursement is not ordered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Liability for placement expenses for any court ordered placement of any minor mother under this chapter shall include liability for placement expenses for the child or children of such minor mother if the minor mother and child or children are placed at the same facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Payments due under this section for the care of children in foster homes shall commence within 60 days of the child's placement in the foster home and shall be made every 30 days thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the issuance of the order in paragraph I, the court shall send notice to the state.  The state may, within 30 days from receipt of notice, request a hearing on the issues of the cost or appropriateness of services, or recovery.  At such hearing, the court shall provide all financial information, including names and addresses of persons chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities, to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The office of reimbursements acting on behalf of Laconia developmental services and the New Hampshire hospital is authorized to compromise or reduce any expense to be charged to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department may enter into an agreement with a county to collect, on behalf of the department, payments from persons or entities which are ordered to reimburse the state under paragraph I, or which are chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities.  An agreement may authorize the county to deduct reasonable administrative costs from the amounts collected.  The balance of any amounts collected by the county pursuant to this paragraph shall be forwarded to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the person responsible for paying reimbursements to the department under paragraph IV is financially able to pay such reimbursements but fails to make such payments, the department may apply to the district court for a lien on such person's real or personal property for the amount of reimbursements due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon request by the adoptive parent of a child whose birth parents relinquished their parental rights to the department or the parental rights of whose birth parents were terminated pursuant to a petition brought by the department, the state, acting through the commissioner, may waive its right of action against such adoptive parent for all or a portion of the expenses of services, placements, and programs provided pursuant to RSA 169-B, 169-C or 169-D after the adoption.  The department shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A to establish the procedure to be followed to obtain a waiver of parental reimbursement pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For the adoptive parent or prospective adoptive parent of a child in the custody of the state whose birth parents have consented to the adoption, relinquished their parental rights to the department, or the parental rights of whose birth parents were terminated pursuant to a petition brought by the department, authorized agency, or foster parent, pursuant to RSA 170-C:4, the state shall waive its right of action against such adoptive parent or prospective adoptive parent for the expenses of services, placements, and programs provided pursuant to RSA 169-B, 169-C, or 169-D after the adoption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the department determines that the adoptive parent has been convicted of sexual or physical abuse of the adopted child pursuant to RSA 631 or 632-A, or the adoptive parent has misappropriated adoption subsidy moneys, the adoptive parent shall be responsible for payment for subsequent services, placements, and programs provided pursuant to RSA 169-B, 169-C, or 169-D after the adoption.  A determination of misappropriation is subject to the provisions of RSA 126-A:5, VIII.
