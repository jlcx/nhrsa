<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Permanency hearing'' means a court hearing for a minor in an out-of-home placement to review, modify, and/or implement the permanency plan or adopt the concurrent plan.
<br>

Shelter care facilities may be utilized for children prior to or following adjudication or disposition.
