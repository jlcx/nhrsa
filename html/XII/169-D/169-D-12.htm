(a) The parent, guardian, or custodian did not file the petition;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Both the child and parent, guardian, or custodian agree to waive counsel;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the court's opinion, the waiver is made competently, voluntarily, and with full understanding of the consequences.
