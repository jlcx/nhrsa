&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All places where the business of serving food to the public is conducted shall be equipped with toilet and lavatory facilities convenient of access for the use of patrons.  Separate toilet rooms for each sex shall be provided for patrons of any restaurant designed to seat 25 or more patrons at one time or for patrons of any food establishment where alcoholic beverages are served.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall have the authority to waive the requirements of this section for such businesses having 5 or fewer seats, for good cause shown, provided the business is unable to comply with this section because it does not have toilet or lavatory facilities on the effective date of this section as amended, and can show that the requirements of this section would cause substantial hardship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The provisions of this section shall not apply to mobile lunch carts or be construed to require roadside stands or so-called drive-ins, serving food to the public, to provide toilet facilities for patrons where seating facilities within the building are not available.
