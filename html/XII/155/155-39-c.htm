&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155:39-c Existing Facilities;  Public Accommodations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Nothing in RSA 155:39-b related to equal access to public accommodations or indirectly denying access to the physically disabled shall apply to existing structures, structures under construction or proposed construction submitted for bid before January 1, 1991.  For any building or facility proposed to be constructed specifically as a place of public accommodation on or after January 1, 1991, but before January 1, 1992, the following standards of construction shall be met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There shall be at least one public walk not less than 48 inches wide with a slope not greater than one foot rise in 12 feet leading directly to a primary entrance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There shall be a door at such primary entrance with a clear opening of no less than 32 inches and operable by a single effort.  If doors at a primary entrance are in a series, they shall have a space between them of not less than 84 inches measured from their closed positions, and each shall open in the same direction so that swings do not conflict.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Rest room facilities shall have at least one stall that is not less than 5 feet wide and 5 feet in depth with a 32-inch wide door that swings out or slides, handrails on each side mounted 30 inches from the floor, and a water closet with a seat 18 inches high.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Doors that are not intended for normal use, and that are dangerous if a blind person were to enter or exit by them, shall be made identifiable to touch by knurling the handle or knob.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In any building designed and constructed specifically for public accommodations, the bathroom facilities and all accompanying fixtures shall be arranged to permit access and use by a person in a wheelchair in at least 5 percent of the living units, or at least one living unit, whichever is greater.  Such units shall be constructed on ground level and shall comply with paragraph III of this section.
