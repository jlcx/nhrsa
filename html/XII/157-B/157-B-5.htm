&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Subsequent to the inspection of an elevator or accessibility lift, an inspector shall file with the commissioner an inspection report on a form prescribed by the commissioner indicating whether or not the elevator or accessibility lift is certifiable and shall provide a copy of the inspection report to the owner or the owner's designee.  When an elevator or accessibility lift passes inspection, the commissioner shall furnish an inspection certificate to its owner or the owner's designee on a form prescribed by the commissioner.  A fee of $50 shall be charged for each certificate.  If the fee is not paid within 30 days of the date on which the certificate is issued, the certificate shall be void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the elevator or accessibility lift fails the inspection, the inspector shall furnish the owner or the owner's designee an appropriate abstract of the statutory requirements and recommendations for repairs necessary to correct the deficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon compliance with the recommendations of an inspector, whether by repair or replacement, the owner of an elevator or accessibility lift which has failed to pass inspection, or the owner's designee, shall notify the commissioner and inspector that the required repairs have been completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The elevator or accessibility lift shall, at the discretion of the inspector or the commissioner, then be reinspected in accordance with this section;  and, upon finding compliance with the recommendations, an inspection certificate shall be furnished to the owner or the owner's designee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Certificates shall be posted in the elevator car or accessibility lift platform under glass or other suitable transparent cover.  Certificates shall be effective for one year from the date of inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. An owner who permits the operation of any elevator or accessibility lift without an effective inspection certificate in the elevator or accessibility lift shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person.
