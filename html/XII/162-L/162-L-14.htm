<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Hold at least one public hearing to obtain the views of citizens on community development, to furnish the citizens with information concerning the amount of funds available and the range of community development activities that may be undertaken under this subdivision and to give affected citizens an opportunity to examine a proposed statement to the projected use of such funds to be applied for.  A notice of the hearing shall specify the grounds for the hearing as well as the date, time, and place.  This notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, and a legal notice shall also be posted in at least 3 public places within such municipality at least 10 days prior to the hearing.  The 10 days shall not include the day of publication or the day of posting, whichever is later, nor the day of the hearing, but shall include any Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays within the period.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The chief executive officer shall certify that the municipality will comply with the provisions of this subdivision and with other applicable federal and state laws and rules as may be determined by the authority and the federal government.
