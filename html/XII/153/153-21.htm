The state fire marshal or his authorized officers may at all reasonable hours enter any building or premises, at the request of any fire chief, for the purpose of making an inspection or investigation which, under the provisions hereof, he may deem necessary to be made.  If the owner or occupant refuses to permit such inspection, the state fire marshal or his authorized officers may, if they have reasonable suspicion of the violation of the provisions hereof or of any rule or regulation of the state fire marshal or of any local law or ordinance pertaining to fire prevention, apply under oath for the issuance of a search warrant as provided in RSA 595, and such warrant may issue upon a showing of just cause.
