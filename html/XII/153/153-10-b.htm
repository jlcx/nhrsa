&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 153:10-b Fire Protection and Warning Devices in Health Care Facilities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All health care facilities shall be provided with the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An automatic or manually operated fire alarm system approved by the state fire marshal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A non-battery operated smoke detection system or unit approved by the state fire marshal in all corridors and stairwells of hospitals and an additional non-battery operated smoke detector in each bedroom of nursing homes and hospices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An automatic water sprinkler system approved by the state fire marshal in all hazardous areas such as kitchens and laundries, but not limited to these areas, in all health care facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state fire marshal may grant exceptions or require alternative measures to paragraph I that achieve equivalent protection.  The state fire marshal's written orders under this paragraph shall be complied with not later than 180 days following issuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The operation of any fire protection or warning device shall automatically, without delay, accomplish the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) General alarm condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Control functions required to be performed by the device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Transmit an alarm automatically to the fire department which is legally committed to serve the area in which the health care facility is located, by the most direct and reliable method approved by the local fire authority and the state fire marshal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A remote, constantly attended location that will receive all fire alarm signals may be substituted for fire alarm notification to the fire department if approved by the state fire marshal.  In this case, an immediate, direct method of manual fire alarm shall be available for fire department notification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All designs of fire protection and warning devices for health care facilities shall be reviewed by the state fire marshal to determine compliance with the requirements of RSA 153:10-b, and no device shall be installed until it has been approved by the state fire marshal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The state fire marshal shall determine the adequacy of fire warning protection in each health care facility on an individual basis.  The state fire marshal shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A to be included in the state fire code to implement the purposes of this section.  Authority under this section is in addition to and not a diminution of the authority of the state fire marshal as provided in RSA 153:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The state fire marshal may delegate his authority to insure compliance with the provisions of this section and may delegate the inspections of premises to any legal fire authority in any city, town, or precinct.  If any local ordinance or bylaw or any rule adopted by a state agency contains more stringent requirements than the provisions of this section, the more stringent requirements shall be controlling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any party aggrieved by the state fire marshal's interpretation, order, requirements, or direction under the provisions of this section may, within 45 days after the service of notice, appeal to the supreme court under RSA 541.
