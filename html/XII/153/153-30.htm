&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 153:30 Expiration and Renewal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Licenses shall be renewed as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Except for licenses issued pursuant to RSA 153:29-a, all licenses shall expire every 2 years on the last day of the month of the holders birth.  The board shall renew a valid license issued under this subdivision on receipt of an application for renewal and the required fee before the expiration date of the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a person or business entity fails to renew a license prior to expiration, the person or business entity may have the license reinstated within 365 days of its expiration by paying the late fee in addition to the renewal fee.  A late fee is not required during the first 30 days of expiration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except for licenses issued pursuant to RSA 153:29-a, any application received 365 days or more after the expiration of the license shall be rejected unless accompanied by proof of successful completion of the examination required under RSA 153:29 subsequent to its expiration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Except for applications received pursuant to RSA 153:29-a, applicants for license renewal shall provide to the board evidence of completion of continuing education within the previous 24-month period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the request of a licensed fuel gas fitter or licensed plumber who is a member of any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States or the national guard and is called to active duty, the board shall place the person's license on inactive status.  The license may be reactivated within one year of the licensee's discharge by payment of the renewal fee and with proof of completion of the most current continuing education requirement unless still within the renewal period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board shall assess a reinstatement fee for any individual or business entity license upon completion of a suspension or revocation period resulting from disciplinary action pursuant to RSA 153:32, IV.
