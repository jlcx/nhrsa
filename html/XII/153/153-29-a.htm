<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may issue a business entity a fuel gas fitter license without examination or continuing education requirements to corporations, partnerships, or limited liability companies engaged in fuel gas fitting, provided one or more officers of the corporation, or designee, or one or more members of the partnership, or designee, or one or more managing members of the limited liability company, or designee, hold an active and current license as a liquefied propane service technician or natural gas service technician under this subdivision.  Within 30 days after the death or withdrawal of the licensed person as a corporate officer, or designee, or member of the partnership, or designee, or one or more managing members of the limited liability company, or designee, the licensed person, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company shall give notice thereof to the commissioner and, if no other officer, partner, manager or designee, is licensed as a liquefied propane service technician or natural gas service technician, the corporation, or partnership, or limited liability company shall not act as a fuel gas fitter until some other officer, member, or designee, has obtained a license as a liquefied propane service technician or natural gas service technician.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner shall not require a fee for a corporation engaged in fuel gas fitting where a licensed liquefied propane service technician or natural gas service technician is the sole shareholder of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All licenses issued under this section shall expire every 2 years on the last day of December.  The commissioner shall renew a valid license issued under this section on receipt of an application for renewal and the required fee before the expiration date of the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the application and renewal procedure and any eligibility requirements in addition to those in this subdivision for a fuel gas fitter license for business entities issued pursuant to this section.
