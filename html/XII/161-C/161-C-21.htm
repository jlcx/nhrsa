&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person employing a person owing a support debt shall honor a duly executed assignment of earnings presented by the commissioner.  This requirement to honor the assignment of earnings itself shall be applicable whether the earnings are to be paid presently or in the future and shall continue in force until released in writing by the commissioner.  Payment pursuant to an assignment of earnings presented by the commissioner shall serve as full acquittance under any contract of employment, and the state warrants that it shall defend and hold harmless any person who honors the assignment of earnings for claims arising from the action taken in honoring the assignment.  The commissioner shall not be liable for improper receipt of monies under an assignment of earnings upon return of any monies so received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No employee shall be discharged by reason of any presentation of an assignment of earnings.
