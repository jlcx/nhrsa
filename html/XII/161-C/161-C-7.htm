&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When the department is subrogated to a legal order of support under RSA 161-C:6, the commissioner may issue to any responsible parent a notice of debt accrued or accruing under RSA 161-C:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The notice of debt shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A statement of the debt accrued or accruing under RSA 161-C:4;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement of the terms of the order, including the names of the dependent children;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement that any property of the debtor is subject to lien and foreclosure, administrative seizure and disposition, order to withhold and deliver, or other collection actions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A demand for payment of the support debt within 20 days of service of the notice of debt;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A statement that the net proceeds of any collection action will be applied to the satisfaction of the support debt;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A statement of the procedures available for contesting the action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Actions to collect any debt accrued or accruing under RSA 161-C:4 may commence after 20 days from the date of service of the notice of debt described in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner finds that the collection of any support debt accrued or accruing under RSA 161-C:4 is in jeopardy, the commissioner may make demand under paragraph II for immediate payment of the support debt, and upon failure or refusal immediately to pay, the commissioner may file and serve liens pursuant to RSA 161-C:10 and orders to withhold and deliver pursuant to RSA 161-C:12.  No action under RSA 161-C:13 and 14 may be taken and no demand made under RSA 161-C:12, VI until the notice requirements of paragraph II are met.
