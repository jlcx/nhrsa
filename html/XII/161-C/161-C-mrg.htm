&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-C:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Common law and statutory procedures governing the enforcement of support for dependent children by responsible parents have not proven sufficiently effective or efficient to cope with the increasing incidence of financial dependency.  It is hereby declared that the common law and statutory remedies pertaining to desertion and nonsupport of dependent children shall be augmented by additional remedies directed to the real and personal property of the responsible parents.  In order to render resources more immediately available to meet the needs of dependent children, it is the purpose of this chapter to provide additional remedies for the support of dependent children, which remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, existing law.  It is declared to be the public policy of this state that this chapter be construed and administered to the end that children shall be maintained from the resources of responsible parents, thereby relieving, at least in part, the burden presently borne by the general citizenry through welfare programs.  It is further declared to be the policy of this state that this chapter be construed and administered to the end that children shall be maintained from the resources of responsible parents, regardless of whether or not these children are recipients of public assistance.

I. An order to withhold and deliver property of any kind, including but not restricted to earnings which are due, owing or belonging to a responsible parent, may be served on any person when the commissioner has reason to believe that there is in the possession of any such person property which is due, owing or belonging to the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may serve an order to withhold and deliver when a notice of debt has been served in accordance with RSA 161-C:7, or 21 days have elapsed from the date since a decision has been served under RSA 161-C:9.  Service under this section may be made by law enforcement personnel or other agents authorized by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The order to withhold and deliver shall also be served on the responsible parent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-C:13 Distraint, Seizure and Sale of Property Subject to Liens. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever a support lien has been filed pursuant to RSA 161-C:10 the commissioner may collect the support debt stated in said lien by the distraint, seizure and sale of the property subject to said lien.  The commissioner shall serve notice to the responsible parent and any person known to have or claim an interest therein of the general description of the property to be sold and the time and place of said property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A notice specifying the property to be sold shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the county wherein the distraint has been made.  Except for good cause shown, the time of sale shall not be less than 10 nor more than 20 days from the date of posting of such notices.  In no event shall a sale of property take place under this chapter until 20 days after the responsible parent has received notice of such parent's rights to contest the proceeding.  The sale shall be conducted by the commissioner or designee who shall proceed to sell such property by parcel or by lot at a public auction, and who may set a minimum reasonable price to include the expenses of making a levy and of advertising the sale.  If the amount bid for such property at the sale is not equal to the price so fixed, the commissioner may declare such property to be purchased by the department for such price and pay off all prior mortgages and liens or may conduct another sale of such property pursuant to the provisions of this section.  In the event of sale, the responsible parent's account shall be credited with the amount for which the property has been sold after paying off prior mortgages or liens.  In lieu of any such sale, the seized property may be distributed in accordance with the rules for distribution established by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Property acquired by the department as prescribed in this section may be sold by the commissioner or designee at public or private sale and the amount realized shall be placed in an appropriate state fund to the credit of the department of health and human services.  In all cases of sale under this section, the commissioner shall issue a bill of sale or a deed to the purchaser and such bill of sale or deed shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the commissioner to make such sale and conclusive evidence of the regularity of the commissioner's proceeding in making the sale and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title and interest of the debtor in the property.  The proceeds of any such sale, except in those cases in which the property has been acquired by the department, shall be first applied by the commissioner to pay off prior mortgages or liens, then to reimbursement of the costs of distraint and sale, and thereafter in satisfaction of the delinquent account.  Any excess which shall thereafter remain in the hands of the commissioner shall be refunded to the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Distraint, seizure, and sale under this section may be carried out by law enforcement personnel and any other agents so authorized by the department.

The payment of the lien, debt, costs, and reasonable attorney fees, at any time before sale, shall satisfy the judgment of foreclosure.  Where the net proceeds of sale upon application to the debt claimed do not satisfy the debt in full, the plaintiff shall have judgment over for any deficiency remaining unsatisfied and further levy and sales upon other property of the judgment debtor may be made under the same execution.  In all sales contemplated under this section, advertising of notice shall only be necessary for 2 weeks in a newspaper of daily circulation published in the county where said property is located, and if there is no newspaper in that county, then in the most convenient newspaper having a circulation in such county.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The receipt of public assistance for a child shall constitute an assignment by the recipient to the department of any and all rights, title, and interest in and to support obligation owed to or for the recipient or, the child or children, or both the recipient and any child or children, up to the amount of public assistance money paid for or on behalf of such child or such children which accrues during the period that the public assistance is provided.  Such assignment includes only those arrearages which accrue during the period that the public assistance is provided to the family.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The recipient shall also be deemed, without the necessity of signing any document, to have appointed the commissioner as his or her attorney in fact to perform the specific act of endorsing over to the department for the support of any dependent child, any and all drafts, checks, money orders or other negotiable instruments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When an assignment of support rights has terminated and the obligor and the recipient reunite, the obligor may request a suspension of the collection of a support debt under RSA 161-C:4 and the office of child support enforcement services shall not take any action to collect such a debt for so long as the family remains reunited, provided that the adjusted gross income of the family, as defined by RSA 458-C, is equal to or less than 185 percent of the federal poverty guidelines as set by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  If collection of a support debt under RSA 161-C:4 is suspended, the obligor shall provide the office of child support enforcement services with a financial affidavit every 6 months evidencing the income of the reunited family and shall notify the office of child support enforcement services in writing within 10 days of any change in income or if the family is no longer reunited.  Failure to report changes in income or in the status of the family as reunited, or to provide a financial affidavit as specified herein, shall cause the suspension of collection to terminate until such time as the required information is submitted and provided that such information meets the criteria for obtaining a suspension of collection.  When a support obligation is established under RSA 161-C:4, the office of child support enforcement services shall notify an obligor of the right to request a suspension of the collection of a support debt.
