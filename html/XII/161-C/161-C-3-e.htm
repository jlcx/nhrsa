&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each health carrier, as defined in RSA 420-G:2, shall electronically cross-match claims data, policyholder, and subscriber information with the department of health and human services to provide health insurance coverage information, for the purpose of enforcing medical child support orders administered by the office of child support enforcement services under RSA 161-C:3-b, concerning individuals subject to an order to provide health insurance coverage for dependents administered by the office of child support enforcement services, or dependents covered by such medical support orders, in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner under RSA 161-C:28.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such electronic cross-match shall be made by any health carrier upon certification by the department that all persons identified on the electronic medium are individuals subject to an order to provide health insurance coverage for dependents administered by the office of child support enforcement services, or dependents covered by such medical support orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All information disclosed by the department for the purpose of the electronic cross-match shall remain property of the state of New Hampshire.  Any health carrier, public agency, or contracted agent engaged by the department to perform the electronic cross-match shall purge any information received from the department pursuant to this section concerning individuals or dependents from its records and databases immediately upon the completion of the data match exchange.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In any case where the department administers a medical child support order on behalf of a dependent child who does not receive temporary assistance to needy families or medical assistance, the transaction costs associated with the electronic cross-match shall be paid in advance by the custodial parent or guardian, and the non-custodial parent shall reimburse the custodial parent for such transaction costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any health carrier who supplies information in accordance with this section and with rules adopted under RSA 161-C:28 shall have immunity from any civil or criminal liability that might otherwise be imposed or incurred.
