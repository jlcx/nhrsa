&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-C:3-f Child Support Insurance Settlement Intercept. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department may provide certain information to public agencies or its contracted agents in order to intercept insurance settlement payments or judgments claimed by individuals who are subject to a child support lien pursuant to RSA 161-C and who owe past-due support.  The department may identify such individuals by name, last 4 digits of the individual's social security number or other taxpayer identification number, date of birth, last known address, employer, or any combination thereof.  Any information provided by the department in accordance with this section shall remain the property of the state of New Hampshire and shall be purged by any public agency or contracted agent receiving said information upon completion of the data match exchange.  The department may perform an audit to insure that any public agency or contracted agent has purged said information.  The specific penalty for failure to purge the information shall be set forth in any contract or agreement between the department and any public agency or contracted agent made pursuant to this section.  Any transaction cost incurred by the department related to the data match exchange shall be directly recovered by the department from any insurance settlement or judgment proceeds.  Insurance settlement payments for casualty loss to personal or real property, past or future medical treatment, and a pro-rated amount equal to 185 percent of the self-support reserve defined in RSA 458-C:2, X for the period of lost work for which the settlement or judgment constitutes recovery shall be exempt from this section.  Reasonable attorney fees and expenses related to obtaining the insurance settlement or judgment shall be exempt from this section pursuant to RSA 311:13.  Any settlement, payment, or judgment received under the provision of this section shall be held by the department for 60 days prior to its release or distribution unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
