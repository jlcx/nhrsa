<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an administrator at an area agency providing continuing services to a person conditionally discharged pursuant to RSA 171-A:22 or the administrator's designee reasonably believes that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person has violated a condition of the discharge;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A condition or behavior exists as a result of which the person may pose a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, the administrator or designee may conduct a review of the acts, behavior or condition of the person to determine if the conditional discharge shall be revoked.  The review may be conducted only after the person has been given written and verbal notice of the belief, and the reasons for such belief, that a violation of the conditional discharge has occurred or other circumstance or condition exists which may result in a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, and the person has been given an opportunity to provide information to the administrator or designee as to why the revocation should not occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the person refuses or is otherwise unavailable for the review under paragraph I, the administrator or other representative of the area agency may sign a complaint for delivery of the person for the review.  The complaint and the written notice required by paragraph I shall be provided to a law enforcement officer who shall take custody of the person and immediately deliver such person to the place specified in the complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the administrator or designee, following the review, finds that either the person has violated a condition of the discharge or a condition or behavior exists as a result of which the person may pose a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, he or she may temporarily revoke the conditional discharge.  If the conditional discharge is temporarily revoked, the administrator or designee shall inform the person affected verbally and in writing, giving the reasons for the revocation and shall identify the receiving facility to which the person is to be delivered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A law enforcement officer shall take custody of the person whose conditional discharge was temporarily revoked under paragraph II and deliver the person, together with a copy of the notice and the reasons for the temporary revocation, to the receiving facility identified by the administrator or designee where the reasons for temporary revocation of the discharge shall be reviewed.  Following such review, if the administrator of the receiving facility or designee finds that either the person conditionally discharged has violated a condition of the discharge or a condition or behavior exists as a result of which the person may pose a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, the administrator or designee may revoke absolutely the conditional discharge and shall provide to the person written and verbal notice of the reasons for the absolute revocation.  Following such revocation the person shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the order of involuntary admission from which conditional discharge was granted as if the conditional discharge had not been granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the administrator or designee performing a review under paragraph III or paragraph IV finds no basis for temporary or absolute revocation of the discharge, the person shall be returned by the program or facility which has custody of the person to the location where the person was initially taken into custody or to another location agreed to by the person.
