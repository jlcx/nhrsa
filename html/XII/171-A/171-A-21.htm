<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When any person has been involuntarily admitted to a receiving facility pursuant to RSA 171-B or conditionally discharged pursuant to paragraph II of this section, the administrator of the receiving facility most recently providing services to the person may grant an absolute discharge to the person with the consent of the chief administrator of the state developmental services system or designee who has reviewed the person's situation, provided that the chief administrator or designee determines that an absolute discharge shall not create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious likelihood of substantial damage to real property.  The administrator shall, in writing, immediately notify the court entering the original order of commitment and the attorney general that the person has been given an absolute discharge from the receiving facility.  Upon receipt of the notice, the court shall make the notice part of the person's file and shall enter the discharge and date of discharge upon the docket.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The administrator of the facility may, with prior approval of the chief administrator of the state developmental services system or designee, grant a person, whose condition is not considered appropriate for absolute discharge, a conditional discharge.
