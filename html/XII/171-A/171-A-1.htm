&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 171-A:1 Purpose and Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to enable the department of health and human services to establish, maintain, implement and coordinate a comprehensive service delivery system for developmentally disabled persons.  The policy of this state is that persons with developmental disabilities and their families be provided services that emphasize community living and programs to support individuals and families, beginning with early intervention, and that such services and programs shall be based on the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Participation of people with developmental disabilities and their families in decisions concerning necessary, desirable, and appropriate services, recognizing that they are best able to determine their own needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Services that offer comprehensive, responsive, and flexible support as individual and family needs evolve over time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Individual and family services based on full participation in the community, sharing ordinary places, developing meaningful relationships, and learning things that are useful, as well as enhancing the social and economic status of persons served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Services that are relevant to the individual's age, abilities, and life goals, including support for gainful employment that maximizes the individual's potential for self-sufficiency and independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Services based on individual choice, satisfaction, safety, and positive outcomes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Services provided by competent, appropriately trained and compensated staff.
