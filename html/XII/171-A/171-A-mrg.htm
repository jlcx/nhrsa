&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 171-A:1 Purpose and Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
 The purpose of this chapter is to enable the department of health and human services to establish, maintain, implement and coordinate a comprehensive service delivery system for developmentally disabled persons.  The policy of this state is that persons with developmental disabilities and their families be provided services that emphasize community living and programs to support individuals and families, beginning with early intervention, and that such services and programs shall be based on the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Participation of people with developmental disabilities and their families in decisions concerning necessary, desirable, and appropriate services, recognizing that they are best able to determine their own needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Services that offer comprehensive, responsive, and flexible support as individual and family needs evolve over time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Individual and family services based on full participation in the community, sharing ordinary places, developing meaningful relationships, and learning things that are useful, as well as enhancing the social and economic status of persons served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Services that are relevant to the individual's age, abilities, and life goals, including support for gainful employment that maximizes the individual's potential for self-sufficiency and independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Services based on individual choice, satisfaction, safety, and positive outcomes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Services provided by competent, appropriately trained and compensated staff.

I. When any person has been involuntarily admitted to a receiving facility pursuant to RSA 171-B or conditionally discharged pursuant to paragraph II of this section, the administrator of the receiving facility most recently providing services to the person may grant an absolute discharge to the person with the consent of the chief administrator of the state developmental services system or designee who has reviewed the person's situation, provided that the chief administrator or designee determines that an absolute discharge shall not create a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious likelihood of substantial damage to real property.  The administrator shall, in writing, immediately notify the court entering the original order of commitment and the attorney general that the person has been given an absolute discharge from the receiving facility.  Upon receipt of the notice, the court shall make the notice part of the person's file and shall enter the discharge and date of discharge upon the docket.
<br>

The administrator of the facility or designee shall prepare, deliver a copy of, and read and explain to the person being conditionally discharged a written statement in clear and understandable language of the conditions of conditional discharge and a warning that violation of those conditions may result in revocation of the conditional discharge pursuant to RSA 171-A:23.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 171-A:23 Revocation of Conditional Discharge. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an administrator at an area agency providing continuing services to a person conditionally discharged pursuant to RSA 171-A:22 or the administrator's designee reasonably believes that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person has violated a condition of the discharge;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A condition or behavior exists as a result of which the person may pose a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, the administrator or designee may conduct a review of the acts, behavior or condition of the person to determine if the conditional discharge shall be revoked.  The review may be conducted only after the person has been given written and verbal notice of the belief, and the reasons for such belief, that a violation of the conditional discharge has occurred or other circumstance or condition exists which may result in a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, and the person has been given an opportunity to provide information to the administrator or designee as to why the revocation should not occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the person refuses or is otherwise unavailable for the review under paragraph I, the administrator or other representative of the area agency may sign a complaint for delivery of the person for the review.  The complaint and the written notice required by paragraph I shall be provided to a law enforcement officer who shall take custody of the person and immediately deliver such person to the place specified in the complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the administrator or designee, following the review, finds that either the person has violated a condition of the discharge or a condition or behavior exists as a result of which the person may pose a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, he or she may temporarily revoke the conditional discharge.  If the conditional discharge is temporarily revoked, the administrator or designee shall inform the person affected verbally and in writing, giving the reasons for the revocation and shall identify the receiving facility to which the person is to be delivered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A law enforcement officer shall take custody of the person whose conditional discharge was temporarily revoked under paragraph II and deliver the person, together with a copy of the notice and the reasons for the temporary revocation, to the receiving facility identified by the administrator or designee where the reasons for temporary revocation of the discharge shall be reviewed.  Following such review, if the administrator of the receiving facility or designee finds that either the person conditionally discharged has violated a condition of the discharge or a condition or behavior exists as a result of which the person may pose a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others or a potentially serious threat of substantial damage to real property, the administrator or designee may revoke absolutely the conditional discharge and shall provide to the person written and verbal notice of the reasons for the absolute revocation.  Following such revocation the person shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the order of involuntary admission from which conditional discharge was granted as if the conditional discharge had not been granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the administrator or designee performing a review under paragraph III or paragraph IV finds no basis for temporary or absolute revocation of the discharge, the person shall be returned by the program or facility which has custody of the person to the location where the person was initially taken into custody or to another location agreed to by the person.
