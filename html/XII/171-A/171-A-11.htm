&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The needs and services of every client in the service delivery system shall be subject to a periodic review under the supervision of the administrator, which shall include but not be limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A thorough clinical examination including an annual health assessment;

(b) An assessment of the client's capacity to make informed decisions;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Consideration of less restrictive alternatives for service, particularly for those clients in residential services.

The administrator shall give written notice to the client and his or her nearest relative or legal guardian at least 10 days prior to a periodic review.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
