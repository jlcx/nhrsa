<codesect>
For the purpose of this subdivision:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Detonators'' shall mean any devices for the purpose of exploding an explosive charge and shall include blasting caps, blasting caps with safety fuse, electric blasting caps, detonating fuses, primers, boosters and igniters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Primers, percussion fuses, combination fuses and time fuses'' shall mean devices used to ignite powder charges of ammunition or the black powder bursting charges of projectiles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Explosive bombs'' shall mean containers filled with explosives and provided with a detonating device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Detonating fuse'' shall mean a fuse containing high explosives of sufficient strength to detonate other high explosives lying alongside and explode the entire charge almost instantaneously through its whole length.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Boosters'' shall mean casings containing several ounces of a high explosive used to increase the intensity of explosion of the detonator of a detonating fuse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Delay electric igniters'' shall mean small metal tubes containing a wire bridge in contact with a small quantity of ignition compound.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Blasting caps'' shall mean thin metal shells containing dry fulminate of mercury or other similar substance either alone or in combination with fulminate of mercury and fired by a slow-burning safety fuse, or arranged to be fired by an electric current.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. "Tracer fuses'' shall mean devices attached to projectiles and containing a slow-burning composition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. "Electric squibs'' shall mean small tubes or blocks containing a small quantity of ignition compound in contact with a wire bridge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. "Explosives'', "high explosive'' or "explosive substance'' shall mean any material or container containing a chemical compound or mixture that is commonly used or intended for the purpose of producing an explosion and that contains any oxidizing or combustible materials or other ingredients in such proportions, quantities, or packing that an ignition by fire, friction, concussion, or detonation of any part of the compound or mixture may cause such a sudden generation of highly heated gases that the resultant gaseous pressure is capable of producing destructive effects on contiguous objects.  This definition shall not include the components for hand loading rifle, pistol, and shotgun ammunition and or rifle, pistol, and shotgun ammunition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Infernal machine'' shall mean any device which would endanger life or do damage to property, or both, by fire or explosion, whether or not contrived to ignite or explode automatically and whether or not disguised so as to appear harmless.
