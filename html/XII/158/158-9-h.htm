&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No natural person shall conduct blasting operations without a current certificate of competency issued by the director of the division of state police and valid for the category of use involved.  Such certificate shall be valid for 4 years from the date of issue unless suspended or revoked by the director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner of the department of safety shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, establishing the categories of certificates of competency based on the use of the explosives and the procedure and criteria for issuing, renewing, suspending, and revoking such certificates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person convicted of violating the provisions of RSA 158:9-h, I, and any natural person convicted of violating RSA 158:9-h, II, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor for the first and second offense and of a felony for any subsequent offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
