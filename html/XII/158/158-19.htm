&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 158:19 Control of Explosives. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever in his judgment the common defense of public safety of the state requires such action, the governor is hereby authorized to direct the adjutant general of this state to control the storage, sale, and use of explosives, except small arms ammunition, for the purpose of preventing such explosives from endangering the public safety by coming into the possession of unfriendly forces, domestic or foreign, and for the purpose of advising the military, naval, and civil defense authorities of this state of the quantities and location of such explosives for use in the common defense of this state.  Upon the governor so directing, the adjutant general is hereby authorized to promulgate regulations requiring dealers to register their stocks and sales of such explosives, and requiring boards of firewards, police officers, or selectmen, as the case may be, to assist in such control measures as he shall institute in the exercise of this authority.  No records of the location and amounts of explosives compiled by the adjutant general hereunder shall be deemed public records, but shall be subject to such security classification and restricted to such military, naval, and civil defense uses as the adjutant general, with the approval of the governor and council, may prescribe.
