<codesect>
The superior court may enjoin any act in violation of a determination of a nuclear decommissioning financing committee, or it may require the owner or owners to comply with any determination or order of such committee.  Failure by an owner to make the payments or maintain the funding assurance required by this chapter and established by order of the committee shall create a debt owing to the state that may be collected or enforced by the attorney general in an action at law.  If any owner fails to pay any judgment ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the attorney general may levy against the property of such owner to satisfy such judgment.
