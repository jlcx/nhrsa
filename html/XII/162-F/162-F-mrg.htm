&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-F:1 Decommissioning Responsibility. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The legislature recognizes that in order to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of the public and of current and future generations, a costly and comprehensive decommissioning procedure is necessary at the end of the useful or serviceable life of nuclear electric generating facilities.  Because the costs are substantial and because these costs are the direct and predictable result of operating such a facility and should not have to be borne by the state, it is found to be in the public interest to require that adequate fiscal responsibility be established to ensure proper and safe decommissioning, and also to ensure subsequent surveillance of a nuclear reactor site to the extent necessary to prevent such sites from constituting a hazard to current or future generations.  The legislature, therefore, hereby establishes a procedure that will provide assurance of adequate funding by each owner of a facility for decommissioning.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A separate nuclear decommissioning financing fund, with a separate account for each owner, shall be established in the office of the state treasurer for each facility in the state.  The committee shall determine the projected cost of decommissioning, the funding date, and the schedule of payments sufficient to ensure that the full cost of decommissioning shall be met by the funding date.  The moneys in such fund shall not be subject to any state taxes and shall not be subject to any federal taxes to the extent allowed by applicable federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each owner shall be separately liable for its proportional share, based on its ownership interest, of the cost of decommissioning the facility.  The state shall have no financial responsibility for decommissioning, or the demolition and removal of facilities constructed as part of any uncompleted facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The committee shall establish a schedule for payments of moneys into the fund for each owner of the facility that shall not be less than necessary to reach the projected cost of decommissioning, as determined by the committee.  The schedule of payments shall be based upon the funding date established by the committee and the owner's individual funding requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the committee determines that the owner has provided funding assurance sufficient to ensure payment of the owner's proportionate share of the full decommissioning cost of the facility, including full funding for decommissioning in the event of a premature permanent cessation of operation, the committee may then establish a schedule of payments for that owner, which shall be collected over a period of time not to exceed the remaining license life of the facility.  Any such schedule of payments shall be in lieu of a schedule of payments based on the funding date.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-F:21-b Customer Nuclear Decommissioning Charge. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The public utilities commission shall permit an electric utility with a franchise territory in the state to charge its customers on a per kilowatt hour basis the amount it pays directly into the fund, as required by the committee pursuant to a schedule of payments established under this chapter.  The amount of the per kilowatt hour charges to utility customers shall be reviewed and approved by the public utilities commission.  The charge, as approved by the public utilities commission, shall be designated a nuclear decommissioning charge and shall be separately stated on the customer's billing statement.  Customer financial responsibility for decommissioning is limited solely to moneys paid into the fund pursuant to a nuclear decommissioning charge approved by the public utilities commission under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Any nuclear decommissioning charge included on utility customers' billing statements shall be discontinued within 30 days if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The permanent cessation of a facility's operations occurs;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The owner or owners voluntarily cease to generate electricity for more than 6 months, other than for scheduled or unscheduled repairs;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The public utilities commission finds that the facility is no longer generating electric energy, and that decommissioning of the facility should be commenced;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The electric utility transfers its ownership interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the customer nuclear decommissioning charge for an electric utility is discontinued, the committee may institute a revised schedule for funding requirements to cover the costs of decommissioning.  The revised funding schedule may include payments made by the owner or owners separate from customer charges.  The committee shall hold at least one public hearing relative to establishing the revised funding schedule, consistent with the public hearing requirements established in RSA 162-F:21.  All testimony shall be transcribed and made a permanent record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon the discontinuation of a customer nuclear decommissioning charge due to the transfer by a utility of an ownership interest occurring after January 1, 2001, the committee shall determine the portion of the fund contributed by New Hampshire customers of the electric utility, including interest and earnings as of the date of ownership transfer, and designate that portion of the fund as the customer contribution.  If decommissioning is completed for less than the customer contribution, the excess shall be refunded to customers in a manner determined by the public utilities commission.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-F:22 Changes to the Fund;  Payment Schedule;  Funding Assurance. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every 4 years the committee shall meet to review the fund and may increase or decrease the projected cost of decommissioning the facility and the schedule of payments into the fund.  Reasons for increasing or decreasing the projected cost of decommissioning and schedule of payments include, but are not limited to, changes in owner or owners, the financial condition of an owner or owners, need, safety, reliability, technology, or other changes in circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The committee shall meet at least once each calendar year to review the cumulative fund performance and each funding assurance in place pursuant to an order of the committee, and the committee may alter the payment schedule, or require a change in any funding assurance to ensure adequate funding by each owner of its decommissioning obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At any time the committee may meet to determine whether the amount of the fund, schedule of payments, or any funding assurance in place pursuant to an order of the committee shall be increased, decreased, or otherwise altered for reasons including changes in owner or owners, the financial condition of an owner or owners, need, safety, reliability, technology, or other changes in circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Prepayment of a funding obligation by an owner or owners, or the payment of the minimum decommissioning funding requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to RSA 162-F:21-a, shall not require another owner to make such a payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Prior to altering the projected cost of decommissioning the facility, the committee shall hold at least one public hearing in the city or town where the facility is located.  All testimony shall be transcribed and made a permanent record.  Prior to changing the projected cost of decommissioning or imposing a funding assurance requirement for an ownership interest, the committee shall conduct an adjudicative proceeding.  Prior to the transfer of an ownership interest the committee may, by a non-adjudicative proceeding, approve proposed funding assurances and make any necessary associated changes to a schedule of payments to reflect the approved funding assurances.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Expenditures from the fund shall be limited to decommissioning of the facility for which the fund was established.  The committee shall review all expenditures from such fund during actual decommissioning to confirm that utilization of the fund is in accordance with the requirements of the committee and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and that the state and federal tax status of the fund is maintained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Prior to withdrawal of moneys from the fund for decommissioning activities, the committee shall be provided with, and must approve, a summary of decommissioning actions to be taken, including the schedule for taking such actions.  Fund withdrawals other than those allowed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may be used only for expenses associated with legitimate decommissioning activities, consistent with the definition of decommissioning in RSA 162-F:14, II, and may not inhibit the ability to complete funding of all required decommissioning activities.  There shall be no decommissioning activities performed that foreclose release of the site for possible unrestricted use, result in significant unreviewed environmental impacts, or result in there no longer being reasonable assurance that adequate funds will be available for decommissioning.  If perpetual, continual control or surveillance of a facility is necessary, the fund shall be maintained at a level sufficient to yield income to maintain such control or surveillance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any fund amount remaining after completion of decommissioning as determined by the committee and after the date of license termination by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in excess of the customer contribution as accounted for in RSA 162-F:21-b, II(c), shall be returned to the owner or owners of the facility.
