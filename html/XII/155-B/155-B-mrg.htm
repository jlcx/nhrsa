&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-B:9 Enforcement of Judgment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a judgment is not complied with in the time prescribed, the governing body may cause the building to be repaired, razed, or removed as set forth in the judgment.  The cost of such repairs, razing, or removal shall be a lien against the real estate on which the building is located and may be levied and collected in the same manner as provided in RSA 80 for tax liens.  When the building is razed or removed by the municipality, the governing body may sell the salvage and valuable materials at public auction upon 3 days' posted notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the value of the subject real estate is deemed by the municipality to have insufficient value, based on the current tax assessment, to cover the cost of repairs, razing, or removal, the governing body may place a lien for the balance of the cost on any other real property in the state that is owned by the same owner, which additional lien may be levied and collected in the same manner as provided in RSA 80 for tax liens;  provided that RSA 80:59 giving such liens priority over all other liens shall not apply.  The municipal lien shall be subordinate to any lien of record on such real property.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-B:9-a Municipal Lien on Owner's Interest in Property Insurance Proceeds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the value of the subject real estate is deemed by the municipality to have insufficient value, based on the current tax assessment, to cover the cost of repairs, razing, or removal, and the owner has no other real property within the state, a municipality may assert a lien on the owner's interest in any real property insurance proceeds that are payable as a result of the damage or destruction of that property owner's real property located in the municipality.  The lien shall be for the estimated cost to repair, raze, or remove the damaged structure, whichever of those options is the least expensive, minus the value in the remaining real property based on the current tax assessments.  The municipal lien shall be subordinate to any lien holder of record, and to any rights, title, or interest in such real property insurance proceeds in favor of any lender holding a mortgage on such real property and who was named as an additional insured or loss payee, by means of loss payable endorsement or otherwise, on any policy of insurance insuring such real property.  The insurer's obligations under this section shall commence upon its receipt of a copy of the order under RSA 155-B:4, and a statement of the estimated lien amount allowed under this section, and shall apply only to insurance proceeds held by the insurer as of that date and due to be paid to the owner.  The lien, the estimated cost of which shall be approved by the court, shall be for the purpose of reimbursing the municipality for all costs permitted to be recovered by it under RSA 155-B if the municipality elects to demolish the property.  Any unexpended funds from the lien shall be returned to the property owner.  The property owner shall, within 72 hours of the receipt of a written request by the municipality, provide the municipality with the names, addresses, agents, and policy numbers of all insurance companies which have provided the property owner with insurance on the property.  The lien shall automatically expire if the owner rebuilds or demolishes the real property in the manner required by this chapter and the municipality shall provide a written release of the lien to the insurer and the property owner.  The insurer shall distribute all proceeds due to the property owner that exceed the lien amount allowed under this section.  The municipality shall release the lien in order to permit payment for repairs, razing, or removal of the building.

<center><h3>Section 155-B:10</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-B:10 Statement of Monies Received. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The municipality shall keep an accurate account of the expenses incurred in carrying out the order and of all other expenses theretofore incurred in connection with its enforcement, including specifically, but not exclusively, filing fees, service fees, publication fees, appraisers' fees, witness fees, including expert witness fees, and traveling expenses incurred by the municipality from the time the order was originally made, and shall credit thereon the amount, if any, received from the sale of the salvage, or building or structure, and shall report its action under the order, with a statement of monies received and expenses incurred to the court for approval and allowance.  Thereupon the court shall examine, correct, if necessary, and allow the expense account, and, if the amount received from the sale of the salvage, or of the building or structure, does not equal or exceed the amount of expenses as allowed, the court shall by its judgment certify the deficiency in the amount so allowed to the municipal clerk for collection.  The owner or other party in interest shall pay the same, without penalty added thereon, and in default of payment by December 1, the clerk shall certify the amount of the expense to the collector for entry on the tax lists as a charge against the real estate on which the building is or was situated and the same shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes and the amount so collected shall be paid into the municipal treasury.  If the amount received for the sale of the salvage or of the building or structure exceeds the expense incurred by the municipality as allowed by the court, and if there are no delinquent taxes, the court shall direct the payment of the surplus to the owner or the payment of the same into court, as provided in this chapter.  If there are delinquent taxes against the property, the court shall direct the payment of the surplus to the municipal treasurer to be applied to such taxes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-B:11 Payment, Tender, Deposit in Court. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The net proceeds of a sale under RSA 155-B:9 or 12 shall be paid to persons designated in the judgment in the proportions as their interests shall appear therein.  Acceptance of such payment shall be taken as a waiver of all objections to the payment and to the proceedings leading thereto on the part of the payee and of all persons for whom he is lawfully empowered to act.  In case any party to whom a payment of damages is made be not a resident of the state, or his place of residence be unknown, or he be an infant or other person under legal disability, or, being legally capable, refuses to accept payment, or if for any reason it be doubtful to whom any payment should be paid, the municipality may pay the same to the clerk of court to be paid out under the direction of the court;  and, unless an appeal be taken such deposit with the clerk shall be deemed a payment of the award.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-B:12 Personal Property of Fixtures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If any building ordered razed, removed, or made safe and sanitary by repairs contains personal property or fixtures which will unreasonably interfere with the razing, removal, or repair of such building, or if the razing or removal of the building makes necessary the removal of such personal property or fixtures, the original order of the governing body may direct the removal of such personal property or fixtures within a reasonable time.  If the property or fixtures are not removed by the time specified, and the governing body subsequently desires to enforce a judgment under the provisions of this chapter, it may sell the same at public auction as provided in RSA 155-B:9 or if without appreciable value, the governing body may destroy the same.

<codesect>
If in any city or town, an excavation for building purposes is left open for more than 6 months without proceeding with the erection of a building thereon, whether or not completed, or if any excavation or basement is not filled to grade or otherwise protected after a building is destroyed, demolished or removed, the governing body may order such excavation to be filled or protected or in the alternative that erection of a building begin forthwith if the excavation is for building purposes.  The order shall be served upon the owner or his agent in the manner provided by RSA 155-B:4.  If the owner of the land fails to comply with the order within 15 days after the order is served upon him, the governing body shall cause the excavation to be filled to grade or protected and the cost shall be charged against the real estate as provided in RSA 155-B:9.
