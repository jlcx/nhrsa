<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a judgment is not complied with in the time prescribed, the governing body may cause the building to be repaired, razed, or removed as set forth in the judgment.  The cost of such repairs, razing, or removal shall be a lien against the real estate on which the building is located and may be levied and collected in the same manner as provided in RSA 80 for tax liens.  When the building is razed or removed by the municipality, the governing body may sell the salvage and valuable materials at public auction upon 3 days' posted notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the value of the subject real estate is deemed by the municipality to have insufficient value, based on the current tax assessment, to cover the cost of repairs, razing, or removal, the governing body may place a lien for the balance of the cost on any other real property in the state that is owned by the same owner, which additional lien may be levied and collected in the same manner as provided in RSA 80 for tax liens;  provided that RSA 80:59 giving such liens priority over all other liens shall not apply.  The municipal lien shall be subordinate to any lien of record on such real property.
