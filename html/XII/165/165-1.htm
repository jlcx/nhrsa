<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The process for application for general assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The criteria for determining eligibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The process for appealing a decision relative to the granting of general assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The process for the application of rents under RSA 165:4-b, if the municipality uses the offset provisions of RSA 165:4-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A statement that qualified state assistance reductions under RSA 167:82, VIII may be deemed as income, if the local governing body has permitted the welfare administrator to treat a qualified state assistance reduction as deemed income under RSA 165:1-e.
