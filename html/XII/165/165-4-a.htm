&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 165:4-a Application of Rents Paid by the Municipality. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever the owner of property rented to a person receiving assistance under this chapter is in arrears in sewer, water, electricity, or tax payments to the municipality, the municipality may apply, upon approval of the governing body, the assistance which the property owner would have received in payment of rent on behalf of such assisted person to the property owner's delinquent balances, regardless of whether such delinquent balances are in respect of property occupied by the assisted person.  For purposes of this section, a payment shall be considered "in arrears'' if more than 30 days have elapsed since the mailing of the bill, or in the case of real estate taxes, if interest has begun to accrue pursuant to RSA 76:13.
