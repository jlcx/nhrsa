<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A statement that qualified state assistance reductions under RSA 167:82, VIII may be deemed as income, if the local governing body has permitted the welfare administrator to treat a qualified state assistance reduction as deemed income under RSA 165:1-e.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person otherwise eligible for assistance under this chapter shall become ineligible to receive such assistance if he willfully fails to comply with written guidelines adopted by the governing body of the town or city relating to:

(a) Disclosure of income, resources, or other material financial data;

(a) A written notice stating those specific actions he must take in order to comply;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The written notice shall include a list of the guidelines with which the person is not in compliance, those actions necessary for compliance, and written notice of the opportunity to request a hearing within 5 days.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The overseers of public welfare shall not be required to accept an application for general assistance from a person who is subject to disqualification or suspension under this section;  provided, however, that in the event such disqualification or suspension continues beyond the 7 or 14-day period due to continued noncompliance pursuant to paragraph IV, and there is a dispute over a contention by such person that he has satisfactorily complied with the requirements set forth in the notice required by paragraph III, such person shall be given an opportunity to request a hearing to determine that issue, but paragraph IV shall not apply to such a hearing.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person eligible for assistance under this chapter, who voluntarily terminated employment within the 60-day period before filing an application for assistance, shall be ineligible to receive assistance for 90 days from the date of employment termination, provided the following conditions are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The person received general assistance within the last 365 days and was given notice that voluntary termination of employment without good cause could lead to disqualification from receiving general assistance in the future.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) There are no minor or dependent children in the person's household which the person is legally responsible for supporting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At the time of termination of employment, the person did not have a mental or physical impairment which caused such person to be unable to work.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The employment that the person voluntarily terminated consisted of at least 20 hours of work per week, and the person has not become reemployed for at least 2 weeks at a level consisting of at least 20 hours of work per week.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The person did not have good cause for terminating the employment, as defined in paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Good cause for terminating employment shall include any of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Discrimination by an employer based on age, race, sex, physical or mental disability, religion, or national origin.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Work demands or conditions that render continued employment unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Retirement by a person 62 years of age or over or resignation by a person under 62 years of age which is recognized by the employer as retirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Employment which becomes unsuitable following the applicant's acceptance of such employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Leaving a job in order to accept a bonafide job offer which, because of circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, subsequently either does not materialize or results in employment of fewer than 20 hours per week or weekly earnings of less than the state or federal hourly minimum wage multiplied by 20 hours.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Leaving a job in connection with patterns of employment in which workers frequently move from one employer to another, such as migrant farm labor or construction work, even though employment at the new site has not actually begun.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Leaving a job because of circumstances, such as lack of transportation or a household emergency, which are beyond the control of the applicant to remedy as determined by the overseer of public welfare and which make continued employment impracticable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Termination of employment for other good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The applicant shall be responsible for demonstrating good cause.  The welfare officer may offer assistance in obtaining necessary information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An applicant shall be considered to have voluntarily terminated employment if the applicant fails to report for work without good cause, as defined in paragraph II, resulting in the termination of the applicant's employment.  An applicant who is fired or resigns from a job at the request of the employer due to the applicant's inability to maintain the employer's normal work productivity standard shall not be considered to have voluntarily terminated employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No person shall be found ineligible for assistance due to a voluntary employment termination unless the applicant has been given a written application for assistance and a written notice stating the reason for the denial of assistance and the specific actions which must be taken in order to reinstate eligibility, along with a written notice of the opportunity to request a hearing within 5 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding a voluntary termination without good cause, assistance under this chapter may be given if the welfare officer determines that denial of assistance will put that person or members of the person's household at substantial risk of injury to health or other serious harm, which cannot be avoided or mitigated by other public or private resources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The provisions of RSA 165:1-b, II-VI shall not apply to persons found ineligible for assistance because of voluntary termination of employment without good cause.  However, if at any time during the disqualification period, there is a dispute whether a person has satisfactorily complied with the requirements set forth in the written notice provided for by paragraph V, the person shall be given an opportunity to request a hearing to determine that issue only.

Should a relation refuse to render such aid when requested to do so by a county commissioner, selectman, or overseer of public welfare, such person or persons shall upon complaint of one of these officials be summoned to appear in court.  If, after hearing, it is found that the alleged poor person is in need of assistance, and that the relation is able to render such assistance, the court shall enter a decree accordingly and shall fix the amount and character of the assistance which the relation shall furnish.  If the relation neglects or refuses to comply with the court order without good cause, as determined by the court at a hearing, or by refusing to work or otherwise voluntarily places himself in a position where he is unable to comply, he shall be deemed to be in contempt of court and shall be imprisoned not more than 90 nor fewer than 60 days.  If a poor person has no relation of sufficient ability, the town or city in which he resides shall be liable for his support.
