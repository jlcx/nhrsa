Any person who desires to sell display and consumer fireworks as limited by RSA 160-B:2 may apply to the municipality in which such person desires to sell fireworks.  Such application shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner.  The licensing board of any municipality or, if one does not exist, the governing body may issue a permit to sell display and consumer fireworks to a person who applies, provided that the person has a valid permit for the sale of fireworks issued pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code.

The municipality may charge a fee for the permit or application for permit under this section.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII.

Upon application of any person, the commissioner, or a person designated by the commissioner, may issue a license authorizing the applicant to sell or market display and consumer fireworks in this state, provided the person has first obtained a permit to sell display and consumer fireworks pursuant to RSA 160-B:6, I.  The license shall bear the name, address, description, and signature of the licensee.  The license shall be displayed at all times, openly and publicly, at the licensee's place of business.  The license shall be issued within a reasonable time after application.  The license shall be valid for not more than one year from the date of issue and may be renewed on May 1 of the following year.  The initial licensing fee shall be pro-rated to correspond with the initial date of issue.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The state license may be issued to an applicant who, at the time such license is issued, possesses a permit issued in accordance with the provisions of title 18, United States Code, governing fireworks, and a permit issued pursuant to RSA 160-B:6, I.  No license shall be issued for the sale of display and consumer fireworks unless the applicant establishes that it will locate its business in a permanent structure which meets all applicable fire safety codes, building codes, zoning codes, and the requirements of local ordinances.  No license for the sale of display and consumer fireworks shall be issued to or held by any person who has been convicted of a felony if the felony has not been annulled by a court of record.  No license shall be issued to any person under 21 years of age.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII-a. Buildings used for the sale or storage of display and consumer fireworks shall be dedicated solely to the sale or storage of display and consumer fireworks and items relating to the sale and promotion of fireworks provided for in rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the state fire code adopted pursuant to RSA 153:5.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII-b. Prior to the issuance of a state license, the department of safety may conduct a background investigation of the applicant and may conduct an inspection of the site, including all buildings, in which the display and consumer fireworks are to be sold or stored.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. If the application for a state license is denied, the reasons for such denial shall be stated in writing, in duplicate, the original of which shall be delivered to the applicant, and the copy thereof kept in the office of the department of safety.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. The fee for a license for each location shall be $1,500 per year, payable annually to the department of safety for deposit into the general fund.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. A person who has a federal permit issued in accordance with the provisions of title 18, United States Code, governing fireworks, a state license issued pursuant to this section, and a local permit issued pursuant to this section may sell display and consumer fireworks;  however, such a person shall only sell display fireworks to a person who shows a certificate of competency issued pursuant to RSA 158:9-f, or who shows a license for the storage of display fireworks issued pursuant to RSA 158:9-c, or a license to sell display and consumer fireworks pursuant to this chapter.  Any sale which the seller makes shall be recorded, and the record, at a minimum, shall contain a copy of the purchaser's certificate of competency and display permit and, in the case of a wholesale sale, the purchaser's retail number from the state of residence, IRS tax identification number or such other information as the commissioner shall specify by rule adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. A wholesale sale shall not be made to a person or corporation which resides in New Hampshire other than to a person or corporation licensed to sell fireworks pursuant to paragraphs I-III of this section.  Any wholesale sale shall be shipped by common carrier or by the wholesaler making the sale.  For the purposes of this shipment the wholesaler shall not be authorized to make any person an agent for the limited purpose of transporting fireworks.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII.
