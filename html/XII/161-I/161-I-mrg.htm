<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Many individuals require assistance with eating, bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, and activities of daily living to maintain their independence and dignity.  Personal care services are non-medical, hands-on supports that substitute for the loss of an individual's physical or cognitive functioning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Many individuals requiring personal care services and families who have children with special health care needs want to choose who delivers personal care services and how and when these services are delivered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This chapter provides individuals and families with the option of receiving personal care services, including consumer-directed services, from a home health agency or other qualified agency.
