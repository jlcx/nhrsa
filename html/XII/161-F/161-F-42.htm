&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 161-F:42 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this subdivision is to provide protection for vulnerable adults who are abused, neglected, or exploited.  Implicit in this subdivision is the philosophy that whenever possible an adult's right to self-determination should be preserved, and that each adult should live in safe conditions and should live his own life without interruption from state government.  Only when these principles become impossible to follow should legal proceedings be initiated in order to care for and protect such adults.
