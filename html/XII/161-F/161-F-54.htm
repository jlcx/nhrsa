The probate court, at any time, may order a proposed ward to submit to a medical or psychiatric examination to be completed within 30 days by a licensed psychologist, licensed psychiatrist or physician, or local community mental health center.  A written report of such examination shall be forwarded to the court and shall contain, but not be limited to, the proposed ward's disease or disability, if any, the proposed ward's present mental status, and the prognosis.  If the proposed ward objects to the evaluation, the probate court having jurisdiction shall be notified in writing within 5 days after notification of the time and place of such evaluation, and the court shall hold a hearing to consider the objection prior to ordering such evaluation or, upon good cause shown, may excuse the proposed ward from the provisions of this section.
