IV. The governor and council shall not award any state guarantee under this section unless they have found after a hearing that such guarantee will serve a public use and provide a public benefit and have determined that the authority's financing of the project and the state's guarantee of the bonds will be within the policy of, and the authority conferred by, this chapter.
<br>

In addition, the governor and council shall also find that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The award of a state guarantee will contribute significantly to the success of the financing;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Reasonable and appropriate measures have been taken to minimize the risk of loss to the state and to ensure that any private benefit from the award of a state guarantee will be only incidental to the public purpose served thereby.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The hearing required by this section may be held and the findings and determinations so required may be made in conjunction with the proceedings required by RSA 162-I:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Whenever a state guarantee of bonds is awarded under this section, the statement requirement in the first sentence of RSA 162-I:8, III shall be appropriately modified and the finding required by RSA 162-I:9, II(b)(4) shall not be made.
