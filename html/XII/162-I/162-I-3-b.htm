<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established in the office of the state treasurer a fund to be known as the intrastate energy pipeline facility revolving loan fund which shall be kept separate and distinct from all other funds.  Moneys in the fund shall be nonlapsing and shall be continually appropriated to the authority, and shall be used to provide loans for the construction of intrastate energy pipeline facilities in the state in order to increase the state's ability to meet the energy needs of its citizens and businesses at the lowest reasonable cost, while providing for the reliability and diversity of energy sources.  The intrastate energy pipeline facilities shall be eligible for the revolving funds upon the operator receiving all applicable local, state, and federal permits.  Loans provided to operators of intrastate energy pipeline facilities shall be approved by the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility provided a loan under this section shall furnish assurance to the authority by a signed agreement that the facility intends to operate as an intrastate energy provider for the life of the capital improvement for which the funds are loaned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility shall repay any loan made pursuant to this section upon such terms and conditions as are required by the authority.  The term of the loan shall be no less than 5 years and no longer than 20 years, and shall to the extent possible consistent with this section be determined so as to match the useful life of the improvements funded by the loan.  The terms and conditions shall be contained in the binding agreement between the state and the operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility and shall be sufficient to fully reimburse the state for the principal and interest payments on that portion of the bonds authorized to fund the loan.  The authority shall execute all such binding agreements on behalf of the state.  All money received through reimbursement shall be deposited by the state treasurer in the intrastate energy pipeline facility revolving loan fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition to such other terms and conditions that the authority may impose with regard to collateral for a loan, a lien on the property and equipment of the operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility, including the improved property or equipment, shall be created in favor of the state in an amount which equals the sum of principal and interest to be repaid by the operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility.  The lien shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of the county or counties in which the improved property is situated and shall not supersede any pre-existing lien created by a mortgage, bond indenture, or similar form of security instrument affecting such property.  The lien shall expire only when the loan has been fully repaid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. To provide funds for the revolving loan fund established pursuant to this section, the state treasurer, as may be requested from time to time by the authority, is authorized to borrow from time to time upon the credit of the state such amounts so that the aggregate principal amount of the bonds outstanding at any time shall not exceed $10,000,000 and for said purposes may issue bonds and notes at such time in the name and on behalf of the state of New Hampshire in accordance with the provisions of RSA 6-A.  The authority shall request and the treasurer shall issue bonds only for such amounts from time to time as are required for the purposes of this section and provided that the principal and interest payments can be satisfied from sums in the fund established in paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The payments of principal and interest on the bonds issued under paragraph V shall be made when due from the special fund established by paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. While the authority shall administer the fund as set forth in this section, and shall have the authority to charge borrowers to whom funds are loaned a fee to reimburse the authority for the services provided by it and costs incurred by it, the authority shall have no financial responsibility for the bonds issued under this section, said bonds being the obligation of the state as set forth in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The operator of the intrastate pipeline facility shall reimburse the state treasurer for any expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of bonds under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The state treasurer shall submit a report by December 1 of each even-numbered year to the governor, to the chairperson of the house commerce committee, and to the chairperson of the senate economic development committee.  The report shall be prepared in consultation with the executive director of the business finance authority and shall describe the activity of the revolving loan fund established pursuant to this section.
