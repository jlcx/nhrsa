<codesect>
<br>

The intrastate energy pipeline facilities shall be eligible for the revolving funds upon the operator receiving all applicable local, state, and federal permits.  Loans provided to operators of intrastate energy pipeline facilities shall be approved by the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility shall repay any loan made pursuant to this section upon such terms and conditions as are required by the authority.  The term of the loan shall be no less than 5 years and no longer than 20 years, and shall to the extent possible consistent with this section be determined so as to match the useful life of the improvements funded by the loan.  The terms and conditions shall be contained in the binding agreement between the state and the operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility and shall be sufficient to fully reimburse the state for the principal and interest payments on that portion of the bonds authorized to fund the loan.  The authority shall execute all such binding agreements on behalf of the state.  All money received through reimbursement shall be deposited by the state treasurer in the intrastate energy pipeline facility revolving loan fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition to such other terms and conditions that the authority may impose with regard to collateral for a loan, a lien on the property and equipment of the operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility, including the improved property or equipment, shall be created in favor of the state in an amount which equals the sum of principal and interest to be repaid by the operator of the intrastate energy pipeline facility.  The lien shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of the county or counties in which the improved property is situated and shall not supersede any pre-existing lien created by a mortgage, bond indenture, or similar form of security instrument affecting such property.  The lien shall expire only when the loan has been fully repaid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. To provide funds for the revolving loan fund established pursuant to this section, the state treasurer, as may be requested from time to time by the authority, is authorized to borrow from time to time upon the credit of the state such amounts so that the aggregate principal amount of the bonds outstanding at any time shall not exceed $10,000,000 and for said purposes may issue bonds and notes at such time in the name and on behalf of the state of New Hampshire in accordance with the provisions of RSA 6-A.  The authority shall request and the treasurer shall issue bonds only for such amounts from time to time as are required for the purposes of this section and provided that the principal and interest payments can be satisfied from sums in the fund established in paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The payments of principal and interest on the bonds issued under paragraph V shall be made when due from the special fund established by paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. While the authority shall administer the fund as set forth in this section, and shall have the authority to charge borrowers to whom funds are loaned a fee to reimburse the authority for the services provided by it and costs incurred by it, the authority shall have no financial responsibility for the bonds issued under this section, said bonds being the obligation of the state as set forth in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The operator of the intrastate pipeline facility shall reimburse the state treasurer for any expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of bonds under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX.

The report shall be prepared in consultation with the executive director of the business finance authority and shall describe the activity of the revolving loan fund established pursuant to this section.

(3) The financing and security documents contain provisions so that under no circumstances will the authority be obligated directly or indirectly to pay project costs, debt service or expenses of operation, maintenance and upkeep of the facility except from bond proceeds or from funds received under the financing or security documents, exclusive of funds received under the documents by the authority for its own use;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Neither the financing document nor the security document purports to create any debt of the state with respect to the facility, other than a special obligation of the authority acting on behalf of the state under this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The proposed financing of the project by the authority and the proposed operation and use of the facility will serve one or more needs and implement one or more purposes set forth in RSA 162-I:1, will preserve or increase the social or economic prosperity of the state and one or more of its political subdivisions, and will promote the general welfare of the state's citizens.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section shall prevent the authority from giving preliminary official approval of a proposed project and the financing of the proposed project.  The findings and determination by the governor and council may be made upon the written recommendation of the authority supported by any documentation and information which the governor and council may request.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-I:9-a State Guarantee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governor and council may award an unconditional state guarantee of the principal of and interest on bonds issued under this chapter.  Any guarantee awarded pursuant to this section shall be solely for the purpose of financing a redevelopment district, and only to the extent the bonds are to be self-supporting for purposes of RSA 6-C:1, II.  The full faith and credit of the state shall be pledged for any such guarantee, but the total outstanding principal amount of bonds guaranteed by the state under this section at any time shall not exceed $30,000,000.  For the purpose of determining the amount of bonds guaranteed by the state pursuant to this section, the amount of any issue of bonds sold at a discount shall be equal to the net proceeds thereof, determined by adding to the face amount of the bond issue the premium, if any, related to bonds of that issue and then subtracting the discount related to bonds of that issue.  The amount of bonds of any such issue considered outstanding at any time shall be determined by multiplying the face amount of the bonds of that issue then outstanding by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net proceeds of the issue as determined above, and the denominator of which is the face amount of the issue.  The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, is authorized to draw his warrant for such sum as may be necessary out of any money in the treasury, not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of honoring any guarantee awarded under this section.  The state's guarantee shall be evidenced on each guaranteed bond by an endorsement signed by the state treasurer in substantially the following form:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The state of New Hampshire hereby unconditionally guarantees the payment of the whole of the principal and interest on the within bond and for the performance of such guarantee the full faith and credit of the state are pledged.

In connection with the award of a state guarantee, the governor and council may impose such terms and conditions as they may deem appropriate concerning the bonds, the use and operation of the eligible facilities, the reimbursement to the state if any state funds are used to honor the guarantee and any other matters necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this section.  Such terms and conditions may be contained in an agreement among the state, the authority and user of the eligible facility to be executed on behalf of the state by the governor and the state treasurer and on behalf of the authority by any 2 persons authorized to execute bonds under RSA 162-I:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The governor and council shall not award any state guarantee under this section unless they have found after a hearing that such guarantee will serve a public use and provide a public benefit and have determined that the authority's financing of the project and the state's guarantee of the bonds will be within the policy of, and the authority conferred by, this chapter.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Before awarding any state guarantee of bonds under this section the governor and council shall first make the findings required by RSA 162-I:9, except the finding required by RSA 162-I:9, II(b)(4), taking into account the state guarantee.  In addition, the governor and council shall also find that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The financing of the facility is of vital importance to the economic well being and general welfare of a substantial number of the state's citizens and will minimize the risk of permanent economic damage to the state or a region of the state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The award of a state guarantee will contribute significantly to the success of the financing;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Reasonable and appropriate measures have been taken to minimize the risk of loss to the state and to ensure that any private benefit from the award of a state guarantee will be only incidental to the public purpose served thereby.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The hearing required by this section may be held and the findings and determinations so required may be made in conjunction with the proceedings required by RSA 162-I:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Whenever a state guarantee of bonds is awarded under this section the statement required by the first sentence of RSA 162-I:8, III shall be appropriately modified and the finding required by RSA 162-I:9, II(b)(4) shall not be made.
