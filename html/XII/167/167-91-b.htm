I. For the purposes of RSA 281-A, an employment program participant is an employee of both the state and the sponsor.  In the event that it is determined that the participant has been subject to an injury or occupational disease producing a disability arising out of and in the course of participation in the employment program, the program shall not provide compensation pursuant to RSA 281-A:28, 281-A:28-a, 281-A:31, and 281-A:31-a, but the participant shall receive benefits from the employment program while otherwise eligible, or compensation equivalent to those benefits if the participant becomes ineligible for benefits under RSA 167.  When determining the amount of compensation provided pursuant to RSA 281-A:32 for a scheduled permanent impairment award, the amount of compensation shall be calculated by using the minimum wage at the time of injury multiplied by the average number of hours worked per week or the number of hours agreed to by the program and the participant, whichever is higher.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of health and human services may provide this benefit by appropriate means including purchasing and serving as the master policyholder for any insurance, by self-insurance or by administrative services contract.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, all other provisions of RSA 281-A apply.
