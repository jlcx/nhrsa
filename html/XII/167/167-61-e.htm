&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:61-e Award to Relator. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the state proceeds with an action brought by a relator under RSA 167:61-c, the relator shall, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the relator substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action.  Where the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the relator bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information furnished by the relator and the role of the relator bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation.  Any payment to a relator under this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds.  The relator shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whether or not the state proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a relator who planned and initiated the violation of RSA 167:61-b upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that the relator would otherwise receive under paragraph I, taking into account the role of the relator in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation.  If the relator bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from the relator's role in the violation of RSA 167:61-b, the relator shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action.  The dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the state to continue the action represented by the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under RSA 167:61-c:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Against any department official or any division, board, bureau, commission or agency within the department;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When the relator is a present or former employee of the state and the action is based upon information discovered by the employee during the course of the employee's employment, unless the employee first, in good faith, exhausted any existing internal procedures for reporting and seeking recovery of the falsely claimed sums through official channels and the state failed to act on the information provided within a reasonable period of time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding, in which the state is already a party;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That is based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the relator bringing the action is an original source of the information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The state shall not be liable for expenses or fees, including attorneys' fees, that a relator incurs in bringing an action under RSA 167:61-c and shall not elect to pay those expenses or fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the state does not proceed with an action brought by a relator under RSA 167:61-c, the relator bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount that the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages.  The amount shall not be less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds.  The relator shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs.  All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the state does not proceed with an action brought by a relator under RSA 167:61-c and the relator conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorneys fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.
