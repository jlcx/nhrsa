&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:2-b Employment of Relatives of Persons Receiving Public Welfare Assistance. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No person who is otherwise eligible for public assistance based on financial need shall receive public welfare assistance from the state unless and until all able-bodied adult persons, under the age of 65 years, except those regularly attending school, related to such person, and regularly residing in the same household as such person, and legally liable to contribute to the support of such person and not prevented from maintaining employment and contributing to the support of such person by reason of physical or mental disability or other substantial or other justifiable cause, are employed on a full-time basis.  The amount or amounts earned by the persons obliged to maintain employment hereunder shall be taken into consideration in determining the level of need for public assistance.  Nothing in this section shall be so construed to deny to any minor dependent child any needed public assistance to which he or she would be otherwise entitled.  Unrelated adult persons living in the same household in loco parentis as to any such person seeking public assistance shall be obliged to contribute to his or her support to the same extent as the parent of such person, and in default thereof, shall be subject to the same penalties as the parent of such person would be in such case.  If anything in this section conflicts with federal law or regulation related thereto, the federal law or regulation shall take precedence.
