I. If the state proceeds with an action under RSA 167:61-c, the state shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and shall not be bound by an act of the relator bringing the action.  The relator shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the following limitations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The state may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the relator initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing on the motion, that dismissal should be allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The state may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the relator initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances.  Upon a showing of good cause, the hearing may be held in camera.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding RSA 167:61-c, the state may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the state, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil monetary penalty.  If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the relator initiating the action shall have the same rights in the proceeding as the relator would have had if the action had continued under this section.  Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The parties to the action shall receive court approval of any settlements reached.
