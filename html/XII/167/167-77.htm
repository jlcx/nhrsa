&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:77 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this subdivision is to reform welfare through the vehicle made available by the federal government.  To the extent permitted by federal law, it is the intent of the general court to operate the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program through 2 subprograms:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The New Hampshire employment program which shall provide financial assistance for families with dependent children when the children are cared for by a parent or relative who is receiving assistance and is considered to be able-bodied for employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The family assistance program which shall provide financial assistance for families with dependent children when the parent or other relative is considered unable to work due to a physical or mental disability or the children are cared for by a relative other than a parent who is not receiving assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The New Hampshire employment program and the family assistance program are the financial assistance programs upon which Medicaid and Food Stamps are automatically granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other laws to the contrary, the New Hampshire employment program and family assistance program shall be covered by this subdivision and the rules adopted under the authority of this section.  All statutory provisions within RSA 161 and 167 which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this subdivision shall remain in full force and effect and shall apply to the New Hampshire employment program and the family assistance program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The New Hampshire employment program shall promote economic independence and help maintain and strengthen family life by enabling able-bodied persons with dependent children to assume responsibility for their families through the dignity of work.  Work shall be promoted by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Offering employment services, support services, and transitional financial assistance with the expectation that participants move quickly towards employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Developing long-term employment skills that lead to self-sufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Supporting job readiness, life skills, workforce training, and barrier resolution programs with proven records of success in ensuring that employment program clients are truly prepared for the workforce and able to maintain self-sufficiency regardless of whether those programs count towards the federal work participation rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Recognizing the equal responsibility of both parents to provide economic support for their children.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The goals of the New Hampshire employment program shall be to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Eliminate or reduce the harmful effects of poverty on families and children by fostering employment and opportunity as a means to economic independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Assist participants to gain employment as rapidly as possible, given due consideration to individual circumstances, labor market conditions, the needs of the dependent children for continuing care and protection, and the ultimate goal of long-term economic independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Eliminate the stigma of welfare by promoting a philosophy and perception that the purpose of welfare is to eliminate or reduce the harmful effects of poverty on families and children by promoting work opportunities for all New Hampshire residents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Support and coordinate with activities that promote self-sufficiency and strengthen family life.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Provide a comprehensive support service package that includes:  medical assistance, food stamps, child care, transportation, child support, and other support services necessary to promote economic independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Promote successful transition from public assistance through the provision of job readiness activities, training, and education activities concurrently with employment or seeking employment, family support skills, and follow-up services for problem resolution and job advancement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Develop partnerships with employers to create job opportunities and meet the needs of both employers and participants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Provide a program where it is more advantageous to work than not to work by rewarding self-sufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Implement a program that is clear, focused, and simple to administer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The goals of the family assistance program shall be to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Eliminate or reduce the harmful effects of poverty on families and children by providing financial assistance and medical assistance only to families with children in a manner compatible with decency and health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Promote employment opportunities.
