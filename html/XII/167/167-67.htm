I. The general court finds that at least 30,000 New Hampshire children lack health insurance.  The lack of available, comprehensive maternity and child health services imposes a great cost, in both human and financial terms, on the citizens of this state.  Both government and industry have long recognized the need for continual reinvestment in physical plant, public infrastructure, marketing, research and development, but less attention has been paid to the need for investment in our state's human resources.  At a time when growing economic competition makes it essential that New Hampshire have a high quality work force, spending on programs to develop that work force is a necessary investment.
