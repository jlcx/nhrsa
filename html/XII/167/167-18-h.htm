&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Proportionate share payments to county nursing homes shall be made each state fiscal year in an amount equal to the maximum permissible by federal regulations.  All payments shall be apportioned to each facility in a percentage equal to that facility's proportion of total county nursing home medicaid utilization.  If the federal government makes adjustments to any proportionate share payments that have been made by the state, the amounts due under this section shall be amended accordingly and adjusted payments shall be made to or from the state as necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, each county government shall reimburse the state for 50 percent of the total cost of proportionate share payments made to the county pursuant to paragraph I.
