I. Except as provided in paragraph II, no person receiving old age assistance or aid to the permanently and totally disabled under this chapter or RSA 161 shall at the same time receive any other relief from the state, or from any political subdivision thereof, except for medical and surgical assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I, a municipality may provide assistance under RSA 165 to a person who is also receiving old age assistance or aid to the permanently and totally disabled if the guidelines adopted by the governing body under RSA 165:1 authorize assistance to such persons, and the acceptance of such relief shall not operate as a revocation of old age assistance or aid to the permanently and totally disabled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The names of persons receiving old age assistance or aid to the permanently and totally disabled under the provisions of this chapter or RSA 161 shall not be printed in any report of the county commissioners or of the commissioner of health and human services nor published in any state, county, or town report.
