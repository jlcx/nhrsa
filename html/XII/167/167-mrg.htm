<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of health and human services may change the minimum duration of impairment for aid to the permanently and totally disabled (APTD) from 48 months to 12 months upon approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, under the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) This change results in a net general fund cost savings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Eligibility for APTD shall be based on a determination of disability as defined in Title II, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and Title XVI, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), of the Social Security Act, as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A determination of disability by the Social Security Administration or any other federal agency, including the Railroad Retirement Board, using the SSI and SSDI criteria, shall constitute a determination of disability for purposes of APTD.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Applicants for APTD cash assistance shall be recipients of SSI, if eligible therefor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) For persons applying for APTD and SSI, eligibility for both programs shall be determined using the medical and financial eligibility criteria of the SSI program, through a single disability determination process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) As of the date the department implements the 12-month standard and other provisions of this paragraph, all persons who have been determined by the department to be disabled under the 48-month durational standard and are eligible for APTD and who have not been determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration or other federal agency using the SSI/SSDI standard, shall remain eligible for APTD if they have active and pending applications for or appeals of denials of SSI, SSDI, or any other federal program utilizing the SSI/ SSDI standard, through the level of the Social Security Appeals Council, provided they meet all other eligibility criteria.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Applicants shall have all appeal rights provided in state and federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner of health and human services is authorized to enter into agreements with agencies of the state or federal government to administer any or all parts of the aid to the permanently and totally disabled (APTD) program, including an agreement with the Social Security Administration in accordance with accordance with section 1634(a) of the Social Security Act, to the extent such agreements would allow for more cost effective or efficient administration of the program.  The department shall implement the most cost-effective organizational and management structure and operational processes, with prior approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, which may include organizational and contractual changes including management responsibility for SSI and SSDI eligibility determinations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the department of health and human services adopts a 12-month standard in accordance with this section, the department may apply any net savings realized from implementing this standard to meet required appropriation reductions for the department contained in the state's operating budget for the biennium ending June 30, 2011.  The department shall estimate net savings based on expenditures for aid to the permanently and totally disabled grants as compared to amounts budgeted in fiscal year 2010 and 2011 for this purpose, net of any increases in Medicaid medical assistance and prescription costs resulting from this change.  The department shall provide semi-annual reports to the fiscal committee of the general court relative to any net savings realized from the implementation of this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary and consistent with section 1917(e) of the Social Security Act as amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, (DEFRA), Public Law 190-171, for purposes of Medicaid eligibility, investment in annuities shall be limited to those annuities that:

(2) All such annuities owned by the applicant or the applicant's spouse shall be disclosed to the department at the time of the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for purposes of medicaid eligibility, investment in life insurance policies with cash surrender value in excess of $1,500 shall be limited to policies that ensure payment to the state of New Hampshire of all the proceeds of the policy in excess of amounts spent on burial up to the total of medicaid expenditures made on behalf of the individual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Pursuant to section 1917(b)(1) of the Social Security Act as amended by DEFRA, the commissioner shall submit a state plan amendment establishing a long-term care partnership recognizing the investment in long-term care insurance policies by Medicaid applicants by disregarding resources or assets in an amount equal to the insurance benefit payments that are made to or on behalf of an individual who is a beneficiary under a long-term care insurance policy which meets the criteria described in DEFRA and regulations promulgated thereunder.  The estates of recipients of medical assistance for institutional level of care for whom the resource ceiling has been adjusted as described in this subparagraph, shall be exempt from recovery pursuant to RSA 167:13 and RSA 167:14 in an amount equal to the insurance benefit payments received.

For purposes hereof, a person shall be eligible for aid to families with dependent children who is a needy child 17 years of age or under or 18 years of age, a full-time student in a secondary school as defined by the commissioner of the department of health and human services, and reasonably expected to complete the program before reaching 19 years of age;  who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, or the unemployment of his or her parent who is the principal wage-earner;  and who is living with his father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, first cousin, nephew or niece, uncle, or aunt (including relatives of half-blood, relatives of preceding generations as denoted by the prefixes of grand, great, or great-great, adoptive parents and their relatives to the same degree as blood relatives and spouses of the above relatives even after the marriage is terminated by death or divorce) in a place of residence in the state maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their home;  or who is an otherwise eligible parent or needy caretaker relative with whom such child lives.  For purposes of this section, a child who meets the above requirements shall be eligible, even if the child was removed from the home of a relative as a result of a judicial determination and was placed in a foster home and care, when the care and placement of the child are the responsibility of the department of health and human services or another public agency which meets federal requirements and the state plan, and when the child received or would have been eligible to receive aid to families with dependent children in the month in which court proceedings were initiated except that such a child need not have lived with a specified relative.  No person shall be eligible to receive such aid while receiving old age assistance, aid to the needy blind, or aid to the permanently and totally disabled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For the purposes hereof, a person shall be eligible for aid to the permanently and totally disabled who is between the ages of 18 and 64 years of age inclusive;  is a resident of the state;  and is disabled as defined in the federal Social Security Act, Titles II and XVI and the regulations adopted under such act, except that the minimum required duration of the impairment shall be 48 months, unless and until the department adopts a 12-month standard in accordance with RSA 167:3-j.

Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, eligibility for cash assistance and medical assistance shall be conditioned upon the recipient filing an application or applications for any federal cash assistance benefits for which the individual may be entitled and pursuing any appeals available for those federal benefits.  Cash assistance shall terminate upon a finding of clinical ineligibility for such federal benefits, except that any individual receiving cash assistance on June 30, 2011 shall only be ineligible for cash assistance upon a second finding of clinical ineligibility.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. For purposes hereof, a person with a disability between 18 and 64 years of age who is eligible to participate in the work incentive program, known as Medicaid for employed adults with disabilities (MEAD), shall be eligible for medical assistance as medically needy or categorically needy.  The department of health and human services shall establish a sliding fee scale for participants to contribute to the cost of such medical assistance.

Except as provided in paragraph II, if at any time during the continuance of assistance, the recipient or the husband or wife of the recipient becomes possessed of any property or income in excess of the amount stated in the application, it shall be the duty of the recipient within 10 calendar days to notify the commissioner of the department of health and human services of the receipt or possession of such property or income.  On the death of a recipient of old age assistance, aid to the needy blind, medicaid for employed adults with disabilities, or aid to the permanently and totally disabled, the total amount of assistance paid under this chapter or RSA 161 shall be allowed as a claim against the estate of such person after payment of the charges in the priority set forth in RSA 554:19.  No lien filed in accordance with RSA 167:14 shall be extended to enforce recovery nor shall any sale be forced against the real estate of a recipient of old age assistance, aid to the needy blind, medicaid for employed adults with disabilities, or aid to the permanently and totally disabled while it is occupied as a home by a surviving spouse.  The federal government shall be entitled, as long as required as a condition to federal financial participation, to such proportion of the net amount collected from the estate of a recipient of old age assistance, aid to the needy blind, medicaid for employed adults with disabilities, or aid to the permanently and totally disabled as the federal participation bears to the total amount of assistance granted said recipient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I, for medical assistance, no resources of the community spouse shall be deemed available to the institutionalized spouse during the continuous period in which an institutionalized spouse is in an institution, and after the month in which an institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible for medical assistance benefits.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It is not cost-effective to recover from an individual's estate;  or

Such notice of lien shall contain the names of the recipient and the recipient's spouse, if any.  All such liens shall continue during the lifetime of the recipient and of the spouse of the recipient, if any, and until enforced as provided in this section, unless sooner released by the commissioner of the department of health and human services.

Whenever a recipient of financial assistance, medical assistance, old age assistance, aid to the needy blind, medicaid for employed adults with disabilities, or aid to the permanently and totally disabled shall have a legally cognizable claim against any person or party for expenses or support and the department of health and human services has already furnished assistance to such recipient, the amount of assistance furnished may be recovered in an action brought in the name of the state from such person or party against whom the recipient has a legally cognizable claim for expenses or support.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The commissioner may recover the amount of medical assistance furnished to a dependent child from the child's responsible parents to the extent authorized under Title XXI of the Social Security Act.  In such cases, the amount of assistance furnished and subject to reimbursement shall include, but not be limited to, expenditures for medical care and health insurance premiums and other expenditures paid by the state for enrollment or other fees for participation in the program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state medical assistance program is the payor of last resort and shall provide medical coverage only when there are no other available resources.  Whenever a recipient of medical assistance shall receive a settlement or an award from a liable third person or party, such recipient shall repay the amount of medical assistance furnished by the state to the extent that the amount of the recovery makes repayment possible.  If a recipient of medical assistance receives a settlement or an award from a third party, the settlement or award is subject to disbursement as provided in paragraphs III-a and IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. The commissioner of health and human services may recover the full amount of medical assistance furnished by the state from the portion of any settlement or judgment reasonably attributable to medical expenses.  The commissioner may waive or reduce the amount due the state for good cause upon written request from a recipient or recipient's attorney.  The acceptance of any waiver or the payment of any reduced amount due shall create a rebuttable presumption that the apportionment was equitable in any action brought pursuant to paragraph IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A disbursement of any award, judgment, or settlement shall not be made to a recipient without the recipient or the recipient's attorney first providing at least 30-days written notice of any scheduled trial, alternative dispute resolution hearing, or settlement to the commissioner of health and human services that the recipient has a claim which could result in a recovery from a third party or obtaining from the commissioner a written release of any obligation owed to the state for medical assistance provided to the recipient.  The commissioner shall notify the recipient or the recipient's attorney of the amount of the commissioner's claim within 21 days of the notice.  If a dispute arises between the recipient and the commissioner of health and human services as to the settlement of any claim that arises under this section, the third party or the recipient's attorney shall withhold from disbursement to the recipient or to any legal instrument created for the benefit of the recipient, an amount equal to the commissioner's claim.  Either party may apply to the superior court or the district court in which an action based upon the recipient's claim could have been commenced for an order to determine an equitable apportionment between the commissioner and the recipient of the amount withheld.  The court shall have broad discretion to apportion the amount withheld as justice may require.  An order of apportionment has the effect of a judgment.  The obligation of a third party under this paragraph to withhold all or part of a disbursement is conditional upon the receipt by the third party of written notice from the commissioner, the recipient, or the recipient's attorney that the commissioner is asserting a claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All property, real or personal, in a revocable trust is subject to recovery by the department for recovery for any medical assistance provided the decedent.  Upon the death of the grantor, the department shall provide the trustee with a statement containing the amount of medical assistance which was provided to the decedent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) For purposes of recovering the costs of medical assistance, the estate of a recipient shall include all property, real or personal, which at the time of a recipient's death was held by the recipient in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, or life estate for all such title or interest established on or after July 1, 2005.  Recovery shall be limited to the value of the recipient's ownership interest and in no case shall such amount exceed the total amount of medical assistance provided to the deceased recipient, nor shall recovery extend to any interest in property, real or personal, for which a non-recipient owner paid fair market value at the time said ownership interest was acquired.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No sooner than 45 days from the death of the recipient, the department shall provide the other joint owner or owners notice of the department's claim.  Written notice shall include a description of all categories of individuals exempt from recovery by reason of familial status as allowed under 42 U.S.C. section 1396p(b)(2) and RSA 167:16-a, IV, as well as the availability and method of requesting a hardship waiver.  Within 30 days of the receipt of notification of the department's claim, the joint owner or owners shall acknowledge receipt of the department's claim and, provided that there shall not be undue hardship imposed upon the surviving joint owner or owners, either tender an amount equal to the deceased recipient's interest in the identified property and/or financial instrument to the state of New Hampshire toward the deceased's medical assistance bill, but such amount shall not exceed the total amount of medical assistance provided to the deceased recipient, or enter into a binding agreement to make such payment as soon as is practicable.  If the joint owner or owners refuse to acknowledge receipt of the department's claim or to tender payment or fail to fulfill the agreement to pay without good cause, as required by this paragraph, the commissioner may bring an action in superior court or probate court, as the case may be, to compel such payment.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted or applied so as to violate RSA 167:16-a or 42 U.S.C. section 1396p(b)(2)(A) and (B) prohibiting recovery when the recipient is survived by a spouse, minor children, or disabled children or when the recipient is survived by either siblings or children under certain circumstances.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Assistance liens arising under this chapter or RSA 161 may be enforced by a bill in equity, or, in the case of liens against real estate which have been duly filed under RSA 167:14, by filing a timely and verified notice of lien with the probate court with jurisdiction over the estate of the recipient and mailing a copy of said notice and a verified claim for recovery of assistance payments to the administrator of the estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may enforce the liquidated amount of an assistance lien against real estate by filing a timely and verified notice with the probate court and submitting a timely and verified claim against the estate of the recipient which sets forth the dates and amounts of assistance paid.  Such claims shall be timely if filed within 6 months from the initial grant of administration for the estate in question.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding RSA 556:5 and any other provision of law to the contrary, the administrator of a recipient's estate shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted a claim for recovery of assistance which is subject to the jurisdiction of the probate court unless, within 12 months from the initial grant of administration, the administrator commences an equitable action in the superior court challenging the validity or amount of the commissioner's claim and lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When a timely notice of lien has been filed with a probate court pursuant to this section, approval of a request to sell real estate or to distribute probate assets shall not occur until and unless the court enters a finding that the assistance claim has been satisfied or the commissioner's lien is otherwise protected.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Counties shall reimburse the state for expenditures for recipients for whom such county is liable who are eligible for nursing home care and are receiving services from a licensed nursing home, or in another New Hampshire setting as an alternative to a licensed nursing home placement and are supported under the Medicaid home and community-based care waiver for the elderly and chronically ill, as such waiver may be amended from time to time, to the extent of 100 percent of the non-federal share of such expenditures.  Expenditures shall not include payments made for skilled care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Counties shall not be liable for Medicaid recipients in state institutions, the Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center, and intermediate care facilities (ICF) approved by the department of health and human services and servicing developmentally impaired persons.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The counties shall have an aggregate credit of $5,000,000 against amounts due under this section for each fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008.  The credit shall be allocated as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) For fiscal year 2009, $4,000,000 shall be allocated among the counties based upon the proportion each paid for such expenditures in the prior fiscal year, and $1,000,000 shall be allocated among the counties based upon their relative proportions of residents age 65 or older who are Medicaid recipients.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For fiscal year 2010, $2,000,000 shall be allocated among the counties based upon the proportion each paid for such expenditures in the prior fiscal year, and $3,000,000 shall be allocated among the counties based upon their relative proportions of residents age 65 or older who are Medicaid recipients.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The credit shall be made available as soon as possible after the start of the fiscal year.  The department shall adopt county credit criteria in consultation with the county-state finance commission and in accordance with the provisions of RSA 541-A.  The total aggregate obligation of the counties shall be reduced by the amount of the credit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For the biennium ending June 30, 2013, the counties shall have an additional credit against the amounts due for long term care expenditures under RSA 167:18-a.  The credit in the amount of $2,498,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 and $2,547,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 shall be in addition to the $5,000,000 annual credit set forth in subparagraph (a).  The additional credit shall be allocated among the counties based on the percentage of total payments each county had for the preceding fiscal year from the nursing facility trust fund under RSA 151-E:15 and shall be made available to the counties as soon as possible after the start of the fiscal year.  The total aggregate obligation of the counties shall be reduced by the amount of the credit in each fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding the procedures of paragraphs I-III of this section, no county shall be liable for total billings in fiscal year 2009 or fiscal year 2010 in an amount which would be greater than the amount of liability projected for that fiscal year using the methodology for determining county payments in former RSA 167:18-a, 167:18-b, and 167:18-f prior to its repeal together with the amount of liability projected for that fiscal year using the repealed methodology for determining county payments in RSA 169-B, 169-C, and 169-D.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:61-c Actions by Attorney General and Private Persons. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The attorney general shall investigate violations under RSA 167:61-b.  If the attorney general finds that a person has violated or is violating RSA 167:61-b, the attorney general may bring a civil action in superior court against the person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II.  (a)  An individual, hereafter referred to as "relator,'' may bring a civil action for a violation of RSA 167:61-b, I on behalf of the relator and for the state.  The action shall be brought in the name of the state against a defendant that (1) has its principal place of business within the state or (2) during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date the action is filed, received reimbursement from the Medicaid program of this state, as defined under RSA 167:63, V, equal to 10 percent or more of the defendant's aggregate reimbursement from all state medical assistance programs governed by Title XIX of the Social Security Act.  No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a relator under this paragraph, and no award shall be paid under RSA 167:61-e, I or V, unless the action satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a relator brings an action under this section, no person other than the state may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the relator possesses shall be served on the state in accordance with the New Hampshire rules of civil procedure.  The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.   The state may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The state may, for good cause shown, move the court for one or more extensions of the 60-day time period during which the complaint shall remain under seal.  Any such motion may be supported by affidavits or other submissions filed under seal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extension obtained, the state shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the relator who initiated the proceeding may conduct the action.  If the state, having elected not to proceed with the action, so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall receive copies of all deposition transcripts.  The court, without limiting the status and rights of the relator, may subsequently permit the state to intervene upon a showing of good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant in accordance with the New Hampshire rules of civil procedure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any provision of RSA 275-E to the contrary, any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.  Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.  An employee may bring an action in the superior court for the relief provided in this paragraph.  For purposes of this paragraph, "employee'' has the same meaning as in RSA 275-E:1, I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:61-d Rights of Parties to Actions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the state proceeds with an action under RSA 167:61-c, the state shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and shall not be bound by an act of the relator bringing the action.  The relator shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the following limitations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The state may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the relator initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing on the motion, that dismissal should be allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The state may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the relator initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances.  Upon a showing of good cause, the hearing may be held in camera.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding RSA 167:61-c, the state may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the state, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil monetary penalty.  If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the relator initiating the action shall have the same rights in the proceeding as the relator would have had if the action had continued under this section.  Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The parties to the action shall receive court approval of any settlements reached.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:61-e Award to Relator. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the state proceeds with an action brought by a relator under RSA 167:61-c, the relator shall, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the relator substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action.  Where the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the relator bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information furnished by the relator and the role of the relator bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation.  Any payment to a relator under this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds.  The relator shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whether or not the state proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a relator who planned and initiated the violation of RSA 167:61-b upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that the relator would otherwise receive under paragraph I, taking into account the role of the relator in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation.  If the relator bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from the relator's role in the violation of RSA 167:61-b, the relator shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action.  The dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the state to continue the action represented by the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under RSA 167:61-c:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Against any department official or any division, board, bureau, commission or agency within the department;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When the relator is a present or former employee of the state and the action is based upon information discovered by the employee during the course of the employee's employment, unless the employee first, in good faith, exhausted any existing internal procedures for reporting and seeking recovery of the falsely claimed sums through official channels and the state failed to act on the information provided within a reasonable period of time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding, in which the state is already a party;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That is based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the relator bringing the action is an original source of the information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The state shall not be liable for expenses or fees, including attorneys' fees, that a relator incurs in bringing an action under RSA 167:61-c and shall not elect to pay those expenses or fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the state does not proceed with an action brought by a relator under RSA 167:61-c, the relator bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount that the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages.  The amount shall not be less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds.  The relator shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs.  All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the state does not proceed with an action brought by a relator under RSA 167:61-c and the relator conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorneys fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established in the state treasury an uncompensated care fund which shall consist of the moneys collected pursuant to RSA 84-A.  Investment earnings of the fund shall be credited to the fund.  Moneys paid into the fund shall be exempt from any state budget reductions, and the commissioner is authorized to expend these funds, together with matching federal funds, as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner may provide reimbursement for uncompensated care costs in accordance with the approved schedule of payments through either Medicaid rate adjustments or disproportionate share hospital payment adjustments, or a combination thereof.  Funds available under this section shall also be used to make medical provider payments and to support the state's Medicaid enhancement tax unrestricted revenue account, in amounts directed by the budget in each year of the biennium.  Expenditure of revenues deposited to the uncompensated care fund shall be made in the following order of priority:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) To support medical provider payments as budgeted in each year of the biennium;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) To ensure that critical access hospitals receive reimbursement for reported uncompensated care costs at the rate of 100 percent of the individual hospital limit or at the highest uniform percentage that available funding would permit should funds be inadequate to cover 100 percent of the hospital limit for disproportionate share payments as determined by the commissioner consistent with the provisions of 42 U.S.C. section 1396r-4(g) and any relevant federal regulations promulgated thereunder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) To support the state's Medicaid enhancement tax unrestricted revenue account as budgeted in each year of the biennium;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If authorized, to reimburse non-critical access hospitals at the highest uniform percentage of each hospital's disproportionate share hospital payment limit as the funds made available under this section permit and are consistent with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. section 1396r-4(g) and any relevant federal regulations promulgated thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner is hereby authorized and directed to develop and implement, in connection with the payment by the state to hospitals for reimbursement of uncompensated care costs, a schedule of payments for reimbursement of the uncompensated care costs of those hospitals that are subject to the tax liability imposed under RSA 84-A and that participate in the state Medicaid program.  The reimbursement of uncompensated care costs paid in state fiscal year 2012 and state fiscal year 2013 shall be in accordance with the schedule of payments to hospitals that takes effect on or after July 1, 2011, subject to the prior review and approval of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and shall be structured in a manner that is consistent with all federal laws and regulations governing (i) Title XIX disproportionate share hospital payment adjustments and other rate payments, (ii) conditions for receiving federal financial participation, and (iii) permissible sources of state financial participation as provided for under 42 C.F.R. part 433 and all other applicable federal regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For purposes of this section, uncompensated care costs shall include:  any charity care cost, and any portion of Medicaid-covered patient care costs unreimbursed by Medicaid payments, that the commissioner determines would meet the criteria under 42 U.S.C. section 1396r-4(g) governing hospital-specific limits on disproportionate share hospital payments under Title XIX of the Social Security Act and the provisions of all federal regulations promulgated thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) One percent of the funds made available for uncompensated care payments shall be placed in a separate class line reserved for the expenses of the department in administering this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Moneys in the uncompensated care fund shall be continually appropriated to the department for the purposes of this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The balance of the moneys remaining in the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall lapse into the general fund.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:67 Findings and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that at least 30,000 New Hampshire children lack health insurance.  The lack of available, comprehensive maternity and child health services imposes a great cost, in both human and financial terms, on the citizens of this state.  Both government and industry have long recognized the need for continual reinvestment in physical plant, public infrastructure, marketing, research and development, but less attention has been paid to the need for investment in our state's human resources.  At a time when growing economic competition makes it essential that New Hampshire have a high quality work force, spending on programs to develop that work force is a necessary investment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. That investment begins with healthy beginnings for children, including early and comprehensive prenatal care and comprehensive primary and preventive child health and developmental services.  Equally important, maternal and child preventive health and child development programs are highly cost effective simply from the perspective of health care and special education cost avoidance.  Studies show that modest investments in preventive programs today will reduce long-term health and welfare spending by the states tomorrow.  Thus, the cost to New Hampshire of not providing adequate access to maternal and child health services can be measured in wasted lives, rising costs of remedial health and social programs, and a work force increasingly unprepared for the challenges of international economic competition.  Recent federal legislation regarding medicaid coverage for low-income pregnant women and children has created an unparalleled opportunity for federal cost sharing in state programs that serve this high risk population.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The purpose of this subdivision is to make a needed and strategic investment in this state's human resources by taking advantage of federally created options to obtain additional federal financial assistance by expanding medicaid eligibility for low income pregnant women and children.  This subdivision also provides for improved outreach and enrollment of medicaid eligible pregnant women and children and improved coordination of medicaid services for pregnant women and children with other publicly-funded programs providing maternal and child health services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:68 Medicaid Enhancement for Children and Pregnant Women. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A which:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Establish by July 1, 1999, categorically needy coverage groups under RSA 167:6, VII and Title XIX of the Social Security Act, sections 1902 (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) and 1902(a)(10)(i)(VII) and establish less restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2) of Title XIX of the Social Security Act as necessary to increase the eligibility level for medicaid coverage to a minimum of 170 percent of the federal poverty level disregarding resources for a family size equal to the size of the family including the woman, infant or child.  This includes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Women during pregnancy and during the 60-day period beginning on the last day of the pregnancy;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Infants under one year of age;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Children who have attained one year of age but have not attained 6 years of age;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Children born after September 30, 1983, who have attained 6 years of age but have not attained 19 years of age;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Children born on or before September 30, 1983, who have not yet attained 19 years of age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Establish by January 1, 1994, procedures in the medical assistance program for improved outreach and enrollment for pregnant women and children.  Such procedures shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Implementing shortened, simplified medicaid-only application forms for the individuals covered under paragraphs I and II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Providing for the receipt and initial processing of medicaid applications from individuals covered under paragraphs I and II at locations which are other than those used for the receipt and processing of applications for aid to families with dependent children and which include providers of Title V Maternal and Child Health Services, Title X Family Planning Services, the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children and Early Intervention program sites, as well as those required under 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(55).  Individuals submitting applications at sites, other than the department of health and human services district offices, shall not be required to subsequently visit the department of health and human services district office to complete the initial eligibility determination process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Instituting a formal procedure for taking maternity-related medical assistance applications at the offices of "qualified providers'' including the providers listed in RSA 167:68, III(b) and for making medicaid services available to a pregnant woman during a "presumptive eligibility period'' as provided in 42 U.S.C. 1396r-1.  Presumptive eligibility shall be made available to pregnant women applying at department of health and human services district offices as well as to pregnant women applying at non-district office sites.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Instituting an aggressive public education campaign regarding the availability of medicaid coverage for maternal and child health services, the existence of other publicly-funded health programs serving mothers and children, and the advantages of preventive health care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Instituting a newborn home visiting program whereby a licensed health professional makes a home visit to targeted households with medicaid covered newborns within 60 days after birth to encourage families to participate in the Early and Periodic, Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment Program, to conduct a health screen, to better link the family with primary health care, and to better ensure continued medicaid coverage for the infant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Establish by January 1, 1994, procedures for improved coordination of the medicaid program for pregnant women and children with other publicly-funded health programs serving mothers and children, including Title V Maternal and Child Health, Title X Family Planning, and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, and the Early Intervention Program.  Such procedures shall include, to the extent permissible by federal law:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A common application form;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Medicaid eligibility technicians located at agencies providing these publicly-funded health care services;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The continuation and completion of rulemaking and other measures designed to make medicaid reimbursement available to these publicly funded health programs for medically necessary case management and care coordination services provided by these agencies to medicaid eligible pregnant women and children.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:77 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this subdivision is to reform welfare through the vehicle made available by the federal government.  To the extent permitted by federal law, it is the intent of the general court to operate the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program through 2 subprograms:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The New Hampshire employment program which shall provide financial assistance for families with dependent children when the children are cared for by a parent or relative who is receiving assistance and is considered to be able-bodied for employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The family assistance program which shall provide financial assistance for families with dependent children when the parent or other relative is considered unable to work due to a physical or mental disability or the children are cared for by a relative other than a parent who is not receiving assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The New Hampshire employment program and the family assistance program are the financial assistance programs upon which Medicaid and Food Stamps are automatically granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other laws to the contrary, the New Hampshire employment program and family assistance program shall be covered by this subdivision and the rules adopted under the authority of this section.  All statutory provisions within RSA 161 and 167 which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this subdivision shall remain in full force and effect and shall apply to the New Hampshire employment program and the family assistance program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The New Hampshire employment program shall promote economic independence and help maintain and strengthen family life by enabling able-bodied persons with dependent children to assume responsibility for their families through the dignity of work.  Work shall be promoted by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Offering employment services, support services, and transitional financial assistance with the expectation that participants move quickly towards employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Developing long-term employment skills that lead to self-sufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Supporting job readiness, life skills, workforce training, and barrier resolution programs with proven records of success in ensuring that employment program clients are truly prepared for the workforce and able to maintain self-sufficiency regardless of whether those programs count towards the federal work participation rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Recognizing the equal responsibility of both parents to provide economic support for their children.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The goals of the New Hampshire employment program shall be to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Eliminate or reduce the harmful effects of poverty on families and children by fostering employment and opportunity as a means to economic independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Assist participants to gain employment as rapidly as possible, given due consideration to individual circumstances, labor market conditions, the needs of the dependent children for continuing care and protection, and the ultimate goal of long-term economic independence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Eliminate the stigma of welfare by promoting a philosophy and perception that the purpose of welfare is to eliminate or reduce the harmful effects of poverty on families and children by promoting work opportunities for all New Hampshire residents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Support and coordinate with activities that promote self-sufficiency and strengthen family life.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Promote successful transition from public assistance through the provision of job readiness activities, training, and education activities concurrently with employment or seeking employment, family support skills, and follow-up services for problem resolution and job advancement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Develop partnerships with employers to create job opportunities and meet the needs of both employers and participants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Provide a program where it is more advantageous to work than not to work by rewarding self-sufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Implement a program that is clear, focused, and simple to administer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The goals of the family assistance program shall be to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Eliminate or reduce the harmful effects of poverty on families and children by providing financial assistance and medical assistance only to families with children in a manner compatible with decency and health.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Promote employment opportunities.

(8) Leaving a job because of circumstances beyond the control of the parent or caretaker relative which render continued employment impracticable, including but not limited to, lack of transportation or child care, or illness, incapacity or disability of the parent or caretaker relative, or illness, incapacity or disability of another household member serious enough to require the presence in the home of the parent or caretaker relative, net loss of cash income, required court appearance, or mandated appointments;  or

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department shall establish a sanction policy for participants who are non-compliant with program requirements.  The goal of the sanction policy shall be to obtain compliance with the work requirements and move the client towards self-sufficiency.  The sanction policy shall establish the timing and occurrence of benefit reduction and termination of the TANF financial assistance case for non-compliance as provided in this paragraph.  No reduction shall be imposed which disregards the needs of the children when the parent or caretaker relative who is out of compliance lacks the means necessary to immediately come into compliance.  The following progression of sanctions shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The initial sanction shall consist of reduction of financial assistance benefits representing the needs of the individual who is out of compliance.  The second level of sanction shall consist of reduction of  1/3 of the adjusted payment standard for the assistance group.  The third level of the sanction shall consist of reduction of  2/3 of the adjusted payment standard for the assistance group.  The initial sanction shall apply for a 2-week period.  The second and third levels of sanction shall each apply for a 4-week period, at the end of which the TANF financial assistance case shall close if the participant remains in noncompliance.  Progressive sanctions shall apply unless and until the participant demonstrates full compliance.  Termination of assistance shall not occur until reasonable efforts for a home visit have been made to ensure that the client was competent to understand the requirement and had the means to come into compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For non-compliance in the employment program or for voluntarily quitting a job as defined in RSA 167:82, III(c), full compliance is demonstrated by completion of verifiable participation in approved employment-related activities for 2 consecutive weeks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For non-compliance in paternity identification or assignment of support, full compliance is demonstrated by fully cooperating in all action necessary to identify and establish paternity or to identify, locate, assign and obtain support.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For non-compliance by a non-deferred dependent child in participation requirements, the initial sanction shall consist of reduction of financial assistance in the amount established to meet the needs of the dependent child.  The benefit reduction shall continue for the duration of the non-compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) For all sanctions, the reduction period shall apply to the period immediately following the determination of non-compliance.  A determination of non-compliance shall be made within 10 business days of an act of non-compliance, barring a finding of good cause.  The participant shall be allowed 2 weeks from the date of benefit reduction to demonstrate full compliance.  No sanction shall be imposed on a household unless the participant who is out of compliance has received prior written notice of the reason for the reduction of assistance and the specific actions which must be taken in order to reinstate full assistance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A participant, other than a non-deferred dependent child, who is in sanction status for a cumulative period of 3 months over a 12-month period shall have his or her TANF case closed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) For a TANF financial assistance case that closes in sanction status, in the event of reapplication for financial assistance at a later time, the participant shall demonstrate full compliance before the TANF financial assistance case may be processed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Participants shall be eligible for medical assistance as categorically needy provided they receive financial assistance under this subdivision, or are otherwise eligible to receive such assistance but do not.  An assistance group that becomes ineligible due to new or increased earnings shall remain eligible for medical assistance for 12 months from when the assistance group became ineligible pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) Financial assistance payments shall be based on the characteristics of the assistance group under this section and the standard of need and payment standard as authorized in RSA 167:7, II.  The financial assistance grant is the difference between the assistance group's net income and the payment standard.  The financial assistance payments may be contingent on the performance of program activities and may be made after the performance of such program activities.  The following disregards and deductions shall be allowed in determining net income:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An applicant earned income disregard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A participant earned income disregard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A deduction for all amounts actually paid by the assistance group for court-ordered payments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A deduction for amounts actually paid for child care expenses not to exceed the applicable rate as determined by the department by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Any other disregard or deduction established by the department by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A as necessary to promote the purpose and goals of this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The department may establish the amount of the earned income disregard or any other disregard or deduction by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. When the department has made a final determination that a parent or caretaker relative, without good cause, has failed to comply with employment program work requirements under RSA 167:85, and assistance to the household has been reduced or closed pursuant to RSA 167:82, III(c)-(e) or IV(a), the amount of reduction shall be a qualified state assistance reduction.  The reduction or closure shall remain a qualified state assistance reduction for so long as the parent or caretaker relative is a New Hampshire employment program recipient and maintains the present ability to cure the reduction by complying with employment program work requirements.  The department shall provide advance notice to the parent or caretaker relative of the amount and effective date of the qualified state assistance reduction or closure and that a city or town may consider the amount as deemed income for purposes of calculating eligibility for and the amount of general assistance.  Upon request, the department, in a timely manner, shall make available to the welfare administrator of any city or town information as to the existence and amount of any qualified state assistance reduction or closure or denial that has been imposed on any person applying for assistance from that municipality.  Such reporting shall be in accordance with a confidentiality agreement executed between the department and the New Hampshire Local Welfare Administrators Association and in a manner sufficient to enable the tracking of any additional municipal cost which may result from the qualified assistance reduction, closure, or denial.

I. For the purposes of RSA 281-A, an employment program participant is an employee of both the state and the sponsor.  In the event that it is determined that the participant has been subject to an injury or occupational disease producing a disability arising out of and in the course of participation in the employment program, the program shall not provide compensation pursuant to RSA 281-A:28, 281-A:28-a, 281-A:31, and 281-A:31-a, but the participant shall receive benefits from the employment program while otherwise eligible, or compensation equivalent to those benefits if the participant becomes ineligible for benefits under RSA 167.  When determining the amount of compensation provided pursuant to RSA 281-A:32 for a scheduled permanent impairment award, the amount of compensation shall be calculated by using the minimum wage at the time of injury multiplied by the average number of hours worked per week or the number of hours agreed to by the program and the participant, whichever is higher.
