&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:3 Compelling Support. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon the request of the commissioner of health and human services, any such father, mother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, husband or wife shall provide the support of the person assisted under this chapter or RSA 161, or contribute thereto.  Should such relative refuse to comply with such request, the commissioner of health and human services may bring an appropriate proceeding in the superior court in the name of the state to compel such support or contribution thereto.  If upon hearing it shall appear that such relative is able to provide the support of such person or to contribute thereto, the court shall enter an order accordingly and shall fix the amount and method and manner of payment.  Failure to comply with any such order, without good cause as determined by the court at a hearing, shall be deemed contempt of court and punished accordingly.  Such proceedings shall be brought by the attorney general or the county attorney for the county in which any such relative resides when so requested by the commissioner of health and human services.
