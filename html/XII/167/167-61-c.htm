&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:61-c Actions by Attorney General and Private Persons. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The attorney general shall investigate violations under RSA 167:61-b.  If the attorney general finds that a person has violated or is violating RSA 167:61-b, the attorney general may bring a civil action in superior court against the person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) An individual, hereafter referred to as "relator,'' may bring a civil action for a violation of RSA 167:61-b, I on behalf of the relator and for the state.  The action shall be brought in the name of the state against a defendant that (1) has its principal place of business within the state or (2) during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date the action is filed, received reimbursement from the Medicaid program of this state, as defined under RSA 167:63, V, equal to 10 percent or more of the defendant's aggregate reimbursement from all state medical assistance programs governed by Title XIX of the Social Security Act.  No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a relator under this paragraph, and no award shall be paid under RSA 167:61-e, I or V, unless the action satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a relator brings an action under this section, no person other than the state may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the relator possesses shall be served on the state in accordance with the New Hampshire rules of civil procedure.  The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.   The state may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The state may, for good cause shown, move the court for one or more extensions of the 60-day time period during which the complaint shall remain under seal.  Any such motion may be supported by affidavits or other submissions filed under seal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extension obtained, the state shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the relator who initiated the proceeding may conduct the action.  If the state, having elected not to proceed with the action, so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall receive copies of all deposition transcripts.  The court, without limiting the status and rights of the relator, may subsequently permit the state to intervene upon a showing of good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant in accordance with the New Hampshire rules of civil procedure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any provision of RSA 275-E to the contrary, any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.  Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.  An employee may bring an action in the superior court for the relief provided in this paragraph.  For purposes of this paragraph, "employee'' has the same meaning as in RSA 275-E:1, I.
