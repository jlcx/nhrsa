&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 167:77-a Work Participation Rates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department shall make strong efforts to meet the work participation rate requirements of the federal TANF program, as amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Efforts may include the following actions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Using state funds not claimed as maintenance of effort for the federal TANF program to provide benefits for categories of families who are exempt from the state's work activity requirements or who have good cause reasons for not participating.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Developing a diversion program for applicants for the employment program for up to 4 months to provide enhanced assessment and job placement services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Making a claim for additional caseload reduction credits based on state spending above the minimum to meet the federal TANF maintenance of effort requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Assigning participants into work activities that count toward the federal work participation rate where alternative activities are not better suited to assist the participant to enter, re-enter, and maintain employment and move toward self-sufficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Providing continuing assistance to participants who are meeting the hour requirements in an unsubsidized job, as specified in RSA 167:85, VIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall submit a report to the oversight committee for health and human services, established in RSA 126-A:13, relative to actions taken to increase the work participation rate reported to the federal Department of Health and Human Services.  The department also shall provide the oversight committee with an estimate of whether the state shall meet the federal requirements for each federal fiscal year by July 15 of that fiscal year.
