&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 160-C:3 Requirements for the Sale of Permissible Fireworks. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who desires to sell permissible fireworks shall apply to the municipality in which the permissible fireworks are to be sold.  Such application shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner.  The licensing board of any municipality or, if one does not exist, the governing body may issue a permit to sell permissible fireworks to a person who applies, provided that the person has a valid permit for the sale of fireworks issued pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code.  No permit to sell permissible fireworks shall be issued by the governing body without the prior approval of the police chief, fire chief, and building inspector, if any, of the municipality.  The municipality may charge a fee for the permit or application for permit under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After the person has obtained a municipal permit to sell permissible fireworks, the person may apply for a state license to sell permissible fireworks.  Upon application of any person, the commissioner or designee may issue a license authorizing the applicant to sell or market permissible fireworks in this state, provided the person has first obtained a permit to sell fireworks pursuant to RSA 160-C:3, I.  The license shall bear the name, address, description, and signature of the licensee.  The license shall be displayed at all times, openly and publicly, at the licensee's place of business.  The license shall be valid for not more than one year from the date of issue and may be renewed on May 1 of the following year.  The initial license fee shall be pro-rated to correspond with the initial date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Persons seeking a state license shall file an application with the commissioner which is in such form and contains such information as the commissioner may establish by rule, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-b. Only individuals lawfully residing in the United States, or partnerships or limited liability companies organized under the laws of this state or authorized to transact business within the state, or corporations organized under the laws of one of the United States and currently registered to do business in New Hampshire shall be licensed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-c. All license applications shall be made in the name of the proposed licensee and shall be signed and sworn to by the proposed licensee.  In the case of a partnership, limited liability company, or corporate applicant, the application shall be signed and sworn to by all partners or an officer of the proposed licensee, or in the case of a limited liability company by each member if a natural person, or by a duly appointed representative of the membership if any other person, or by the manager of the limited liability company who must submit a copy of the written authorization of the limited liability company membership to sign the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-d. An applicant intending to employ a trade name in the proposed business shall submit evidence with its application which demonstrates that the trade name is currently registered in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-e. A separate license application shall be filed with respect to each place of business sought by a single licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-f. The commissioner shall receive and evaluate sufficient information to identify and to evaluate the qualification of all persons with the de jure or de facto right to control the operations and policies of the proposed licensee.  Among other things, license applications shall disclose fully and accurately:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The applicant's identity, the applicant's permanent residence address in the case of an individual, and the applicant's principal place of business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The names and addresses of any persons who own or have the right to control an interest in the proposed licensee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any agency agreement or other contract between the applicant and third persons intended to affect the operation of the proposed business, and the identity of the third party involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The applicant's other business interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The name, location, physical layout, and nature of the proposed business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) All licenses issued to and all other license applications filed by the applicant and its principal owners pursuant to this chapter during the previous 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The name and address of the actual manager of the proposed business and his or her qualifications to perform such work.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-g. Corporate applicants shall disclose the names and permanent addresses of all directors, officers, and shareholders, except that corporations with more than 20 shareholders may disclose only those persons owning or controlling 5 percent or more of the outstanding shares.  Limited liability company applicants shall disclose the names and permanent addresses of all members.  Partnership applicants shall disclose the names and addresses of all partners, except that partnerships with more than 20 partners may disclose only those persons who are managing partners and those persons who own or control a partnership share of 5 percent of more.  If the principal controlling shareholders, members, or partners are themselves owned or controlled by other persons, then the information required by this paragraph shall also be furnished for each such person until the person or persons with the ultimate legal right to control the applicant's proposed business have been fully identified.  No license shall be issued under this section to any person who has been convicted of a felony, or to any partnership, limited liability company, or corporation when a partner, director, officer, member, or any other person with a controlling interest in the operation of the business has been convicted of a felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-h. The commissioner shall not issue a license under this section unless the commissioner is satisfied that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The application is complete in all respects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The applicant, and any principal controlling owners, directors, or natural persons who are members of any business entity, or officers disclosed pursuant to paragraphs II-f and II-g, are at least 21 years of age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the case of corporate, limited liability company, or partnership applicants controlled by persons who do not reside in the United States, the proposed business would not be managed in a manner which would unduly hinder the commissioner from exercising the commissioner's regulatory responsibilities.  Inaccessibility of relevant records or unresponsiveness to inquiries which result from foreign control shall be grounds for revoking or suspending a license which has already been granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state license may be issued to an applicant who, at the time such license is issued, possesses a permit issued in accordance with the provisions of Title 18, United States Code, governing fireworks, and a permit issued pursuant to RSA 160-C:3, I.  No license shall be issued for the sale of permissible fireworks unless the applicant establishes that it will locate its business in a permanent structure which meets all applicable fire safety codes, building codes, zoning codes, and the requirements of local ordinances.  No license for the sale of permissible fireworks shall be issued to any person who has been convicted of any offense involving fireworks or explosives within the 2-years prior to the application or who has been found to have violated any fireworks or explosives laws, rules, or regulations within the 2 years prior to the application.  No license shall be issued to any person under 21 years of age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Buildings used for the sale of permissible fireworks shall be dedicated solely to the sale and storage of permissible fireworks and items relating to the sale and promotion of fireworks provided for in rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the state fire code adopted pursuant to RSA 153:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the application for a state license is denied, the reasons for such denial shall be stated in writing, in duplicate, the original of which shall be delivered to the applicant, and the copy thereof kept in the office of the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-a. Any applicant denied a license under this chapter shall be granted a hearing by the commissioner, upon the applicant's request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The fee for a license for each location shall be $1,500 per year, payable annually to the department of safety for deposit into the fire standards and training and emergency medical services fund established in RSA 21-P:12-d for the purpose of funding the fireworks inspection program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. No person under the age of 21 shall be engaged in the business of handling or selling any permissible fireworks;  provided, however, that a person less than 21 years of age but at least 18 years of age may handle and sell permissible fireworks at a licensed sales location if he or she is under the direct supervision of a person 21 years of age or older.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
