&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A donor is not a parent of a child conceived through assisted reproduction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a child is conceived via assisted reproduction after the death of the person referenced in paragraph II, consent to assisted reproduction shall be deemed valid only if the person had consented in writing prior to death that if assisted reproduction were to occur after death, the deceased individual would be a parent of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the attempted marriage could be declared invalid only by a court, the child is born during the attempted marriage, or within 300 days after its termination for any reason;  or
