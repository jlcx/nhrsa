&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 168-B:10 Enforceability of Gestational Carrier Agreement.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
To best protect all parties entering into a gestational carrier arrangement, a gestational carrier agreement shall meet the minimum requirements under RSA 168-B:11.  A gestational carrier agreement that conforms to these requirements is a legal contract that is presumed to be valid and enforceable and is legally enforceable by the court.  The parties to a gestational carrier agreement may petition the court for an order affirming the status of a gestational carrier agreement.  The court shall issue such an order upon a finding that the agreement meets the minimum requirements under RSA 168-B:11.
