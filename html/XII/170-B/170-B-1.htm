&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 170-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court hereby declares its conviction that the policies and procedures for adoption contained in this chapter are necessary and desirable, having as their purpose the threefold protection of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The adoptive child, from unnecessary separation from the child's birth parents and from adoption by parents who should not have such responsibility.  This protection also includes the protection of the child from a birth parent attempting to surrender his or her parental rights and responsibilities without a pending legitimate adoption of the child first being filed with the court or in the case of an adoption facilitated by the department or an agency, without an adoption first being contemplated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The birth parent or parents, from hurried and coerced decisions to give up the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The adoptive parent or parents and ensuring them an undisturbed relationship with the child from and after the date of adoption.
