&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 170-B:24 Requests for Identifying and Non-Identifying Information. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Requests for non-identifying social or medical information shall be handled in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Requests for non-identifying social or medical information may be made by an adoptee over the age of 18;  a parent of an adoptee under the age of 18;  or a birth parent of an adoptee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When any of the above listed people submits a request for non-identifying social or medical information, the department or agency shall disclose such information relating to the adoptee, the birth parents, or the blood relatives.  The department or the agency shall delete any information from the health history or background which would tend to be identifying.  Court approval is not required for information disclosed under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the parties mutually agree to the release of identifying information, it shall be released as provided in this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Only the following people may sign a written release authorizing the department or licensed child-placing agency to disclose identifying information about an adoptee, a birth parent, or a blood relative:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An adoptee over the age of 18 may sign a release to authorize disclosure of identifying information as provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The adoptive parents of an adoptee under the age of 18 may also sign a release to authorize disclosure of identifying information as provided in this section.  However, said release shall become void when the adoptee reaches the age of 18.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A birth parent of an adoptee may sign a release authorizing disclosure of identifying information as provided in this section at the time of surrender or later.  A separate release shall be signed by each birth parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any release made pursuant to this section may be revoked or amended at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person signing the release of information or its revocation shall file a copy of such release or revocation with the department or licensed child-placing agency conducting the assessment under RSA 170-B:18, if any.  The department or licensed child-placing agency shall then file a copy of the release with the court in which the adoption petition was filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The release of information shall contain the social security number of the person signing the release.  The social security number shall be used only for purposes of locating that person and shall not be otherwise disclosed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When the department or agency involved in the adoption receives a request for identifying information where a release has been signed and not previously revoked, the department or agency shall attempt to contact the person who signed the release to reaffirm that person's desire to be contacted.  If the person reaffirms his or her desire to be contacted or the department or agency cannot locate the person who signed the release or if the person is deceased, the department or agency shall disclose identifying information to the person who requested it.  Court approval is not required for information disclosed under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) When the department or agency involved in the adoption receives a request for identifying information where no release has been signed or the previously signed release has been revoked, the department or agency may, after review of its records, attempt to contact the person whose identity is sought, to ascertain if they desire to release identifying information.  If the person whose identity is sought, and the person seeking identifying information agree to the release of identifying information, the department or agency shall release it.  Court approval is not required for information released under this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Court approval shall be required prior to the release of identifying information in the following cases:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the parties do not agree, or if they cannot be contacted, or if the department or agency questions the safety of releasing information pursuant to paragraph II, the requesting party or the department or agency may petition the court having jurisdiction for the release of identifying information.  The department or agency shall file a report of the department or agency's action with the court.  The court shall on its own motion or on request of any party hold a hearing on the issue of releasing identifying information.  The department or agency involved shall receive notice of the hearing and be entitled to participate in any hearing under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For all other requests for identifying information under this section, court approval shall be required.  The court shall request a review of the record and the facts of the request from the department or agency involved in the adoption.  The court may hold a hearing on the issue of releasing identifying information.  The department or agency involved shall receive notice of such hearings and be entitled to participate in any hearing under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person violating this section or RSA 170-B:23 shall, if a natural person, be guilty of a misdemeanor, and any other person shall be guilty of a felony.
