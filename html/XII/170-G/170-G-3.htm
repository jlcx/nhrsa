I. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There shall be an administrator for each of the bureaus of the department established by RSA 170-G:2 to administer the laws and rules relative to his respective bureau, subject to the supervision of the commissioner.  The administrator of each bureau within the department shall be a full-time classified employee and shall be appointed in accordance with the rules adopted by the director of personnel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall hire such other employees necessary to perform the work of the department in accordance with rules adopted by the director of personnel.  The number of juvenile probation and parole officers hired shall be consistent with the workload formula established by administrative rule pursuant to RSA 541-A and available funding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner of health and human services may transfer appropriations and personnel of the department in accordance with state procedures and the rules of the director of personnel for the purposes of carrying out the duties of the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may assign the powers and duties of the department to the individual bureaus of the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner shall have authority, after consultation with the insurance department and the risk management unit, and in accordance with the procedures established by the commissioner of administrative services under RSA 21-I:7-c, V, to purchase insurance coverage for the benefit of individuals providing foster care to children within the jurisdiction of the department.  The amount and nature of this insurance coverage may vary in the discretion of the commissioner of administrative services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) Any amounts appropriated for foster parents' defense expenses shall be used for the following purposes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) To pay claims made in writing to the department by foster parents who have suffered property damage which was caused by foster children placed in the claimant's care by the department to the extent that such damage is not covered by insurance coverage or other sources of indemnification and in no event to exceed $500 per claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) To pay claims made in writing to the department by foster parents who have suffered personal injury to themselves or other immediate family members under their care which was caused by foster children placed in the claimant's care by the department to the extent that such damage is not covered by insurance coverage or other sources of indemnification and in no event to exceed $1,000 per claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) To pay legal defense expenses of foster parents who are named as defendants in judicial proceedings in which liability is based in whole or in part upon the alleged negligent performance of duties or responsibilities associated with the care of a foster child placed with the defendant by the department.  Only legal defense expenses shall be paid under this subparagraph, and no funds shall be available for the settlement or compromise of claims or payment of judgments, provided that in no event shall more than $10,000 be expended for the defense of any single action or group of related actions brought against a foster parent.  Claims for payment of legal defense expenses shall be in writing and shall cover only expenses incurred after the claim has been approved and the attorney general has designated the legal counsel who will undertake the defense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No payment shall be made under subparagraph (a)(1) or (2) unless the department investigates the claim and the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, recommends to the risk management unit that the claim, or some portion of the claim, be paid.  If the risk management unit determines that the claim meets the requirements of this paragraph and is reasonable in amount, the commissioner of administrative services, or the commissioner's designee, shall authorize such payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No payment shall be made under subparagraph (a)(3) unless the department investigates the claim and the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee determines the foster parent did not act intentionally, willfully or recklessly, and recommends to the risk management unit that the claim, or some portion of the claim, be paid.  If the risk management unit determines that the claim meets the requirements of this subparagraph, the attorney general shall be notified and shall select a qualified attorney to provide legal representation and defense to the claimant subject to the dollar limitations of subparagraph (a)(3), the recommendations of the risk management unit, and the attorney general's own experience and expertise.  The commissioner of administrative services, or the commissioner's designee, shall authorize payment of such amounts as are approved by the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The commissioner, the commissioner of administrative services, and the attorney general shall have authority to adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, for the proper implementation of their responsibilities under this paragraph.
