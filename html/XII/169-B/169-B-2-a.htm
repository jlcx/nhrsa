&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In each case brought pursuant to this chapter, on the date of the arraignment, the court shall identify the parent or parents of the minor or, in their absence, the guardian or other person charged by law with the responsibility for the welfare of the minor.  It shall be the obligation of such parent or guardian to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Personally attend and assure the attendance of the minor at all hearings of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Personally attend and assure the attendance of the minor at all meetings with the department of health and human services and collateral support service agencies occasioned by the action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Fully participate in all services ordered by the court including, but not limited to, substance abuse treatment, parenting classes, mediation, diversion, and community service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Pay a portion, or all, of any restitution or fines imposed by the court or court approved diversion program fees, when the court finds the payment by the parent to be in the interest of justice and rehabilitation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Supervise the minor's compliance with all orders of the court and conditions of release and probation including, but not limited to, curfew, school attendance and general behavior.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Failure to supervise and otherwise accept responsibility as required by this section may be treated as criminal contempt of court punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and 90 days' imprisonment.  It shall be a defense to any such charge of contempt that the parent, guardian or such other person or persons having custody and control of the minor made reasonable efforts to comply.
