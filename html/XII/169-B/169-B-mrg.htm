<center><h3>Section 169-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:1 Applicability of Chapter, Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
This chapter shall apply to delinquent children as defined in RSA 169-B:2.  This chapter shall be liberally interpreted, construed and administered to effectuate the following purposes and policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To encourage the wholesome moral, mental, emotional, and physical development of each minor coming within the provisions of this chapter, by providing the protection, care, treatment, counselling, supervision, and rehabilitative resources which such minor needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Consistent with the protection of the public interest, to promote the minor's acceptance of personal responsibility for delinquent acts committed by the minor, encourage the minor to understand and appreciate the personal consequences of such acts, and provide a minor who has committed delinquent acts with counseling, supervision, treatment, and rehabilitation and make parents aware of the extent if any to which they may have contributed to the delinquency and make them accountable for their role in its resolution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To achieve the foregoing purposes and policies, whenever possible, by keeping a minor in contact with the home community and in a family environment by preserving the unity of the family and separating the minor and parents only when it is clearly necessary for the minor's welfare or the interests of public safety and when it can be clearly shown that a change in custody and control will plainly better the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. To provide effective judicial procedures through which the provisions of this chapter are executed and enforced and which recognize and enforce the constitutional and other rights of the parties and assures them a fair hearing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:2 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Adult lock-up or jail'' means a locked facility, used primarily to house adults charged with or convicted of violating criminal law.  This includes police lock-ups, county correctional facilities, and any facility used by county sheriffs, state police, or local police to securely detain adult offenders and accused offenders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Alternative to secure detention'' means any local program, approved by the court, police, probation, or the department of health and human services, which offers a less restrictive alternative to secure detention for minors.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, youth attender, crisis home placement, group homes which have entered into agreements with the department of health and human services to provide such care, truant and runaway programs, and alcohol and drug detoxification programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Court'' means the district court, unless otherwise indicated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. "Custody'' means a legal status created by court order wherein the department of health and human services has placement and care responsibility for the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Delinquent'' means a person who has committed an offense before reaching the age of 17 years which would be a felony or misdemeanor under the criminal code of this state if committed by an adult, and is expressly found to be in need of counselling, supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation as a consequence thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. "Diversion'' means a decision made by a person with authority which results in specific official action of the legal system not being taken or being postponed in regard to a juvenile and, in lieu of such inaction or postponement, providing an individually designed program for delivery of services for the juvenile by a specific provider or a plan to assist the juvenile in finding a remedy for his or her inappropriate behavior.  The goal of diversion is to prevent further involvement of the juvenile in the formal legal system.  Diversion of a juvenile may take place either at prefiling as an alternative to the filing of a petition, or at arraignment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-b. "Court approved diversion program'' means a program that has been approved by the administrative judge of the judicial branch family division and has been approved to accept court referrals.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-c. "Intervention'' means a decision made by a person with authority which results in specific official action of the legal system not being taken or being postponed in regard to a juvenile and, in lieu of such inaction or postponement, providing an individually designed program for delivery of services for the juvenile by a specific provider or a plan to assist the juvenile in finding a remedy for his or her inappropriate behavior.  The goal of intervention is to prevent further involvement of the juvenile in the formal legal system.  Intervention for a juvenile may take place either at the adjudicatory or dispositional level.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Detention'' means the care of a minor in physically restricted facilities and shall not include placement at residential treatment or evaluation facilities, staff-secure shelter facilities, or foster care homes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. "Home detention'' means court-ordered confinement of a minor with the parents or other specified home for 24 hours a day unless otherwise prescribed by written court order, under which the minor is permitted out of the residence only at such hours and in the company of persons specified in the court order establishing the home detention.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Minor'' means a person under the age of 17.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Non-secure detention'' means the care of a minor in a facility where physical restriction of movement or activity is provided solely through facility staff.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Conditional release'' means a legal status created by court order following an adjudication that a minor is delinquent and shall be permitted to remain in the community, including the minor's home, subject to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The conditions and limitations of the minor's conduct prescribed by the court;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Such counselling and treatment as deemed necessary, pursuant to methods and conditions prescribed by the court, for the minor and family;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. "Concurrent plan'' means an alternate permanency plan in the event that a child cannot be safely reunified with his or her parents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. "Out-of-home placement'' means when a minor, as the result of a delinquent petition, is removed from a biological parent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of the minor and placed in substitute care with someone other than a biological parent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian.  Such substitute care may include placement with a custodian, guardian, relative, friend, group home, crisis home, shelter care, or a foster home.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Permanency hearing'' means a court hearing for a minor in an out-of-home placement to review, modify, and/or implement the permanency plan or adopt the concurrent plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. "Permanency plan'' means a plan for a minor in an out-of-home placement that is adopted by the court and that provides for timely reunification, termination of parental rights or parental surrender when an adoption is contemplated, guardianship with a fit and willing relative or another appropriate party, or another planned permanent living arrangement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:2-a Parental Responsibility. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In each case brought pursuant to this chapter, on the date of the arraignment, the court shall identify the parent or parents of the minor or, in their absence, the guardian or other person charged by law with the responsibility for the welfare of the minor.  It shall be the obligation of such parent or guardian to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Personally attend and assure the attendance of the minor at all hearings of the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Personally attend and assure the attendance of the minor at all meetings with the department of health and human services and collateral support service agencies occasioned by the action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Fully participate in all services ordered by the court including, but not limited to, substance abuse treatment, parenting classes, mediation, diversion, and community service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Pay a portion, or all, of any restitution or fines imposed by the court or court approved diversion program fees, when the court finds the payment by the parent to be in the interest of justice and rehabilitation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Supervise the minor's compliance with all orders of the court and conditions of release and probation including, but not limited to, curfew, school attendance and general behavior.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Failure to supervise and otherwise accept responsibility as required by this section may be treated as criminal contempt of court punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and 90 days' imprisonment.  It shall be a defense to any such charge of contempt that the parent, guardian or such other person or persons having custody and control of the minor made reasonable efforts to comply.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:4 Jurisdiction Over Certain Persons. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court shall have jurisdiction over any minor with respect to whom a petition is filed under this chapter after the minor's seventeenth and before the minor's eighteenth birthday for an alleged delinquency offense committed before the minor's seventeenth birthday.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may retain jurisdiction over any minor during the period after the minor's seventeenth birthday as justice may require for any minor who, prior to the minor's seventeenth birthday, was adjudicated delinquent and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For whom the department has recommended extension of the court's jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Who has, prior to the minor's seventeenth birthday, consented to the court's retention of jurisdiction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Who is attending school for the purpose of obtaining a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma and is considered likely to receive such diploma.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At the request of the prosecutor or the department, the court may retain jurisdiction over the minor for a period of up to 2 years following the completion of any appeal if the petition was filed after the minor had attained the age of 16 years.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 169-B:19, III, when jurisdiction is retained pursuant to this section, the court may sentence a person to the county correctional facility for a term that may extend beyond the person's eighteenth birthday.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court shall close the case when the minor reaches age 17 or, if jurisdiction is extended pursuant to paragraph II, when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The minor revokes the minor's consent in writing and such revocation has been approved by the court;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The minor ceases to be enrolled as a full-time student during sessions of the school;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The minor graduates from high school or receives a general equivalency diploma;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The minor attains 21 years of age;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The department revokes its consent in writing;  whichever event shall first occur.  The court shall approve the minor's revocation of consent if it finds that the minor, in seeking to do so, is acting intelligently, knowledgeably, and in acceptance of the legal consequences.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding paragraph III, when the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that closing the case would endanger the safety of the minor, any other person, or the community, or the court finds that there is a high probability that continued provision of treatment services is necessary to rehabilitate the minor, the court may retain jurisdiction over any minor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Who has been found to have committed a violent crime as defined under RSA 169-B:35-a, I(c);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Who has been petitioned to the court on 4 or more occasions and adjudicated delinquent in 4 separate adjudicatory hearings which alleged misdemeanor or felony offenses;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court prior to the minor's seventeenth birthday and for whom the department has filed a motion with the court requesting that the court retain jurisdiction under this subparagraph;  provided that the department's motion is filed within the 90 days prior to the minor's seventeenth birthday and provided further that the court's jurisdiction pursuant to this subparagraph shall continue until the minor's eighteenth birthday.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A minor may be subject to the extended jurisdiction of the court for a period of time no longer than that for which an adult could be committed for a like offense or the minor reaches the age of 21, whichever occurs first.  For purposes of this section, the time shall be calculated from the date of the original dispositional order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In any instance in which the statute of limitations has not tolled and no juvenile petition has been filed based upon acts committed before the minor's seventeenth birthday, the state may proceed against the person in the criminal justice system after that person's eighteenth birthday.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(e) When a dispositional order is extended beyond the minor's seventeenth birthday, the court may enforce its order with a finding of criminal contempt.  Notwithstanding RSA 169-B:35, the state may utilize any relevant portion of a juvenile's records in a criminal contempt proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the court retains jurisdiction over the minor pursuant to RSA 169-B:4, V, and the court has determined that the minor is required to register as a sexual offender or offender against children pursuant to RSA 169-B:19, I(k), the minor shall continue to register pursuant to RSA 651-B;  provided, the court retains jurisdiction over the case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-b. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a minor over whom the court has exercised jurisdiction pursuant to RSA 169-B:4, I or retained jurisdiction pursuant to RSA 169-B:4, V(c), may be committed or continue to be committed at the youth development center pursuant to RSA 169-B:19, I(j) until the minor's eighteenth birthday.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-c. (a) A minor who meets the criteria for commitment to an adult correctional facility pursuant to RSA 169-B:4, RSA 169-B:19, III, or RSA 169-B:19, III-a, and whose disposition includes an order of conditional release extending beyond the juvenile's age of majority, or suspended, deferred, or imposed incarceration at an adult correctional facility shall not be committed without first being afforded the right to a jury trial or waiving the right to a jury trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any minor sentenced after a contested adjudicatory hearing to an order of conditional release extending beyond the juvenile's age of majority or suspended, deferred, or imposed incarceration at an adult correctional facility may, after the disposition is issued, request a de novo trial before a jury.  To obtain a de novo jury trial under this chapter, the juvenile shall file a written request in the clerk's office within 3 days of the dispositional order.  A copy of the written request shall also be provided to the local prosecutor and the county attorney.  The request shall be given priority on the court's calendar.  Whenever possible, any such hearing shall be held in a district court building equipped with jury capability.  It shall be conducted by a district court judge specially assigned by the administrative judge of the district court.  The jury panel shall be chosen from the jury pool of the superior court serving the county in which the court is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The court in which the petition originated shall retain jurisdiction over all matters and orders pertaining to the placement, supervision and treatment of the juvenile during the pendency of the pre-trial and trial proceedings.  The request for jury trial shall not suspend any provisions of the original court's order regarding placement, supervision, evaluation, or treatment.  All other orders shall be vacated pending the de novo jury trial.  The judge assigned to conduct the jury trial shall have authority to preside over the jury trial, decide trial management issues, and rule on all pre-trial and post-trial adjudicatory findings.  In the event the juvenile waives the right to jury trial after the case has been specially assigned, the case shall be returned to the court in which the petition originated for continued action pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the event the jury returns a finding of not true on all charges, the dispositional order in its entirety shall be vacated.  In the event the jury returns a finding of true on one or more of the charges, the trial judge shall review and may reinstate or modify only those portions of the dispositional order made by the originating court suspended under this section during the pendency of the de novo process.  In all other respects, the original dispositional order shall remain in effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The provisions of RSA 169-B:34 through 169-B:38, relating to confidentiality of proceedings and records, shall apply to all de novo trials conducted pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A summary of the investigative officer's report shall accompany each commitment order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All dispositional orders issued pursuant to this section shall include written findings as to the basis for the disposition, and such conditions as the court may determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A minor committed to the youth development center for the remainder of minority may be placed at any facility certified by the commissioner of the department of health and human services for the commitment of minors.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall be responsible for notifying the court, within 5 business days, of any such placement and of any subsequent changes in placement made within 60 days of the original placement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the judge orders services, placements or programs different from the recommendations of the department, the judge shall include a statement of the costs of services, placements and programs so ordered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. When a dispositional order places a minor in an out-of-home placement pursuant to RSA 169-B:19, I(e) or (f), prior to concluding the dispositional hearing the court shall set a date for a permanency hearing pursuant to RSA 169-B:31-a, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Prior to any placement which will require educational services outside the minor's home school district, the court shall notify the school district and give the district the opportunity to send a representative to the hearing at which such placement is contemplated.  At such hearing the court shall consider the recommendations of the school district and if such an out-of-district placement is ordered the court shall make written findings that describe the reasons for the placement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The court may issue such orders as are necessary to ensure provision of services under this chapter, provided that any order issued involving the department of education or a legally liable school district shall comply with RSA 169-B:22.

I. Any court, finding that a minor has committed the alleged offense may, before making a final disposition, order the minor, minor's parents, guardian, or person with custody or control to submit to a mental health or substance abuse evaluation to be completed within 60 days.  Any substance abuse evaluation of the parent guardian, or person having custody of the child shall be conducted by a provider contracted with the bureau of substance abuse services, or a provider paid by the parent, guardian, or person having custody of the child.  The cost of such evaluation shall be paid by private insurance, if available, or otherwise by the person undergoing the evaluation, to whom the evaluation shall be provided free or at reduced cost if the person is of limited means.  A written report of the evaluation shall be given to the court before the dispositional hearing.  If the parents, guardian, minor, or person having custody or control objects to the mental health or substance abuse evaluation, they shall object in writing to the court having jurisdiction within 5 days after notification of the time and place of the evaluation.

<center><h3>Section 169-B:22</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:22 Disposition of a Minor with a Disability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any point during the proceedings, the court may, either on its own motion or that of any other person, and if the court contemplates a residential placement, the court shall immediately, join the legally liable school district for the limited purposes of directing the school district to determine whether the minor is a child with a disability or of directing the school district to review the services offered or provided under RSA 186-C, if the minor has already been determined to be a child with a disability.  If the court orders the school district to determine whether the minor is a child with a disability, the school district shall make this determination by treating the order as the equivalent of a referral by the child's parent for special education, and shall conduct any team meetings or evaluations that are required under law when a school district receives a referral by a child's parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Once joined as a party, the legally liable school district shall have full access to all records maintained by the district court under this chapter.  The school district shall also report to the court its determination of whether the minor is a child with a disability, and the basis for such determination.  If the child is determined to be a child with a disability, the school district shall make a recommendation to the court as to where the child's educational needs can be met in accordance with state and federal education laws.  In cases where the court does not follow the school district's recommendation, the court shall issue written findings explaining why the recommendation was not followed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the school district finds or has found that the minor has a disability, or if it is found that the minor is a child with a disability on appeal from the school district's decision in accordance with the due process procedures of RSA 186-C, the school district shall offer an appropriate educational program and placement in accordance with RSA 186-C.  Financial liability for such education program shall be as determined in RSA 186-C:19-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In an administrative due process hearing conducted by the department of education pursuant to RSA 186-C, a school district may provide a hearing officer with information from district court records which the school district has accessed pursuant to paragraph II of this section, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At least 20 days prior to providing any records to the hearing officer, the school district files notice of its intention to do so with the court and all parties to the proceedings, and no party objects to the release of records;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The notice filed by a school district under this section shall include, on a separate sheet of paper, the following statement in bold typeface: "Persons subject to juvenile proceedings have important rights to the confidentiality of juvenile court proceedings.  This notice requests the disclosure of some or all of that information.  If you object to the disclosure of information, you must file a written objection with the court no later than 10 days after the filing of the school district's notice.  If you fail to object in writing, the court may allow private information to be revealed to the New Hampshire Department of Education hearing officer.'';  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any objection by a party shall be filed with the court no later than 10 days after the filing of the school district's notice with the court, unless such time is extended by the court for good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court may, on its own initiative and no later than 13 days after the filing of the school district's notice to the court, issue an order directing the school district to show cause as to why the information should be disclosed to the hearing officer.  Upon receipt of an objection or issuance of a show cause order, the court shall schedule an expedited hearing on the matter to determine if the requested records may be released.  The court may rule without a hearing if the school district and a parent or legal guardian or the juvenile, if he or she has reached the age of majority, agree in writing to waive a hearing.  Upon the filing of an objection or show cause order, the school district may file a reply explaining why the school district believes that the information should be disclosed to the hearing officer.  In determining whether to authorize the disclosure of the information requested by the school district, the court shall balance the importance of disclosure of the records to a fair and accurate determination of the merits against the privacy interests of the parties to the proceedings, and render a written decision setting forth its findings and rulings.  No information released to a hearing officer pursuant to this paragraph shall be disclosed to any other person or entity without the written permission of the court, the child's parent or legal guardian, or the juvenile if he or she has reached the age of majority, except that a court conducting an appellate review of an administrative due process hearing shall have access to the same information released to a hearing officer pursuant to this paragraph.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:24 Transfer to Superior Court. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All cases before the court in which the offense complained of constitutes a felony or would amount to a felony in the case of an adult may be transferred to the superior court prior to hearing under RSA 169-B:16 as provided in this section.  The court shall conduct a hearing on the question of transfer and shall consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria in determining whether a case should be transferred:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the protection of the community requires transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful nature of the alleged offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the alleged offense was committed against persons or property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The prospective merit of the complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one court if the minor's associates in the alleged offense were adults who will be charged with a crime.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The sophistication and maturity of the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The minor's prior record and prior contacts with law enforcement agencies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The prospects of adequate protection of the public, and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the minor through the juvenile court system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The minor shall be entitled to the assistance of counsel.  Both the prosecutor and counsel for the minor shall have access to the court records, probation reports, or other agency reports.  If the court orders transfer to superior court, it shall provide a written statement of findings and reasons for such transfer to the minor.  When persons so certified are accepted by the superior court, the superior court may dispose of all criminal charges arising out of the incident which led to the transfer petition according to the relevant laws of this state without any limitations as to sentence or orders required by this chapter.  All original papers in transferred cases shall remain in the court from which transferred and certified copies of the papers shall be filed with and shall constitute the records of the court to which transfer is made.  Pending disposition by the superior court, a juvenile who is transferred and accepted by the superior court may be placed under the supervision of the department of corrections or required to recognize with sufficient sureties, or in default of such sureties, be detained at a county correctional facility to await disposition of the case in the superior court;  provided, however, once a minor is certified for trial as an adult and the person is transferred to the superior court, detention at the youth development center is prohibited.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the filing of a petition for transfer to the superior court, the court shall conduct a scheduling hearing and establish a scheduling order for all future hearings necessary to the transfer petition, notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 169-B:14, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the felony offense charged is first degree murder, second degree murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, first degree assault, second degree assault (except when the allegation is a violation of RSA 631:2, I(d)), aggravated felonious sexual assault, kidnapping, criminal restraint, robbery punishable as a class A felony, a violation of RSA 318-B:26, I(a) or (b), or negligent homicide under RSA 630:3, II, or when the minor is charged with any felony and, prior to the filing of the felony petition, the minor has been petitioned to the court on 4 or more occasions and adjudicated delinquent in 4 separate adjudicatory hearings which alleged misdemeanor or felony offenses, and the minor commits the act after the minor's fifteenth birthday, there shall be a presumption that the factors listed in RSA 169-B:24, I support transfer to the superior court.

The petition shall set forth the nature of the offense with which the person is charged and shall specify the person's whereabouts if known.  On receipt of such petition, the court may summarily authorize the county attorney or attorney general to proceed against such person under regular criminal procedures, and without regard to the provisions of this chapter.  Pending determination by the superior court as provided in this section and pending final disposition of the matter, such persons shall be bailable with sufficient sureties as in the case of adults and, in default thereof, may be committed to the custody of the juvenile probation and parole officer or detained at a county correctional facility unless detention elsewhere is ordered by the superior court.  The superior court shall determine, after hearing, whether such person shall be treated as a juvenile under the provisions of this section or whether the case shall be disposed of according to regular criminal procedures.

(a) Termination of parental rights or parental surrender when an adoption is contemplated;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Guardianship with a fit and willing relative or another appropriate party;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Another planned permanent living arrangement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The department shall request reimbursement for such expenses from parents or other people chargeable by law for the minor's support and shall request assignment to the state of any insurance benefits that may be available to pay for all or a portion of the services provided.  The court shall require the individual chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities to submit a financial statement annually to the court upon which the court shall make an order as to reimbursement to the state as may be reasonable and just, based on the person's ability to pay.  Such financial statement shall include, but not be limited to, any benefits received from the Social Security Administration or insurance benefits available to the individual.  The court shall include disposition of these benefits in its order as to reimbursement.

IV. The department may enter into an agreement with a county to collect, on behalf of the department, payments from persons or entities which are ordered to reimburse the state under paragraph I, or which are chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities.  An agreement may authorize the county to deduct reasonable administrative costs from the amounts collected.  The balance of any amounts collected by the county pursuant to this paragraph shall be forwarded to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
 V. If the person responsible for paying reimbursements to the department under paragraph IV is financially able to pay such reimbursements but fails to make such payments, the department may apply to the district court for a lien on such person's real or personal property for the amount of reimbursements due.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:43 Court Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The court, upon a complaint issued under RSA 169-B:42, may proceed under that section and, in addition, if the court finds, after a hearing, that the parent, guardian, or person having custody or control of the minor has failed to exercise reasonable diligence in the control of such minor to prevent the minor from becoming guilty of juvenile delinquency as defined by statute, or from becoming adjudged by the court to be in need of the care and protection of the state as defined by statute, it may make such order specifying future conduct as is designed to reasonably prevent the reoccurrence of delinquency and to promote the future welfare of the minor.  Such order shall remain in effect for a period of not more than one year to be specified by the court, and said order may be extended or renewed by the court.  Before issuing any such order, the court shall advise such parent, guardian, or other person of the right to have the reasonableness of the order immediately reviewed;  and, in this connection, the superior court is vested with jurisdiction to summarily determine the reasonableness of any question of law or fact relating to such written specifications and to make such further orders upon review thereof as justice may require.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
