<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Determined to have a mental illness, emotional or behavioral disorder, or another disorder that may impede the child's decision-making abilities;  or
<br>

(C) Identified as eligible for special education services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Such inquiry shall be conducted to gather complete and accurate information.  The court shall make a record of the inquiry and of any information provided in response to the inquiry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. No plea shall be taken until the minor has the opportunity to consult with counsel or until a waiver is filed pursuant to RSA 169-B:12.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may, at any time after arraignment, dispose of the petition by referring the minor or the minor and family for participation in a court approved diversion program or other intervention program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A referral under this section may include an order for the minor to perform up to 50 hours of uncompensated public service subject to the approval of the elected or appointed official authorized to give approval of the city or town in which the offense occurred.  The court's order for uncompensated public service shall include the name of the official who will provide supervision to the minor.  However, no person who performs such public service under this paragraph shall receive any benefits that such employer gives to its other employees, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation and unemployment benefits and no such employer shall be liable for any damages sustained by a person while performing such public service or any damages caused by that person unless the employer is guilty of gross negligence.
