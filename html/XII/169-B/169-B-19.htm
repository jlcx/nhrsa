Restitution ordered by the court may be collected by the department or by the court or by an agency designated by the court to collect it.  In any case where a parent is ordered to pay all or any portion of the fine or restitution pursuant to RSA 169-B:2-a, the parents shall have the right to a hearing before the court to contest the amount of restitution or their liability.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Order the minor or the family or both to undergo physical treatment or treatment by a mental health center or any other psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric social worker or family therapist as determined by the court, or to attend mediation sessions, parenting programs, or any other such program or programs the court determines to carry out the purposes of this chapter, with expenses charged according to RSA 169-B:40.  Utilization of community resource programs shall be encouraged.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) Place the minor on conditional release for a term no longer than 5 years.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) Release the minor in the care and supervision of a relative or friend;  or to home detention for a period not to exceed 6 months.  Such home detention shall be subject to the written consent of the parents to the terms and conditions established by the court.  The court shall include in its order for home detention any restrictions on the hours of detention.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(f) Release the minor to the custody of the department of health and human services for placement in a foster home, as defined in RSA 169-C:3, XIII, a group home, a crisis home, or a shelter care facility, with expenses charged according to RSA 169-B:40.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(g) [Repealed.]<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(h) Order the minor to perform up to 50 hours of uncompensated public service subject to the approval of the elected or appointed official authorized to give approval of the city or town in which the offense occurred.  The court's order for uncompensated public service shall include the name of the official who will provide supervision to the minor.  However, no person who performs such public service under this paragraph shall receive any benefits that such employer gives to its other employees, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation and unemployment benefits and no such employer shall be liable for any damages sustained by a person while performing such public service or any damages caused by that person unless the employer is guilty of gross negligence.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(i) Any combination of the above.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(j) Commit the minor to the custody of the department of health and human services for the remainder of minority.  Commitment under this subparagraph may only be made following written findings of fact by the court, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that commitment is necessary to protect the safety of the minor or of the community, and may only be made if the minor has not waived the right to counsel at any stage of the proceedings.  Commitment may not be based on a finding of contempt of court if the minor has waived counsel in the contempt proceeding or at any stage of the proceedings from which the contempt arises.

A minor found to be a delinquent on a petition filed after the minor's sixteenth birthday, in addition to or in place of the dispositions provided for in paragraph I, may be committed to a county correctional facility for no greater term than an adult could be committed for a like offense;  provided, however, that during minority the minor shall not be confined in a county correctional facility and provided further that the term shall not extend beyond the minor's eighteenth birthday.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII-a.

To obtain a de novo jury trial under this chapter, the juvenile shall file a written request in the clerk's office within 3 days of the dispositional order.  A copy of the written request shall also be provided to the local prosecutor and the county attorney.  The request shall be given priority on the court's calendar.  Whenever possible, any such hearing shall be held in a district court building equipped with jury capability.  It shall be conducted by a district court judge specially assigned by the administrative judge of the district court.  The jury panel shall be chosen from the jury pool of the superior court serving the county in which the court is located.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) The court in which the petition originated shall retain jurisdiction over all matters and orders pertaining to the placement, supervision and treatment of the juvenile during the pendency of the pre-trial and trial proceedings.  The request for jury trial shall not suspend any provisions of the original court's order regarding placement, supervision, evaluation, or treatment.  All other orders shall be vacated pending the de novo jury trial.  The judge assigned to conduct the jury trial shall have authority to preside over the jury trial, decide trial management issues, and rule on all pre-trial and post-trial adjudicatory findings.  In the event the juvenile waives the right to jury trial after the case has been specially assigned, the case shall be returned to the court in which the petition originated for continued action pursuant to this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) In the event the jury returns a finding of not true on all charges, the dispositional order in its entirety shall be vacated.  In the event the jury returns a finding of true on one or more of the charges, the trial judge shall review and may reinstate or modify only those portions of the dispositional order made by the originating court suspended under this section during the pendency of the de novo process.  In all other respects, the original dispositional order shall remain in effect.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) The provisions of RSA 169-B:34 through 169-B:38, relating to confidentiality of proceedings and records, shall apply to all de novo trials conducted pursuant to this section.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. A summary of the investigative officer's report shall accompany each commitment order.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. All dispositional orders issued pursuant to this section shall include written findings as to the basis for the disposition, and such conditions as the court may determine.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. A minor committed to the youth development center for the remainder of minority may be placed at any facility certified by the commissioner of the department of health and human services for the commitment of minors.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall be responsible for notifying the court, within 5 business days, of any such placement and of any subsequent changes in placement made within 60 days of the original placement.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. If the judge orders services, placements or programs different from the recommendations of the department, the judge shall include a statement of the costs of services, placements and programs so ordered.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. When a dispositional order places a minor in an out-of-home placement pursuant to RSA 169-B:19, I(e) or (f), prior to concluding the dispositional hearing the court shall set a date for a permanency hearing pursuant to RSA 169-B:31-a, I.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIX. Prior to any placement which will require educational services outside the minor's home school district, the court shall notify the school district and give the district the opportunity to send a representative to the hearing at which such placement is contemplated.  At such hearing the court shall consider the recommendations of the school district and if such an out-of-district placement is ordered the court shall make written findings that describe the reasons for the placement.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX. The court may issue such orders as are necessary to ensure provision of services under this chapter, provided that any order issued involving the department of education or a legally liable school district shall comply with RSA 169-B:22.">
