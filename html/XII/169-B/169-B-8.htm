I. Any person summoned who, without reasonable cause, fails to appear with the minor, may be proceeded against as in case of contempt of court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a summons cannot be served or the party served fails to obey the same, and in any case where it appears to the court that such summons will be ineffectual, a warrant may be issued for the minor's appearance or for the appearance of anyone having custody or control of the minor or for both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and II, a warrant may be issued for the detention of a minor whose offense constitutes a felony against the person or property, or a felony under RSA 318-B.
