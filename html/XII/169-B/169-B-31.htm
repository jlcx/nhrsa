&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:31 Case Closure and Review of Disposition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon making a finding that the purposes of this chapter have been met with regard to the minor named in the petition, or for such other reason the court may deem appropriate and consistent with the purposes of this chapter, the court may order a case closed.  Any case remaining open for 12 months after the date of the disposition shall be reviewed by the court annually and closed, unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the continued provision of services and court involvement are necessary and shall be fruitful to rehabilitate the minor or protect the public interest.  All such findings shall be in writing and shall include the basis upon which those findings were made.
