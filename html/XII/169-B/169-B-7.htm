I. After a legally sufficient petition has been filed, the court shall issue a summons to be served personally or, if personal service is not possible, at the usual place of abode of the person having custody or control of the minor or with whom the minor may be, requiring that person to appear with the minor at a specified place and time, which time shall not be less than 24 hours nor more than 7 days after service.  If the person so notified is not the parent or guardian of the minor, then a parent or guardian shall be notified, provided they and their residence are known, or if there is neither parent nor guardian, or their residence is not known, then some relative, if there be one whose residence is known.
<br>

II. A copy of the petition shall be attached to each summons or incorporated therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
