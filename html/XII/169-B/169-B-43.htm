&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-B:43 Court Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The court, upon a complaint issued under RSA 169-B:42, may proceed under that section and, in addition, if the court finds, after a hearing, that the parent, guardian, or person having custody or control of the minor has failed to exercise reasonable diligence in the control of such minor to prevent the minor from becoming guilty of juvenile delinquency as defined by statute, or from becoming adjudged by the court to be in need of the care and protection of the state as defined by statute, it may make such order specifying future conduct as is designed to reasonably prevent the reoccurrence of delinquency and to promote the future welfare of the minor.  Such order shall remain in effect for a period of not more than one year to be specified by the court, and said order may be extended or renewed by the court.  Before issuing any such order, the court shall advise such parent, guardian, or other person of the right to have the reasonableness of the order immediately reviewed;  and, in this connection, the superior court is vested with jurisdiction to summarily determine the reasonableness of any question of law or fact relating to such written specifications and to make such further orders upon review thereof as justice may require.
