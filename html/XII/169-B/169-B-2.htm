In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Adult lock-up or jail'' means a locked facility, used primarily to house adults charged with or convicted of violating criminal law.  This includes police lock-ups, county correctional facilities, and any facility used by county sheriffs, state police, or local police to securely detain adult offenders and accused offenders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Alternative to secure detention'' means any local program, approved by the court, police, probation, or the department of health and human services, which offers a less restrictive alternative to secure detention for minors.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, youth attender, crisis home placement, group homes which have entered into agreements with the department of health and human services to provide such care, truant and runaway programs, and alcohol and drug detoxification programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Court'' means the district court, unless otherwise indicated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. "Custody'' means a legal status created by court order wherein the department of health and human services has placement and care responsibility for the minor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Delinquent'' means a person who has committed an offense before reaching the age of 17 years which would be a felony or misdemeanor under the criminal code of this state if committed by an adult, and is expressly found to be in need of counselling, supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation as a consequence thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. "Diversion'' means a decision made by a person with authority which results in specific official action of the legal system not being taken or being postponed in regard to a juvenile and, in lieu of such inaction or postponement, providing an individually designed program for delivery of services for the juvenile by a specific provider or a plan to assist the juvenile in finding a remedy for his or her inappropriate behavior.  The goal of diversion is to prevent further involvement of the juvenile in the formal legal system.  Diversion of a juvenile may take place either at prefiling as an alternative to the filing of a petition, or at arraignment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-b. "Court approved diversion program'' means a program that has been approved by the administrative judge of the judicial branch family division and has been approved to accept court referrals.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-c. "Intervention'' means a decision made by a person with authority which results in specific official action of the legal system not being taken or being postponed in regard to a juvenile and, in lieu of such inaction or postponement, providing an individually designed program for delivery of services for the juvenile by a specific provider or a plan to assist the juvenile in finding a remedy for his or her inappropriate behavior.  The goal of intervention is to prevent further involvement of the juvenile in the formal legal system.  Intervention for a juvenile may take place either at the adjudicatory or dispositional level.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The conditions and limitations of the minor's conduct prescribed by the court;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Such substitute care may include placement with a custodian, guardian, relative, friend, group home, crisis home, shelter care, or a foster home.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Permanency hearing'' means a court hearing for a minor in an out-of-home placement to review, modify, and/or implement the permanency plan or adopt the concurrent plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. "Permanency plan'' means a plan for a minor in an out-of-home placement that is adopted by the court and that provides for timely reunification, termination of parental rights or parental surrender when an adoption is contemplated, guardianship with a fit and willing relative or another appropriate party, or another planned permanent living arrangement.
