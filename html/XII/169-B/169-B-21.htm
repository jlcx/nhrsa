&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any court, finding that a minor has committed the alleged offense may, before making a final disposition, order the minor, minor's parents, guardian, or person with custody or control to submit to a mental health or substance abuse evaluation to be completed within 60 days.  Any substance abuse evaluation of the parent guardian, or person having custody of the child shall be conducted by a provider contracted with the bureau of substance abuse services, or a provider paid by the parent, guardian, or person having custody of the child.  The cost of such evaluation shall be paid by private insurance, if available, or otherwise by the person undergoing the evaluation, to whom the evaluation shall be provided free or at reduced cost if the person is of limited means.  A written report of the evaluation shall be given to the court before the dispositional hearing.  If the parents, guardian, minor, or person having custody or control objects to the mental health or substance abuse evaluation, they shall object in writing to the court having jurisdiction within 5 days after notification of the time and place of the evaluation.  The court shall hold a hearing to consider the objection prior to ordering such evaluation.  Upon good cause shown, the court may excuse the parents, guardian, minor, or person having custody or control from the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever such an evaluation has been made for consideration at a previous hearing, it shall be jointly reviewed by the court and the evaluating agency before the case is heard.  The evaluating facility, agency, or individual shall keep records, but no reports or records of information contained therein shall be made available other than to the court and parties, except upon the written consent of the person examined or treated and except as provided in RSA 169-B:35.  The expense of such evaluation shall be borne as provided in RSA 169-B:40.
