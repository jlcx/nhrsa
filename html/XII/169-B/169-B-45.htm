&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For purposes of this section, "vandalism'' has the same meaning as "criminal mischief'' in RSA 634:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court shall, when appropriate, order any child who is found to have committed vandalism of private property to write a formal apology to the victim or victims of such vandalism.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The court shall, when appropriate, order any child who is found to have committed vandalism of public property to write a report on the history and significance of that property to the community or on another topic, as determined by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court shall also order, when appropriate, any child who is found to have committed vandalism to contribute to the restoration of the property or to the restitution to the victim or victims of such vandalism by payment in money, by property repairs, by service to the injured party, or by service to the community.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the court may order the parent or legal guardian of any child found to have committed vandalism, to submit restitution to the victim or victims of such vandalism by payment in money if the child is in the custody of and residing with such parent or guardian, and if the court finds that the vandalism was a direct result of the parent or legal guardian having neglected to exercise reasonable supervision and control of the child's conduct.  For the purposes of this section, liability for compensation shall be limited to $10,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the person violates the court's order to submit restitution under this section, such person shall be guilty of contempt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The court may permit payments under this section to be made in installments, up to 7 years, to be administered by the court.
