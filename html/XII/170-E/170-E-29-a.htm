Child care institutions and child care agencies, with the exception of foster family homes, that are required to be licensed according to the provisions of this chapter shall, prior to making a final offer of employment to a person who will be responsible for the care of, or who will have regular contact with children, and upon adding a new household member, a current household member who turns 17 years of age, or other persons who will have regular contact with children, submit to the department, the names, birth names, birth dates, and addresses of such persons and other information required by the department as prescribed by rules adopted by the commissioner under RSA 541-A.  The persons described in this paragraph shall submit directly to the department of safety a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any, to the department.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the department of safety.  The department of safety shall complete the criminal history records check and forward such record, if any, to the department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints shall be necessary to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. (a) The department shall, for every name submitted on an application and for each person for whom information is required to be submitted pursuant to paragraph I, review the names, birth names, birth dates, and current and previous addresses of such persons against the state registry of founded abuse and neglect reports.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) The department of safety shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police, which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.

If any person whose name has been submitted for this check has been convicted of a felony offense or violent crime deemed directly or indirectly harmful to children in child residential care, crimes against minors or adults, except crimes as provided in paragraph V, or is the subject of a founded complaint of child abuse or neglect, the department may deny, revoke, or suspend a license, permit, or registration pending the development and implementation of a corrective action plan approved by the department.  The department shall conduct an investigation in accordance with rules adopted under this subdivision to determine whether the person poses a present threat to the safety of children.  The investigation shall include an opportunity for the person to present evidence on his or her behalf to show that the person does not pose a threat to the safety of children.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. At the time the licensee is next due to renew the license, the licensee shall submit a notarized criminal conviction record release authorization form and a set of fingerprints to the department of safety for any existing employee or household member who is 17 years of age or older and who has not undergone a national criminal background check as of the effective date of this section.  Upon receiving the results of the state and national criminal records check, if the licensee learns that a current employee has been convicted of any felony, a sexual assault, any other violent crime, assault including simple assault, abuse, neglect or any other crime that shows that they may pose a threat to well-being of children, such as a violent crime or a sexually-related crime against an adult, or has a founded allegation of abuse, neglect or exploitation against children, the licensee shall either terminate the employee or suspend the employee and promptly request a waiver from the department allowing the employee to resume working in the program.  Upon receiving the results of the state and national criminal records check, if the licensee learns that a current household member has been convicted of any felony, a sexual assault, any other violent crime, assault including simple assault, abuse, neglect or any other crime that shows that the person may pose a threat to well-being of children, such as a violent crime or a sexually-related crime against an adult, or has a founded allegation of abuse, neglect or exploitation against children, the licensee shall take immediate corrective action to remove the person from the child care institution or child care agency, and, in conjunction with the department, develop a corrective action plan, approved by the department, which shall ensure that the person will not be on the premises of the child care institution or child care agency and shall have no contact with children residing in the child care institution or agency.  If the licensee fails to take such corrective action, the department shall suspend the license until such time as the licensee does implement the corrective action, or it shall revoke the license.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII.
