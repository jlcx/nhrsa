<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any child care facility or child-placing agency receiving a child for care or supervision from a foreign state or country shall report that child to the department of health and human services in the same manner as it is required for reporting other children pursuant to RSA 170-A:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A person other than a licensed child care institution or child-placing agency shall not receive a child from a foreign state or country without prior notice to and approval of the department of health and human services.  Any placement of children shall conform to RSA 170-A and RSA 170-B:28.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department of health and human services may require a guarantee that a child accepted for care or supervision from a foreign state or country will not become a public charge upon this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department of health and human services may enter into agreements with public or voluntary social agencies headquartered in states adjacent to this state regarding the placement of children in licensed foster family homes within the boundaries of this state if the agencies meet the standards and criteria required for license as a child-placing agency in this state.  The agreements may allow foreign agencies to place and supervise children for whom they have responsibility with this state without regard to paragraph I.  These agreements shall, however, include a requirement that the agencies cooperate fully with the department in its inquiry or investigation into the activities and standards of those agencies, and provide that the department of health and human services may, at any time upon 15 days' written notice to an agency by registered mail, void the agreement and require the observance of paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department of health and human services shall perform its duties under this section with the approval of the commissioner.
