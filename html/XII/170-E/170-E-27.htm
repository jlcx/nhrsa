&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 170-E:27 License Required;  Prohibition Against Child Endangerment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person may establish, maintain, operate or conduct any agency for child care or for child-placing without a license or permit issued by the department under this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No person, whether licensed as a child care agency or institution or child-placing agency, or exempted from licensing pursuant to RSA 170-E:26, I, shall care for a child in a manner which endangers the health, safety or welfare of the child.  For purposes of this paragraph, endangerment shall mean the negligent violation of a duty of care or protection owed to such child or negligently inducing such child to engage in conduct which endangers his health or safety.  Licensees in violation of this paragraph shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 170-E:35.  Persons exempted from licensing who are in violation of this paragraph shall be enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of RSA 170-E:46 from caring for such child and may be enjoined, as the court may determine, from caring for other children.  The court in its order for injunctive relief shall provide for removal and placement of the child who is the subject of the order with an organization licensed pursuant to this subdivision.
