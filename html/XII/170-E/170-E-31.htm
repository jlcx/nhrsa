<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Licenses shall be issued in such form and manner as prescribed by rules adopted by the commissioner under RSA 541-A and, for foster family homes and specialized care, shall be valid for 2 years from the date issued, unless revoked by the department, or voluntarily surrendered by the licensee, or subject to conditions attached to the license which provide for a shorter license period than 2 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department may provide dual licensure to a facility or child-placing agency.  Such licensure shall be granted only upon application and shall be contingent upon a determination, by the appropriate licensing units consulting with each other, that the standards of both programs have been met without compromising any licensing requirements.  If the licensing units are unable to agree, the final decision shall be made by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Licensure for child care institutions and child-placing agencies shall be valid as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Group homes and child care institutions:  3 years from the effective date of the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Child-placing agencies:  4 years from the effective date of the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall make monitoring visits a minimum of once yearly each licensing period.  At least one such visit during the licensing period shall not be announced in advance;  however, such unannounced visit is optional for foster family homes.  Clear and comprehensive records shall be maintained by the department on each licensed facility showing the dates and findings of each such visit.  Such records shall be made available to the facility.  If the facility is found not to be in compliance either with the statute or the rules adopted by the commissioner, a corrective action plan shall be submitted to the department.  Failure to submit an acceptable plan shall result in license suspension or revocation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department may issue a 6-month permit to a newly established facility for child care, or to an established facility which has changed its physical location, to allow that facility reasonable time to become eligible for full licensure.  The 6-month permit may be issued immediately upon completion of the necessary licensing inspections.  If the language on such permit allows it, the facility may begin operation immediately without waiting for the state office to complete the processing of the application.
