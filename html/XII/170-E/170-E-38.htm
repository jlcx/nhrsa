<codesect>
Whenever the department is advised, or has reason to believe, that any entity is operating a child care facility or child-placing agency without a license or permit, it may make an investigation to ascertain the facts.  If it finds that the child care facility or child-placing agency is operating or has operated without a license or permit, the department may report the results of its investigation to the attorney general or to the appropriate county attorney for prosecution.
