<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Child day care providers who are required to be licensed or registered according to the provisions of this chapter shall, no later than an individual's first day of employment, which individual is responsible for the care of, or having regular contact with children, and upon adding new household members or other individuals who will have regular contact with children, submit to the department, the names, birth names, birth dates, and addresses of such individuals and other information required by the department as prescribed by rules adopted by the commissioner under RSA 541-A.  The persons described in this paragraph shall submit directly to the department of safety a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any, to the department.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the department of safety.  The department of safety shall complete the criminal history records check and forward such record, if any, to the department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints shall be necessary to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The department shall, for every name submitted on an application, in the registration process, and for each individual for whom information is required to be submitted pursuant to paragraph I, review the names, birth names, birth dates, and current and previous addresses of such persons against the state registry of founded abuse and neglect reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The department of safety shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police, which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.  The department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The costs of criminal history record checks shall be borne by the child day care provider;  provided, that the child day care provider may require an applicant to pay the actual costs of the criminal history check of the employee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. If an individual who is or has been employed or volunteered at a child day care agency is offered employment or volunteers at another child day care agency, the individual shall not be required to submit a new set of fingerprints and undergo a new criminal records check through the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as required in subparagraph II(b), provided that the individual has submitted fingerprints and undergone such a criminal records check under this section within 3 years of the individual's first day of employment or volunteer service at the new agency.  Before entering employment or volunteering with the new agency, the individual shall undergo a New Hampshire state criminal records check through the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If any individual whose name has been submitted for a check under this section has been convicted of a violent or sexually-related crime against a child, or of a crime which shows that the person might be reasonably expected to pose a threat to a child, such as a violent crime or a sexually-related crime against an adult, the department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the individual is the applicant or owner, revoke or deny the license or permit, or withhold state funds if the child day care provider is not required to be licensed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the individual is a board member, household member, or child day care personnel, or any other individual having regular contact with the enrolled children, inform the child day care agency or registered provider that the individual poses a threat to children and give the agency or registered provider an opportunity to take immediate corrective action to remove the individual from the agency, and, in conjunction with the department, to develop a corrective action plan, approved by the department, which shall ensure that the individual will not be on the premises of the child day care program and shall have no contact with children enrolled in the child day care program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Suspend, deny, or revoke the license or permit if the child day care program refuses to take corrective action as indicated in subparagraph (b), or subsequently fails to comply with the corrective action plan approved by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon a finding of criminal activity as described in this paragraph, withhold state funding to registered child day care providers that are exempt from the licensing requirements of RSA 170-E:4 if the provider refuses to take corrective action as indicated in subparagraph (b), or fails to comply with the corrective action plan approved by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If any individual whose name has been submitted for this check has been convicted of a felony offense deemed directly or indirectly harmful to children in child day care, crimes against minors or adults, except crimes as provided in paragraph III, or is the subject of a founded complaint of child abuse or neglect, the department may deny, revoke, or suspend a license, permit, or registration pending the development and implementation of a corrective action plan approved by the department.  In addition, the department may, upon a finding of criminal activity or a founded complaint of child abuse or neglect as described in this paragraph, withhold state funding to registered child day care providers that are exempt from the licensing requirements of RSA 170-E:4 pending the development and implementation of a corrective action plan approved by the department.  The department shall conduct an investigation in accordance with rules adopted under this subdivision to determine whether the individual poses a present threat to the safety of children.  The investigation shall include an opportunity for the individual to present evidence on his behalf to show that the individual does not pose a threat to the safety of children.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the confidentiality of information collected under this section and to the release, if any, of such information.
