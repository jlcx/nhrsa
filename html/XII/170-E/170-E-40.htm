&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 170-E:40 Investigation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the department has reason to believe that state or federal funds solicited and received by a corporation for conduct of a child care facility or child-placing agency are not being used for the purpose for which the funds were awarded, or are being fraudulently used by the corporation or its members, or purportedly are being used for a facility or child-placing agency which is actually defunct, or are being used for a facility or child-placing agency which no longer carries a valid license or permit, the department shall report these facts to the attorney general and request an investigation of the corporation to determine if the corporation should be dissolved or whether other action should be taken against the corporation or its members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall conduct an investigation of any complaint of violations of any licensing or operating standards against permitted or licensed child care or child-placing agencies.  All investigations shall be conducted at reasonable times, with the cooperation of other state or municipal authorities, if required, and may include unannounced visits.  The commissioner shall request an annual narrative summary of complaints received by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Records compiled during an investigation shall be confidential and shall not be made public by the department.
