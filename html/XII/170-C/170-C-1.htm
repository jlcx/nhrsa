&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 170-C:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the involuntary termination of the parent-child relationship by a judicial process which will safeguard the rights and interests of all parties concerned and when it is in the best interest of the child.  Implicit in this chapter is the philosophy that whenever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved, and that the parent-child relationship is to be terminated only when the adoption of that child may be contemplated.
