&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 170-C:11 Decree. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every order of the court terminating the parent-child relationship or transferring legal custody or guardianship of the person of the child shall be in writing and shall recite the findings upon which such order is based, including findings pertaining to the court's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the court finds grounds for the termination of the parent-child relationship, it shall terminate such relationship and appoint the department of health and human services or another authorized agency as guardian of the child's person and vest legal custody in such agency.  The court shall also make an order fixing responsibility for the child's support.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 170-C:11, II, the court may terminate the parent-child relationship with respect to one parent without affecting the relationship between the child and the other parent, and unless the court finds that the best interest of the child requires substitution or supplementation of parental care and supervision, it shall award guardianship and vest legal custody in the other parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Where the court does not order termination of the parent-child relationship, it shall dismiss the petition;  provided, however, that where the court finds that the best interest of the child requires substitution or supplementation of parental care and supervision, it shall make an order awarding guardianship with the department of health and human services or an authorized agency and fixing responsibility for temporary child support.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court shall issue a decision which shall include a disposition not later than 60 days after the date of the final hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The status of all children for whom termination decrees have been issued and for whom guardianship for the purpose of adoption has been granted to the department of health and human services shall be reviewed at least once a year following the initial decree until the adoption decree has been finalized.
