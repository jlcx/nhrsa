&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 170-C:13 Fees and Court Costs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The petitioner shall pay all entry fees and court costs including costs of giving notice, costs of advertising, and court-appointed guardian ad litem fees.  The court, however, may waive entry fees and court costs where payment would work a hardship on the petitioner.  Where the court waives payment by the petitioner, the state, through the court system, shall pay court costs.  The judicial council shall pay the cost of a CASA guardian ad litem appointed for the child or other guardian ad litem in cases arising from an underlying abuse and neglect proceeding when the state is the moving party or in cases where payment would work a hardship on the petitioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of health and human services is exempted from paying any entry fees and court costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When appointment of counsel is made by the court pursuant to RSA 170-C:10 for a parent determined to be financially unable to employ counsel, the court shall use a financial eligibility guideline established by the office of cost containment to determine if the party is indigent.  Upon determination that the party is indigent, the court may appoint counsel, subject to an order of repayment through the office of cost containment.  The judicial council shall bear no financial responsibility for the payment of appointed attorney costs in such cases where the state is not the moving party for the termination of parental rights.  The court shall pay for the appointment of counsel for an indigent parent made in accordance with the financial eligibility guideline established by the office of cost containment.
