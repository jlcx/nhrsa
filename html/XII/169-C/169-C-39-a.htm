<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislature recognizes that child abuse and neglect are serious societal problems, are threats to the family unit, and result in major expenses to society.  The legislature further declares that there is a need to assist private and public agencies in initiating and enhancing community based educational and service programs for the prevention of these misfortunes.  It is the intent of the legislature to support programs that will reduce conditions leading to child abuse and thus limit the need for future state intervention and expense.  It is further intended that programs for preventing child abuse and neglect will be cooperative ventures of citizens, communities, and the state.  The purpose of this subdivision is to create a new fund to be used exclusively for the prevention of child abuse and neglect, in order to augment funds currently available from federal, state, or local sources for this purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of this subdivision is to provide a new source of funding, to be known as the New Hampshire children's trust fund, which shall increase the funds available for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.  The legislature does not intend that these funds will be used as a substitute for any funds available from federal, state, or local sources for prevention programs;  nor does the legislature intend that these funds will substitute for state appropriations to the budget of the department of health and human services or to any other state agency.
