<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A consent order shall not be approved unless the department consents and the child and parents, guardian, or custodian are informed of the consequences of the order by the court and the court determines that the child and parents voluntarily and intelligently consent to the terms and conditions of the order.  A consent order under this section may include a finding of abuse or neglect;  however, a finding of abuse or neglect shall not be required except where the consent order provides for out-of-home placement of the child.
