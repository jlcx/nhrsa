<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the department of health and human services recommends or initiates an out-of-home placement or a change in placement that will result in a change of school assignment, whether within or out of the district, the department shall notify the school district as soon as possible to allow the school district to participate in the facilitation of a successful transition of the child from one school to the next.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department and school district shall develop a transition plan for the child.  The objective of the plan shall be to minimize the number of placements for the child and to facilitate any change in placement or school assignment with the least emotional and mental impact to the child.  To the extent appropriate, the child may be involved in the formation of the plan.
