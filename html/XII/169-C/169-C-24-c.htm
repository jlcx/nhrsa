I. For a child who is in an out-of-home placement following the permanency hearing, the court shall hold and complete a post-permanency hearing within 12 months of the permanency hearing and every 12 months thereafter as long as the child remains in an out-of-home placement.  The court may conduct periodic post-permanency hearings upon its motion or upon the request of any party at any time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At a post-permanency hearing the court shall determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan that is in effect.  Where reunification is the permanency plan that is in effect, the court shall consider whether the services to the family have been accessible, available, and appropriate.
