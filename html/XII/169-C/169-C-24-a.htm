<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state, through an authorized agency, or if required by a district court, shall file a petition for termination of parental rights or, if such a petition has been filed by another party, the state shall seek to be joined as a party to such petition, where any one or more of the following circumstances exist:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Where a child has been in an out-of-home placement pursuant to a finding of child neglect or abuse, under the responsibility of the state, for 12 of the most recent 22 months;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Where a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that a child has been abandoned as defined by RSA 170-C:5, I;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Where a court of competent jurisdiction has made any one or more of the following determinations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) That the parent has been convicted of murder, pursuant to RSA 630:1-a or RSA 630:1-b, of another child of the parent, a sibling or step- sibling of the child, the child's other parent, or other persons related by consanguinity or affinity, including a minor child who resided with the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) That the parent has been convicted of manslaughter, pursuant to RSA 630:2, of another child of the parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) That the parent has been convicted of attempt, pursuant to RSA 629:1, solicitation, pursuant to RSA 629:2, or conspiracy, pursuant to RSA 629:3, to commit any of the offenses specified in subparagraphs I(c)(1) or I(c)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) That the parent has been convicted of a felony assault under RSA 631:1, 631:2, 632-A:2, or 632-A:3 that resulted in injury to the child, a sibling or step-sibling of the child, the child's other parent, or other persons related by consanguinity or affinity, including a minor child who resided with the defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Concurrent with the filing or joinder in a petition for termination of parental rights as defined in paragraph I of this section, the state shall seek to identify, recruit, and approve a qualified family for adoption in accordance with the provisions of RSA 170-B, and in accordance with the principle that the health and safety of the child shall be the paramount concern.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state may not be required to file a petition for termination of parental rights, or seek to be joined as a party to such a petition, if one or more of the following conditions exist:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The child is being appropriately cared for by a relative;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A state agency has documented in the case file a compelling reason for determining that filing a petition for termination of parental rights would not be in the best interests of the child;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The state has not provided to the family of the child, consistent with RSA 170-C:5, III, such services and reasonable efforts as the state deems necessary for the safe return of the child to the child's home.  In determining whether the state has made reasonable efforts to prevent placement and reunify the family, the district court shall consider whether services to the family have been accessible, available, and appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The state shall submit a sworn statement prior to any district court hearing in which the court is to determine whether there have been reasonable efforts to prevent placement, reunify the family, or make and finalize a new permanent home for the child.  Such statement shall be submitted to the court and to the parties at least 5 days prior to the hearing, and shall describe such reasonable efforts made by the state or the rationale for not making such efforts.
