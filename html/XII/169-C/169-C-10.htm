<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In cases brought pursuant to this chapter involving a neglected or abused child, the court shall appoint a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) or other approved program guardian ad litem for the child.  If a CASA or other approved program guardian ad litem is unavailable for appointment, the court may then appoint an attorney or other guardian ad litem as the guardian ad litem for the child.  The court shall not appoint an attorney for any guardian ad litem appointed for the child.  The CASA or other approved program guardian ad litem shall have the same authority and access to information as any other guardian ad litem.  For purposes of this paragraph, "unavailable for appointment'' means that there is no CASA or other approved program guardian ad litem available for appointment by the court following a finding of reasonable cause at the preliminary hearing held under RSA 169-C:15 so that the child's interests may effectively be represented in preparation for and at an adjudicatory hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) In cases involving a neglected or abused child under this chapter, where the child's expressed interests conflict with the recommendation for dispositional orders of the guardian ad litem, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the interests of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When an attorney is appointed as counsel for a child, representation may include counsel and investigative, expert and other services, including process to compel the attendance of witnesses, as may be necessary to protect the rights of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The New Hampshire supreme court shall adopt rules regarding the duties and responsibilities of the CASA guardian ad litem or other guardian ad litem appointed for the child.
