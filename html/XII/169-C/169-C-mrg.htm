&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-C:2 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the purpose of this chapter, through the mandatory reporting of suspected instances of child abuse or neglect, to provide protection to children whose life, health or welfare is endangered and to establish a judicial framework to protect the rights of all parties involved in the adjudication of child abuse or neglect cases.  Each child coming within the provisions of this chapter shall receive, preferably in his own home, the care, emotional security, guidance and control that will promote the child's best interest;  and, if the child should be removed from the control of his parents, guardian or custodian, adequate care shall be secured for the child.  This chapter seeks to coordinate efforts by state and local authorities, in cooperation with private agencies and organizations, citizens' groups, and concerned individuals, to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Protect the safety of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Preserve the unity of the family whenever possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide assistance to parents to deal with and correct problems in order to avoid removal of children from the family.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Take such action as may be necessary to prevent abuse or neglect of children.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Provide protection, treatment and rehabilitation, as needed, to children placed in alternative care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that its purpose may be carried out, to wit:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To encourage the mental, emotional, and physical development of each child coming within the provisions of this chapter, by providing him with the protection, care, treatment, counselling, supervision, and rehabilitative resources which he needs and has a right to receive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To achieve the foregoing purposes and policies, whenever possible, by keeping a child in contact with his home community and in a family environment by preserving the unity of the family and separating the child from his parents only when the safety of the child is in danger or when it is clearly necessary for his welfare or the interests of the public safety and when it can be clearly shown that a change in custody and control will plainly better the child;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To provide effective judicial procedures through which the provisions of this chapter are executed and enforced and which recognize and enforce the constitutional and other rights of the parties and assures them a fair hearing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-C:4 Jurisdiction, Continued Jurisdiction, Modification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all proceedings alleging the abuse or neglect of a child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may, with the consent of the child, retain jurisdiction over any child, who, prior to his or her eighteenth birthday, was found to be neglected or abused and who is attending school until such child completes high school or until his or her twenty-first birthday, whichever occurs first;  and the court is authorized to and shall make such orders relative to the support and maintenance of said child during the period after the child's eighteenth birthday as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. A child who has consented to the continued jurisdiction of the court pursuant to paragraph II, may revoke his or her consent and request that the case be closed.  The revocation of consent and request to close a case shall be made in writing and filed with the court.  Upon receipt of the request, the court shall forward copies to all parties of record at their last known address.  If no party objects within 10 business days of the date the court forwarded copies of the request to the parties, the court shall accept the child's revocation of consent and shall close the case.  If a party objects, the court may, after consideration of the objection, either grant the request and close the case without hearing or schedule the matter for hearing.  If the matter is scheduled for hearing, the court shall accept the child's revocation of consent and close the case unless the court finds that immediate closure would create a risk of substantial harm to the child.  If the court finds that immediate closure would create a risk of substantial harm to the child, the court shall continue the matter for a period not to exceed 30 days and direct that the department work with the child to develop an independent living plan which shall include referrals to appropriate services.  If at the end of such period, the child still wishes to revoke his or her consent and to request that the case be closed, the court shall accept the revocation of consent and close the case.
<br>

III. When a custody award has been made pursuant to this chapter, said order shall not be modified or changed nor shall another order affecting the status of the child be issued by the superior court except on appeal under RSA 169-C:28.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-C:6 Protective Custody. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A police or juvenile probation and parole officer may take a child into protective custody without the consent of the parents or other person legally responsible for the child's care if the child is in such circumstances or surroundings as would present an imminent danger to the child's health or life unless immediate action is taken and there is not enough time to petition for a court order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a police or juvenile probation and parole officer removes a child under paragraph I above, the officer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Shall inform the court forthwith whereupon continued protective custody pending a hearing may be ordered by the court;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) May take the child to a child protection services worker of the department;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) May place the child in a foster home;  if a child is placed directly in a foster home, the department shall be notified of the incident and where the child is placed within 24 hours, unless there is a physician involved and treating the child and the child is or will be taken to and admitted to a hospital;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Shall, when the child is removed from an individual other than a parent or a person legally responsible for the child, make every reasonable effort to inform both parents or other persons legally responsible for the child's care where the child has been taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any police or juvenile probation and parole officer or other individual acting in good faith pursuant to this section, shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result of such removal or placement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court shall hold a hearing on the matter within 24 hours of taking the child into protective custody, Sundays and holidays excluded.  Notice shall be given to both parents and all parties designated by the petitioner or the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a child is found by a child protection services worker of the department to be in imminent danger in such circumstances or surroundings and where immediate removal appears necessary to protect the child from such imminent danger, the department's child protection services worker shall contact a judge or clerk immediately for an order to remove the child.  Prior to any order authorizing foster placement, the child protective service worker shall inform the judge of efforts to locate any non-custodial parent or other relatives for temporary placement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The court having jurisdiction over a child who appears to be abused or neglected, and in imminent danger may issue ex parte orders pursuant to RSA 169-C:6-a, permitting the child or the alleged perpetrator to be removed from the home at the request of the department or a law enforcement officer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. No child taken into protective custody pursuant to this section shall be securely detained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the refusal of a parent or other person having control of a child to administer or consent to the administration of any psychotropic drug to such child shall not, in and of itself, constitute grounds for the police or a juvenile probation and parole officer to take the child into custody, or for the court to order that such child be taken into custody.  However, if the administration of a decreasing dose of the drug is required during withdrawal from the medication, the refusal may constitute grounds for taking the child into protective custody.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-C:10 Attorneys and Guardians Ad Litem. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In cases brought pursuant to this chapter involving a neglected or abused child, the court shall appoint a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) or other approved program guardian ad litem for the child.  If a CASA or other approved program guardian ad litem is unavailable for appointment, the court may then appoint an attorney or other guardian ad litem as the guardian ad litem for the child.  The court shall not appoint an attorney for any guardian ad litem appointed for the child.  The CASA or other approved program guardian ad litem shall have the same authority and access to information as any other guardian ad litem.  For purposes of this paragraph, "unavailable for appointment'' means that there is no CASA or other approved program guardian ad litem available for appointment by the court following a finding of reasonable cause at the preliminary hearing held under RSA 169-C:15 so that the child's interests may effectively be represented in preparation for and at an adjudicatory hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) In cases involving a neglected or abused child under this chapter, where the child's expressed interests conflict with the recommendation for dispositional orders of the guardian ad litem, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the interests of the child.  In any case of neglect or abuse brought pursuant to this chapter, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent an indigent parent alleged to have neglected or abused his or her child.  In addition, the court may appoint an attorney to represent an indigent parent not alleged to have neglected or abused his or her child if the parent is a household member and such independent legal representation is necessary to protect the parent's interest.  The court shall not appoint an attorney to represent any other persons involved in a case brought under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When an attorney is appointed as counsel for a child, representation may include counsel and investigative, expert and other services, including process to compel the attendance of witnesses, as may be necessary to protect the rights of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The New Hampshire supreme court shall adopt rules regarding the duties and responsibilities of the CASA guardian ad litem or other guardian ad litem appointed for the child.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-C:20 Disposition of a Child With a Disability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any point during the proceedings, the court may, either on its own motion or that of any other person, and if the court contemplates a residential placement, the court shall immediately, join the legally liable school district for the limited purposes of directing the school district to determine whether the child is a child with a disability or of directing the school district to review the services offered or provided under RSA 186-C if the child had already been determined to be a child with a disability.  If the court orders the school district to determine whether the minor is a child with a disability, the school district shall make this determination by treating the order as the equivalent of a referral by the child's parent for special education, and shall conduct any team meetings or evaluations that are required under law when a school district receives a referral by a child's parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Once joined as a party, the legally liable school district shall have full access to all records maintained by the district court under this chapter.  The school district shall also report to the court its determination of whether the minor is a child with a disability, and the basis for such determination.  If the child is determined to be a child with a disability, the school district shall make a recommendation to the court as to where the child's educational needs can be met in accordance with state and federal education laws.  In cases where the court does not follow the school district's recommendation, the court shall issue written findings explaining why the recommendation was not followed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the school district finds or has found that the child is a child with a disability, or if it is found that the child is a child with a disability on appeal from the school district's decision in accordance with the due process procedures of RSA 186-C, the school district shall offer an appropriate educational program and placement in accordance with RSA 186-C.  Financial liability for such education program shall be as determined in RSA 186-C:19-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In an administrative due process hearing conducted by the department of education pursuant to RSA 186-C, a school district shall not provide a hearing officer with information from or copies of records maintained by the court which the school district has accessed pursuant to paragraph II of this section, unless the court issues an order authorizing such a release by the school district in accordance with the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A school district seeking such authorization shall file a motion with the court describing the need for the disclosure in the department of education proceeding, with copies delivered to all parties on the same day the motion is filed with the court;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A motion filed by a school district under this provision shall include, on a separate sheet of paper, the following statement in bold typeface:  "Persons subject to juvenile proceedings have important rights to the confidentiality of juvenile court proceedings.  This motion requests the disclosure of some of that information.  If you object to the disclosure of information, you must file a written objection with the court no later than 10 days after the filing of the school district's notice.  If you fail to object in writing, the court may allow private information to be revealed to the New Hampshire Department of Education hearing officer.'';  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any objection by a party shall be filed with the court no later than 10 days after the filing of the school district's notice with the court, unless such time is extended by the court for good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court shall schedule an expedited hearing on the matter to determine if such information may be released.  The court may rule without a hearing if there is no objection filed or if the school district and a parent or legal guardian or the juvenile, if he or she has reached the age of majority, agree in writing to waive a hearing.  In determining whether to authorize the disclosure of the information requested by the school district, the court shall balance the importance of disclosure of the records to a fair and accurate determination of the merits against the privacy interests of the parties to the proceedings, and render a written decision setting forth its findings and rulings.  No information released to a hearing officer pursuant to this paragraph shall be disclosed to any other person or entity without the written permission of the court, the child's parent or legal guardian, or the juvenile if he or she has reached the age of majority, except that any court reviewing an administrative due process hearing on appeal shall have access to the same information released to a hearing officer pursuant to this paragraph.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Where a child has been in an out-of-home placement pursuant to a finding of child neglect or abuse, under the responsibility of the state, for 12 of the most recent 22 months;

(b) Subparagraph (a) shall not apply to expenses incurred for special education and related services, or to expenses incurred for evaluation, care, and treatment of the child at the New Hampshire hospital or to expenses incurred for the cost of accompanied transportation or to expenses incurred for the cost of alcohol and drug testing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The state shall have a right of action over for such expenses against the parents or the people chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities and the right to require parents or other people chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities to assign to the state any insurance benefits that may be available to pay for all or a portion of the services provided.  The department shall request reimbursement for such expenses from parents or people chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities and shall request assignment to the state of any insurance benefits that may be available to pay for all or a portion of the services provided.  The court shall require the individual chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities to submit a financial statement annually to the court upon which the court shall make an order as to reimbursement to the state as may be reasonable and just, based on the person's ability to pay.  Such financial statement shall include, but not be limited to, any benefits received from the Social Security Administration or insurance benefits available to the individual.  The court shall include disposition of these benefits in its order as to reimbursement.  Such reimbursement shall be established on a per month or per week basis and shall continue from the time the services begin until 4 years beyond the time such services end, unless such reimbursement is fully paid prior to the end of the 4-year period.  The court's jurisdiction to order reimbursement shall continue until the court-ordered obligation to reimburse has been fulfilled.  If the court does not issue a reimbursement order, the court shall issue written findings explaining why such reimbursement is not ordered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Liability for placement expenses for any court ordered placement of any minor mother under this chapter shall include liability for placement expenses for the child or children of such minor mother if the minor mother and child or children are placed at the same facility.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the department shall have no responsibility for the payment of the cost of assigned counsel for any party under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the issuance of the order in paragraph I, the court shall send notice to the state.  The state may, within 30 days from receipt of notice, request a hearing on the issues of the cost or appropriateness of services, or recovery.  At such hearing, the court shall provide all financial information, including names and addresses of persons chargeable by law for the child's support and necessities, to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The office of reimbursements acting on behalf of Laconia developmental services and the New Hampshire hospital is authorized to compromise or reduce any expense to be charged to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department may enter into an agreement with a county to collect, on behalf of the department, payments from persons or entities which are ordered to reimburse the state under paragraph I, or which are chargeable by law for the minor's support and necessities.  An agreement may authorize the county to deduct reasonable administrative costs from the amounts collected.  The balance of any amounts collected by the county pursuant to this paragraph shall be forwarded to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the person responsible for paying reimbursements to the department under paragraph IV is financially able to pay such reimbursements but fails to make such payments, the department may apply to the district court for a lien on such person's real or personal property for the amount of reimbursements due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) For the adoptive parent or prospective adoptive parent of a child in the custody of the state whose birth parents have consented to the adoption, relinquished their parental rights to the department, or the parental rights of whose birth parents were terminated pursuant to a petition brought by the department, authorized agency, or foster parent, pursuant to RSA 170-C:4, the state shall have no right of action against such adoptive parent or prospective adoptive parent for the expenses of services, placements, and programs provided pursuant to RSA 169-B, 169-C, or 169-D after the adoption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the department determines that the adoptive parent has been convicted of sexual or physical abuse of the adopted child pursuant to RSA 631 or 632-A, or the adoptive parent has misappropriated adoption subsidy moneys, the adoptive parent shall be responsible for payment for subsequent services, placements, and programs provided pursuant to RSA 169-B, 169-C, or 169-D after the adoption.  A determination of misappropriation is subject to the provisions of RSA 126-A:5, VIII.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If it appears that the immediate safety or well-being of a child is endangered, the family may flee or the child disappear, or the facts otherwise so warrant, the department shall commence an investigation immediately after receipt of a report.  In all other cases, a child protective investigation shall be commenced within 72 hours of receipt of the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For each report it receives, the department shall promptly perform a child protective investigation to:  (i) determine the composition of the family or household, including the name, address, age, sex and race of each child named in the report, and any siblings or other children in the same household or in the care of the same adults, the parents or other persons responsible for their welfare, and any other adults in the same household;  (ii) determine whether there is probable cause to believe that any child in the family or household is abused or neglected, including a determination of harm or threatened harm to each child, the nature and extent of present or prior injuries, abuse or neglect, and any evidence thereof, and a determination of the person or persons apparently responsible for the abuse or neglect;  (iii) determine the immediate and long-term risk to each child if the child remains in the existing home environment;  and (iv) determine the protective treatment, and ameliorative services that appear necessary to help prevent further child abuse or neglect and to improve the home environment and the parents' ability to adequately care for the children.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon notification by the department that the immediate safety or well-being of a child may be endangered, the court may, in its discretion, order a police officer, juvenile probation and parole officer, or child protection service worker to enter the place where the child is located, in furtherance of such investigation.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the department may, pursuant to a voluntary service plan that is developed and provided for a minor and the minor's family by the department, offer voluntary services to families without making a determination of the person or persons apparently responsible for the abuse or neglect.  The department shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the provision of voluntary services under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the department may, pursuant to a voluntary service plan that is developed and provided for the child by the department, offer voluntary services to any child who prior to his or her eighteenth birthday was found to be neglected or abused, who was in legal custody of the department as of his or her eighteenth birthday, and who is less than 21 years of age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. At the first contact in person, any person investigating a report of abuse or neglect on behalf of the department shall verbally inform the parents of a child suspected of being a victim of abuse or neglect of the specific nature of the charges and that they are under no obligation to allow a social worker or state employee on their premises or surrender their children to interviews unless that social worker or state employee is in possession of a court order to that effect.  Upon receiving such information, the parent shall sign a written acknowledgement indicating that the information required under this paragraph was provided by the person conducting the investigation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There shall be established a state registry for the purpose of maintaining a record of founded reports of abuse and neglect.  The registry shall be confidential and subject to rules on access established by the commissioner of the department under RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt by the department of a written request and verified proof of identity, an individual shall be informed by the department whether that individual's name is listed in the founded reports maintained in the central registry.  It shall be unlawful for any employer other than those specified in RSA 170-E and RSA 170-G:8-c to require as a condition of employment that the employee submit his or her name for review against the central registry of founded reports of abuse and neglect.  Any violation of this provision shall be punishable as a violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Founded reports of abuse and neglect shall be retained for a period of 7 years subject to an individual's right to petition for the earlier removal of his or her name from the central registry as provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any individual whose name is listed in the founded reports maintained on the central registry may petition the district court to have his or her name expunged from the registry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A petition to expunge shall be filed in the district court where the abuse and neglect petition was heard.  In cases where the department makes a finding but no petition is filed with the court, a petition to expunge shall be filed in the district court where the petition for the abuse and neglect could have been brought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A petition to expunge shall be filed on forms promulgated by the district courts and may include any information the petitioner deems relevant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When a petition to expunge is filed, the district court shall require the department to report to the court concerning any additional founded abuse and neglect reports on the petitioner and shall require that the department submit the petitioner's name, birth date, and address to the state police to obtain information about criminal convictions.  The court may require the department to provide any additional information that the court believes may aid it in making a determination on the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon the receipt of the department's report, the court may act on the petition without further hearing or may schedule the matter for hearing at the request of either party.  If the court determines that the petitioner does not pose a present threat to the safety of children, the court shall grant the petition and order the department to remove the individual's name from the central registry.  Otherwise, the petition shall be dismissed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When an individual's name is added to the central registry, the department shall notify individuals of their right to petition to have their name expunged from the central registry.  No petition to expunge shall be brought within one year from the date that the petitioner's name was initially entered on the central registry.  If the petition to expunge is denied, no further petition shall be brought more frequently than every 3 years thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon receipt of a written request from another state's child welfare agency or from a private adoption agency that is licensed or certified in another state to check the central registry established under this section for information on a prospective foster or adoptive parent or any other adult living in the home of such a prospective foster or adoptive parent, the department shall conduct the requested check and shall provide the requesting state or private adoption agency with the results of the check along with such additional information from the department's case records as the department deems necessary for the requesting state or private adoption agency to be able to evaluate the results.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-C:39-a Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislature recognizes that child abuse and neglect are serious societal problems, are threats to the family unit, and result in major expenses to society.  The legislature further declares that there is a need to assist private and public agencies in initiating and enhancing community based educational and service programs for the prevention of these misfortunes.  It is the intent of the legislature to support programs that will reduce conditions leading to child abuse and thus limit the need for future state intervention and expense.  It is further intended that programs for preventing child abuse and neglect will be cooperative ventures of citizens, communities, and the state.  The purpose of this subdivision is to create a new fund to be used exclusively for the prevention of child abuse and neglect, in order to augment funds currently available from federal, state, or local sources for this purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of this subdivision is to provide a new source of funding, to be known as the New Hampshire children's trust fund, which shall increase the funds available for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.  The legislature does not intend that these funds will be used as a substitute for any funds available from federal, state, or local sources for prevention programs;  nor does the legislature intend that these funds will substitute for state appropriations to the budget of the department of health and human services or to any other state agency.
