&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-C:4 Jurisdiction, Continued Jurisdiction, Modification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all proceedings alleging the abuse or neglect of a child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may, with the consent of the child, retain jurisdiction over any child, who, prior to his or her eighteenth birthday, was found to be neglected or abused and who is attending school until such child completes high school or until his or her twenty-first birthday, whichever occurs first;  and the court is authorized to and shall make such orders relative to the support and maintenance of said child during the period after the child's eighteenth birthday as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. A child who has consented to the continued jurisdiction of the court pursuant to paragraph II, may revoke his or her consent and request that the case be closed.  The revocation of consent and request to close a case shall be made in writing and filed with the court.  Upon receipt of the request, the court shall forward copies to all parties of record at their last known address.  If no party objects within 10 business days of the date the court forwarded copies of the request to the parties, the court shall accept the child's revocation of consent and shall close the case.  If a party objects, the court may, after consideration of the objection, either grant the request and close the case without hearing or schedule the matter for hearing.  If the matter is scheduled for hearing, the court shall accept the child's revocation of consent and close the case unless the court finds that immediate closure would create a risk of substantial harm to the child.  If the court finds that immediate closure would create a risk of substantial harm to the child, the court shall continue the matter for a period not to exceed 30 days and direct that the department work with the child to develop an independent living plan which shall include referrals to appropriate services.  If at the end of such period, the child still wishes to revoke his or her consent and to request that the case be closed, the court shall accept the revocation of consent and close the case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a custody award has been made pursuant to this chapter, said order shall not be modified or changed nor shall another order affecting the status of the child be issued by the superior court except on appeal under RSA 169-C:28.
