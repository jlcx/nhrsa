<center><h3>Section 155-A:2</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-A:2 State Building Code. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All buildings, building components, and structures constructed in New Hampshire shall comply with the state building code and state fire code.  The construction, design, structure, maintenance, and use of all buildings or structures to be erected and the alteration, renovation, rehabilitation, repair, removal, or demolition of all buildings and structures previously erected shall be governed by the provisions of the state building code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To the extent that there is any conflict between the state building code and the state fire code, the code creating the greater degree of life safety shall take precedence, subject to the review provisions contained in RSA 155-A:10.  If the municipal building and fire code officials cannot agree which code creates the greater degree of life safety, the property owner may notify the 2 officials in writing that if agreement is not reached within 2 business days of delivery of said notification, that the decision shall be made by the property owner to comply with either the applicable building code or fire code.  Such decision by the property owner after proper notification shall not be grounds for the denial of a certificate of occupancy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To the extent that it does not conflict with any other provision of law, and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the issuance of permits and the collection of fees pursuant to the state building code is expressly reserved for counties, towns, cities, and village districts where such activities have been authorized in accordance with RSA 674:51 and RSA 47:22.  Pursuant to the state fire marshal's authority to enforce the state building code under RSA 155-A:7, I, the fire marshal may establish for municipalities that do not have a building inspector or other enforcement mechanism authorized in RSA 155-A:4, with approval of the commissioner of safety and by rules adopted under RSA 541-A, fees to defray the cost of issuing building permits in accordance with the state building code.  Such fees shall be deposited in the fire standards and training and emergency medical services fund established in RSA 21-P:12-d.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except for buildings owned by the state, the community college system of New Hampshire, or the university system, the issuance of permits and certificates of occupancy pursuant to the state building code is expressly reserved for counties, towns, cities, and village districts.  The state fire marshal shall issue permits and conduct inspections for buildings owned by the state, the community college system of New Hampshire, and the university system.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the state fire marshal from contracting with or authorizing a local enforcement agency or other qualified third party for these services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Counties, towns, cities, and village districts may adopt by ordinance pursuant to RSA 674:51 or RSA 47:22 any additional regulations provided that such regulations are not less stringent than the requirements of the state building code and the state fire code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For any municipality which has not adopted an enforcement mechanism under RSA 674:51, the contractor of the building, building component, or structure shall notify the state fire marshal concerning the type of construction before construction begins excluding one- and 2-family dwellings.  Any municipality that has adopted an enforcement mechanism under RSA 674:51 may contract with a local enforcement agency or a qualified third party for these services as an alternative to establishing the position of building inspector under RSA 674:51, III(c), and such agency or third party shall have the same authority as a building inspector as provided in that section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The contractor of a building, building component, or structure shall be responsible for meeting the minimum requirements of the state building code and state fire code.  No municipality shall be held liable for any failure on the part of a contractor to comply with the provisions of the state building code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as amending, repealing, or superseding any local law, ordinance, code, or regulation, except local code requirements that are less stringent than the state building code or state fire code, and all buildings, building components, and structures shall comply with all applicable state or local building and fire code requirements, land use restrictions including but not limited to subdivision regulations, use and location restrictions, density and dimensional limitations, or historic district laws or ordinances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit or encourage the state to initiate or assume an independent role in the administration and enforcement of the New Hampshire building code for a building or structure that is not owned by the state unless otherwise authorized by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. No state agency, authority, board, or commission shall vary, modify, or waive the requirements of the state building code or state fire code, unless approved by the state building code review board pursuant to RSA 155-A relative to the state building code or the state fire marshal pursuant to RSA 153:8-a, I(c) for the state fire code.  Nothing in this chapter shall affect the statutory authority of the commissioner of labor, the state board for the licensing and regulation of plumbers, or the state electricians' board to administer their respective programs, provided that any changes to codes proposed under the rulemaking authority of these agencies shall not be enforced until approved by the state building code review board.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-A:5 Accessibility Standards for Public Buildings;  Purpose and Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The requirements of this section and RSA 155-A:5-a and RSA 155-A:5-b are intended to establish a system of certification and enforcement for the accessibility standards in the state building code for public buildings.  For purposes of this section, public building means any building that is regulated by the accessibility standards contained in the state building code.  This section is not intended to enlarge upon or expand any substantive standard of the state building code.  This section is intended to apply solely to the new construction, addition, or alteration of a public building that is commenced on or after July 1, 2010 and only to the extent that the new construction, addition, or alteration is regulated by the accessibility standards in the state building code.

<center><h3>Section 155-A:5-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 155-A:5-a Accessibility Standards for Public Buildings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The new construction, addition, or alteration of a public building as described in RSA 155-A:5 and as governed under RSA 155-A:2, I shall be subject to the requirements of this section and RSA 155-A:5-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in paragraph III, the contractor shall obtain and submit to the owner of the public building a written certification from a person qualified under RSA 155-A:5-b that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The design drawings or construction drawings for the proposed new construction, addition, or alteration meets the accessibility standards of the state building code;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon the completion and after inspection, the new construction, addition, or alteration meets the accessibility standards of the state building code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The requirements of paragraph II shall not apply to a public building for which the review of design drawings or construction drawings and inspection of completed work is performed by a municipal building inspector who:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Satisfies the qualifications under RSA 155-A:5-b;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Examines the design drawings or construction drawings prior to the commencement of work and inspects the building upon completion of work for compliance with the accessibility standards in the state building code;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provides the governing body of the municipality with a written certification that the design and construction of the building upon completion of work comply with the accessibility standards of the state building code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring municipalities to inspect and certify public buildings for compliance with accessibility standards.  Public buildings located in a municipality that has chosen to authorize its municipal building inspector to inspect and certify shall remain subject to all other provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to other enforcement authority granted in this chapter, the protection and advocacy system for New Hampshire, as designated by the governor pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 15043, shall have standing to enforce the accessibility standards required by this section.  If the protection and advocacy system determines that probable cause exists that a public building violates the accessibility certification or inspection requirements of this section, it shall issue a letter to the owner of the building specifically identifying the deficiencies and requesting that the building be brought into compliance.  The owner shall have 30 days to respond to the letter and 270 days to bring the building into compliance.  If the owner does not respond, does not agree that there are some or all of the deficiencies asserted, or does not agree to bring the building into compliance within the specified time periods, or any other dispute remains as to compliance, either the owner or the protection and advocacy system may file an action in the superior court to determine compliance with this section.  The protection and advocacy system may bring the action in its name or in the name of any individual with a physical impairment who is adversely affected by the alleged failure to adhere to the accessibility standards of the state building code, or both.  If it is determined by the superior court that the building is not in compliance with the accessibility standards in the state building code, the court shall order that the responsible party bring the building into compliance.  The court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party.  For purposes of this section, a party prevails only if it receives either an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent decree.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any individual with a physical impairment who is adversely affected by the failure to adhere to the requirements of this section shall have a private right of action against the owner pursuant to the procedure established in paragraph V, including the right to court costs and reasonable attorney's fees as the prevailing party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any owner of a public building or contractor who is found by a preponderance of the evidence in a proceeding under this section to have knowingly violated the accessibility standards of the state building code shall be subject to a civil penalty.  The penalties shall be the same as those established by RSA 155-A:8.  All civil penalties shall be deposited into the general fund.  The party bringing the action shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs if it is determined by the court to be the prevailing party.

I. New Hampshire licensed architects, professional engineers, certified building officials, and master code officials may certify building plans and/or inspect public buildings for compliance with the accessibility standards in RSA 155-A:5 and RSA 155-A:5-a without further examination.  Any other person engaged in the business of certifying building plans and/or inspecting public buildings for compliance with accessibility standards required by RSA 155-A:5 and RSA 155-A:5-a shall successfully pass an International Code Council examination that covers the accessibility standards contained in the state building code prior to certifying that a building complies with RSA 155-A:5 and RSA 155-A:5-a.  All accessibility certifiers and inspectors shall complete 2 hours of continuing education related to accessibility codes every 3 years and be able to produce proof of continuing education upon request.
