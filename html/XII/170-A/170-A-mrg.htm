<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE III</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Conditions for Placement</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No sending agency shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of not less than 15 days of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state.  The notice shall contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE IV</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Penalty for Illegal Placement</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state.  Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws.  In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE V</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Retention of Jurisdiction</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency's state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state.  Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law.  The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement.  Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state;  nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE VI</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Institutional Care of Delinquent Children</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to his being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency's jurisdiction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.
<center>
<p>
<b>ARTICLE VII</b>

</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Compact Administrator</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
