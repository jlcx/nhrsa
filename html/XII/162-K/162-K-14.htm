&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-K:14 Advisory Board. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislative body of the municipality shall create an advisory board for each development district.  The board shall consist of such number of members appointed or elected as determined by the legislative body.  A majority of members shall be owners or occupants of real property within or adjacent to the development district.  In a substantially residential development district, however, the board shall consist solely of owners or occupants of real property within or adjacent to the district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The advisory board shall advise the governing body and district administrator on planning, construction and implementation of the development program and on maintenance and operation of the district after the program has been completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The governing body shall by resolution delineate the respective powers and duties of the advisory board and the planning staff or agency.  The resolution shall establish reasonable time limits for consultation by the advisory board on the phases of the development program, and provide a mechanism for appealing to the governing body for a final decision when conflicts arise between the advisory board and the planning staff or agency, regarding the development program in its initial and subsequent stages.
