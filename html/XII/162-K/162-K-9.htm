The municipality shall adopt a tax increment financing plan for any development district established under this chapter.  The plan shall allocate use of tax increments for retirement of bonds and notes, operation, maintenance and improvements in the district and for general municipal purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tax increment financing plan shall contain a statement of objectives of a municipality for improvement of a development district.  Such plan shall be incorporated into the development program for the district.  It shall contain estimates of the following:  cost of the development program;  sources of revenues to finance those costs including estimates of tax increments;  amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred;  and the duration of the program's existence.  The plan shall also contain a statement of the estimated impact of tax increment financing on the assessed values of all taxing jurisdictions in which the district is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before approving any tax increment financing plan, a public hearing shall be held as part of the hearing on the development district under RSA 162-K:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Before formation of a development district, the municipality shall provide a reasonable opportunity to the county commissioners of any county in which any portion of the development district is located and to the members of the school board of any school district in which any portion of the development district is located to meet with the governing body.  The governing body shall fully inform the county commissioners and the school boards of the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed development district.  The county commissioners and the school boards may present their recommendations at the public hearing.  A municipality's tax increment financing plan may include agreements with the county commissioners and the school boards in which the district is located to share a portion of the captured tax increments of the district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A tax increment financing plan may be modified provided such modification shall be approved by the legislative body upon such notice and hearing and agreements as are required for approval of the original plan.  In a case where the financing plan calls for the appropriation of a specific sum of money, the sum of money appropriated thereunder may be decreased or increased by the vote of the legislative body, provided that in a town under the municipal budget act no increase shall be valid which would violate the provisions of RSA 32:18, except as provided in RSA 32:18-a.  Any modification shall maintain use of dedicated tax increments for retirement of bonds and notes as required.
