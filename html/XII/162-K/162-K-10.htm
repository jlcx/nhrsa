(a) Each subsequent year the assessors shall determine current assessed valuation, and tax increments and shall report them to the commissioner of the department of revenue administration according to the following method:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) If the municipality retains the full captured assessed value for the development district the assessors shall certify to the commissioner of revenue administration, for the purposes of the report required by RSA 41:15, the current assessed value, as the basis to equalize annually the valuation of property throughout the state, and the full captured assessed value, to be deducted from the current assessed valuation for the calculation of the property tax rate.  The assessors shall extend all rates as established by the commissioner of revenue administration under the provisions of RSA 41:15 against the current assessed value, including all captured assessed value.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds the original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes paid that year on real property in the district which the captured assessed value bears to the total current assessed value.  The amount so remitted each year is referred to in this section as the tax increment for that year.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) If the municipality retains only a portion of the captured assessed value for the development district and returns the remaining portion to the tax lists, the assessors shall include the current assessed value, to be used as a basis to equalize annually the valuation of property throughout the state, and that portion of the captured assessed value which the municipality does retain, to be deducted from the current assessed valuation for the calculation of the property tax rate.  The assessors shall extend all rates against the total current assessed value.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds the original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes billed on real property in the district that the retained captured assessed value bears to the total current assessed value in the district.  The amount so remitted each year is referred to as the tax increment.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) The general court finds that municipalities that have adopted a tax increment financing plan and issued tax increment financing plan bonds under this chapter before April 29, 1999, or which have adopted a tax increment financing plan and entered into contracts and incurred liabilities in reliance upon the tax increment plans under this chapter before April 29, 1999, have incurred obligations which must be honored.  The general court recognizes also that in accordance with the intent of this chapter, such obligations were entered into in order to accomplish a public purpose and for the improvement of development in municipalities.  Accordingly, the provisions of subparagraph III(a) shall not apply to tax increment financing plan districts which authorized and issued tax increment bonds under this chapter before April 29, 1999 or which adopted a tax increment financing plan under this chapter and entered into contracts and incurred financial liabilities in reliance upon such tax increment plan before April 29, 1999.  This subparagraph shall only apply to tax development districts as they existed as of April 29, 1999.  To the extent such tax increment financing plan is amended to increase the amount of bonded indebtedness, to increase the cost of the development program, or to extend the duration of the program's existence, this subparagraph shall not apply.  The assessors shall determine assessed valuation and tax increments according to the following method:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) If the municipality retains the full captured assessed value for the development district, the assessors shall certify to the commissioner of revenue administration for the purposes of the report required by RSA 21-J:34, no more than the original assessed value of the real property in the development district.  The assessors shall extend all rates as established by the commissioner of revenue administration under the provisions of RSA 21-J:35 against the current assessed value, including all captured assessed value.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds the original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes billed that year on real property in the district which the captured assessed value bears to the total current assessed value.  That amount is referred to in this section as the tax increment for that year.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) If the municipality retains only a portion of the captured assessed value for the development district and returns the excess to the tax lists, the assessors shall certify to the commissioner of revenue administration for the purposes of the report required by RSA 21-J:34 the original assessed value and that portion of the captured assessed value which is shared with all the affected taxing districts for the purposes of determining the assessed value for computing property tax rates.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall compute the rates of all taxes levied by the state, county, municipality, school district and every other taxing district in which the district is located on this aforementioned assessed value.  The assessors shall extend all rates against the total current assessed value, including that portion of the captured assessed value which the municipality is retaining for the development district only.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds that original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes paid on real property in the district that the retained captured value bears to the total current assessed value in the district.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon formation of a development district, the assessors of the municipality in which it is situated shall determine the current assessed value of the real property within the boundaries of the development district.  The current assessed value so determined shall be known as the "original assessed value.''  Property exempt from taxation at the time of the determination shall be included at zero, unless it later becomes taxable, in which case its most recently determined assessed valuation shall be included.  Each year thereafter, the assessors shall determine the amount by which the assessed value has increased or decreased from the original assessed value.  The assessors shall also determine the proportion which any increase or decrease bears to the total assessed value of the real property in that district for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any amount by which the current assessed value of a development district exceeds the original assessed value is referred to as the captured assessed value.  The assessors shall determine the amount of the captured assessed value each year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The tax increment financing plan shall designate the portion of captured assessed value which will be dedicated for retirement of bonds and notes and the portion of captured assessed value which will be dedicated to the operation and further development of the tax increment financing district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The portion of captured assessed value which is not used either for the purpose of retirement of bonds and notes or for the purpose of the operation and development of the tax increment financing district shall be deemed excess captured assessed value.  Excess captured assessed value shall be returned to the tax lists.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Each subsequent year the assessors shall determine current assessed valuation, and tax increments and shall report them to the commissioner of the department of revenue administration according to the following method:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the municipality retains the full captured assessed value for the development district the assessors shall certify to the commissioner of revenue administration, for the purposes of the report required by RSA 41:15, the current assessed value, as the basis to equalize annually the valuation of property throughout the state, and the full captured assessed value, to be deducted from the current assessed valuation for the calculation of the property tax rate.  The assessors shall extend all rates as established by the commissioner of revenue administration under the provisions of RSA 41:15 against the current assessed value, including all captured assessed value.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds the original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes paid that year on real property in the district which the captured assessed value bears to the total current assessed value.  The amount so remitted each year is referred to in this section as the tax increment for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the municipality retains only a portion of the captured assessed value for the development district and returns the remaining portion to the tax lists, the assessors shall include the current assessed value, to be used as a basis to equalize annually the valuation of property throughout the state, and that portion of the captured assessed value which the municipality does retain, to be deducted from the current assessed valuation for the calculation of the property tax rate.  The assessors shall extend all rates against the total current assessed value.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds the original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes billed on real property in the district that the retained captured assessed value bears to the total current assessed value in the district.  The amount so remitted each year is referred to as the tax increment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The general court finds that municipalities that have adopted a tax increment financing plan and issued tax increment financing plan bonds under this chapter before April 29, 1999, or which have adopted a tax increment financing plan and entered into contracts and incurred liabilities in reliance upon the tax increment plans under this chapter before April 29, 1999, have incurred obligations which must be honored.  The general court recognizes also that in accordance with the intent of this chapter, such obligations were entered into in order to accomplish a public purpose and for the improvement of development in municipalities.  Accordingly, the provisions of subparagraph III(a) shall not apply to tax increment financing plan districts which authorized and issued tax increment bonds under this chapter before April 29, 1999 or which adopted a tax increment financing plan under this chapter and entered into contracts and incurred financial liabilities in reliance upon such tax increment plan before April 29, 1999.  This subparagraph shall only apply to tax development districts as they existed as of April 29, 1999.  To the extent such tax increment financing plan is amended to increase the amount of bonded indebtedness, to increase the cost of the development program, or to extend the duration of the program's existence, this subparagraph shall not apply.  The assessors shall determine assessed valuation and tax increments according to the following method:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the municipality retains the full captured assessed value for the development district, the assessors shall certify to the commissioner of revenue administration for the purposes of the report required by RSA 21-J:34, no more than the original assessed value of the real property in the development district.  The assessors shall extend all rates as established by the commissioner of revenue administration under the provisions of RSA 21-J:35 against the current assessed value, including all captured assessed value.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds the original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes billed that year on real property in the district which the captured assessed value bears to the total current assessed value.  That amount is referred to in this section as the tax increment for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the municipality retains only a portion of the captured assessed value for the development district and returns the excess to the tax lists, the assessors shall certify to the commissioner of revenue administration for the purposes of the report required by RSA 21-J:34 the original assessed value and that portion of the captured assessed value which is shared with all the affected taxing districts for the purposes of determining the assessed value for computing property tax rates.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall compute the rates of all taxes levied by the state, county, municipality, school district and every other taxing district in which the district is located on this aforementioned assessed value.  The assessors shall extend all rates against the total current assessed value, including that portion of the captured assessed value which the municipality is retaining for the development district only.  In each year for which the current assessed value exceeds that original assessed value, the municipal tax collector shall remit to the municipality that proportion of all taxes paid on real property in the district that the retained captured value bears to the total current assessed value in the district.  That amount is referred to as the tax increment for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In any year in which the current assessed value of the development district is equal to or less than the original assessed value, the assessors shall compute and extend taxes against the current value.  Taxes shall be distributed from the affected property to each of the taxing authorities as determined by the current levy and there is no tax increment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The municipality shall expend the tax increments received for any development program only in accordance with the tax increment financing plan.  Tax increments shall be used only to pay off costs and administrative expenses incurred in developing the district.
