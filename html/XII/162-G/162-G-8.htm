II. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph I of this section, one or more municipalities acting through a business and industrial development authority may acquire facilities, purchase options to buy business and industrial facilities, and execute agreements to purchase leases and notes and mortgages with respect thereto, if such business and industrial development authority makes the findings and determinations required under paragraph I, provided that no contract entered into by any business and industrial development authority under this section shall commit any municipality to make expenditures in excess of the total of appropriations by the individual municipality's legislative body specifically for meeting the commitments made and the income from leases and subleases of the subject premises.  In all instances the public benefit shall be demonstrable.
