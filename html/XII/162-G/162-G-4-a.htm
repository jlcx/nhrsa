I. The sale or lease of any business and industrial facility or any part thereof shall be on such terms and conditions as is deemed appropriate by the legislative body or the business and industrial development authority to which the power to make such findings has been delegated, except that no property of the municipality shall be sold or leased for less than the value of such property as determined by the legislative body or the business and industrial development authority.  In the case of findings made by the legislative body as to value of the property for the purpose of its sale or lease, the legislative body shall obtain and consider an opinion as to its value for such purpose furnished by a qualified, independent real estate appraiser certified under RSA 310-B.  Any determination of value reached by the legislative body or the business and industrial development authority in good faith shall be conclusive.  If the business and industrial development authority determines the value of the property then, in all instances, the public benefit shall be demonstrable in actions entered into by the business and industrial development authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In all lease actions entered into by a business and industrial development authority or governmental unit, public benefit shall be demonstrable.
