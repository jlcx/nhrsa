&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-G:2 Declaration of Need and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared that there is a need for the development and preservation of business and industry within the state in order to alleviate and prevent unemployment, to insure the continued growth and prosperity of the state, and of the cities and towns within the state and to promote the general welfare of all its citizens.  It is the purpose of this chapter to authorize the cities and towns of the state to foster and encourage the development of business and industrial facilities within or without their respective boundaries, acting directly or through a business and industrial development authority or a voluntary, nonprofit corporation, alone or in concert with one or more other governmental units, by acquiring, developing, expanding, leasing, and disposing of such facilities, where such development is more appropriate under this chapter than under RSA 162-A, as determined by the governing body.  It is further declared that the acquisition of title to such facilities, either directly or through a business and industrial development authority or a voluntary, nonprofit corporation, and the lease or sale of such facilities as provided hereunder is a public purpose and shall be regarded as performing an essential governmental function in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.  However, competition among communities in this state merely for the purpose of seeking relocation of business and industrial facilities located in this state is contrary to the policy of this chapter.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any municipality or other political subdivision enabled to adopt the provisions of RSA 162-G may, by similar action, adopt the provisions of this section.  Any such municipality or other political subdivision which adopts the provisions of this section may engage in projects under RSA 162-G which have as their purpose the improvement of the furnishing of water for domestic, industrial, agricultural, or other uses, if the water for such uses is to be available on reasonable demand to members of the general public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section:  "business and industrial facility'' shall include and mean any facility suitable for collecting, purifying, storing, or distributing water for the aforesaid uses and shall hereinafter be called a "water facility'';  "lease'' shall include any conveyance or contract, however titled or described, providing for the use and operation of a water facility;  "tenant'' shall mean any corporation which is organized under the laws of this state for the purpose of furnishing water for any one or more of the uses described above and which is responsible for the use and operation of a water facility under a lease;  and "trust indenture'' shall include any conveyance, contract, or assignment to a trustee or other person to secure bonds issued to finance a water facility.
