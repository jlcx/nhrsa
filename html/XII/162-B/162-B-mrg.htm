&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-B:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state of New Hampshire endorses the action of the Congress of the United States in enacting the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to institute a program to encourage the widespread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes to the maximum extent consistent with the common defense and security and with the health and safety of the public;  and therefore declares the policy of the state to be, (1) To cooperate actively in the program thus instituted;  and (2) To the extent that the regulation of special nuclear materials and by-product materials, of production facilities and utilization facilities, and of persons operating such facilities, may be within the jurisdiction of the state, to provide for the exercise of the state's regulatory authority so as to conform, as nearly as may be, to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and regulations issued thereunder, to the end that there may, in effect, be a single harmonious system of regulation within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state of New Hampshire recognizes that the development of industries producing or utilizing atomic energy may result in new conditions calling for changes in the laws of the state and in regulations issued thereunder with respect to health and safety, working conditions, workers' compensation, transportation, public utilities, life, health, accident, fire, and casualty insurance, the conservation of natural resources, including wildlife, and the protection of streams, rivers and airspace from pollution, and therefore declares the policy of the state to be, (1) To adapt its laws and regulations to meet the new conditions in ways that will encourage the healthy development of industries producing or utilizing atomic energy while at the same time protecting the public interest;  and (2) To initiate continuing studies of the need for changes in the relevant laws and regulations of the state by the respective departments and agencies of state government responsible for their administration;  and (3) To assure the coordination of the studies thus undertaken, particularly with other atomic industrial development activities of the state and with the development and regulatory activities of other states and of the government of the United States.

<codesect>
Each of the following departments and agencies of the state government is directed to initiate and to pursue continuing studies as to the need, if any, for changes in the laws and regulations administered by it that would arise from the presence within the state of special nuclear materials and by-product materials and from the operation herein of production or utilization facilities, and, on the basis of such studies, to make such recommendations for the enactment of laws or amendments to laws administered by it, and such proposals for amendments to the regulations issued by it, as may appear necessary and appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of health and human services, particularly as to hazards, if any, to the public health and safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of labor, particularly as to hazardous working conditions, if any, the time and character of proof of claims of injuries and the extent of the compensation allowable therefor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department of transportation, particularly as to the transportation of special nuclear materials and by-product materials on highways of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The public utilities commission, particularly as to the transportation of special nuclear materials and by-product materials by common carriers or public or private air carriers not in interstate commerce and as to the participation by public utilities subject to its jurisdiction in projects looking to the development of production or utilization facilities for industrial or commercial use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department of insurance, particularly as to the insurance of persons and property from hazards to life and property resulting from atomic development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The council on resources and development, particularly as to the hazards, if any, to the natural resources of the state, including wildlife, and as to the protection, if necessary, of rivers, streams, and airspace from pollution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Such other departments and agencies including departments and agencies of political subdivisions of the state as the governor may direct and for the purposes specified by him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 162-B:4 Coordination of Studies and Development Activities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governor and council shall appoint the head of one of the state departments concerned as adviser to the governor with respect to atomic industrial development within the state;  as coordinator of the development and regulatory activities of the state government relating to the industrial and commercial uses of atomic energy;  and as deputy of the governor in matters relating to atomic energy, including participation in the activities of any committee formed by the New England states to represent their interest in such matters and also cooperation with other states and with the government of the United States.  The department head so appointed shall have the additional title of Coordinator of Atomic Development Activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The coordinator of atomic development activities shall have the duty of coordinating the studies, recommendations, and proposals of the several departments and agencies of the state government required by RSA 162-B:3 with each other and also with the programs and activities of the department of resources and economic development of the state.  So far as may be practicable, he shall coordinate the studies conducted, and the recommendations and proposals made, in this state with like activities in the New England and other states and with the policies and regulations of the United States Atomic Energy Commission.  In carrying out his duties, he shall proceed in close cooperation with the department of resources and economic development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The several departments and agencies of the state government which are directed by RSA 162-B:3 to initiate and pursue continuing studies are further directed to keep the coordinator of atomic development activities fully and currently informed as to their activities relating to atomic energy.  No regulation or amendment to a regulation applying specifically to an atomic energy matter shall become effective until 30 days after it has been submitted to the coordinator, unless, upon a finding of emergency need, the governor by order waives all or any part of this 30-day period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The coordinator of atomic development activities shall keep the governor and council and the several interested departments and agencies informed at least biennially as to private and public activities affecting atomic industrial development and shall enlist their cooperation in taking action to further such development as is consistent with the health, safety and general welfare of this state.
