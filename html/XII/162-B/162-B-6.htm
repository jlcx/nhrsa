As used in this chapter,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The term "atomic energy'' means all forms of energy released in the course of nuclear fission or nuclear transformation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The term "by-product material'' means any radioactive materials (except special nuclear materials) yielded in or made radioactive by exposure to the radiation incident to the process of producing or utilizing special nuclear materials.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The term "production facility'' means (1) any equipment or device capable of the production of special nuclear material in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security, or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public;  or (2) any important component part especially designed for such equipment or device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The term "special nuclear material'' means (1) plutonium and uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material which the governor declares by order to be special nuclear material after the United States Atomic Energy Commission has determined the material to be such;  or (2) any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The term "utilization facility'' means (1) any equipment or device, except an atomic weapon, capable of making use of special nuclear materials in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security, or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public, or peculiarly adapted for making use of atomic energy in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security, or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public;  or (2) any important component part especially designed for such equipment or device.
