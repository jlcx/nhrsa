&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 159:6-e Violation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any person aggrieved by a violation of the licensing sections of this chapter by a licensing entity may petition the superior court of the county in which the alleged violation occurred for injunctive relief.  The court shall give proceedings under this chapter priority on the court calendar.  Such a petitioner may appear with or without counsel.  The petition shall be deemed sufficient if it states facts constituting a violation of the licensing sections of this chapter by the licensing entity, and may be filed by the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel with the clerk of court or the justice.  The clerk of court or any justice shall order service by copy of the petition on the licensing entity or a person employed by the entity.  If the justice finds that time is of the essence, the justice may order notice by any reasonable means, and shall have authority to issue an order ex parte when the justice reasonably deems such an order necessary to insure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
