<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every child subject to revocation of parole has the right to the assistance of counsel, which may not be waived except following consultation between the child and a parent or counsel.  Consultation between a child and parent is not sufficient to support waiver under this section if the parent was a victim or complainant in the underlying proceeding or is a witness or provided information in support of the basis for revocation in the parole revocation proceeding.  Children known to the department or the board to have an emotional disorder, intellectual disability, or any other condition which may be expected to interfere with a child's ability to understand the proceedings, make decisions, or otherwise handle the proceedings without the assistance of counsel may not waive their right to counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of this section, a child shall be considered a child who is subject to a parole revocation proceeding if the child has been released pursuant to RSA 170-H:5 or RSA 621:19, I for longer than a total of 30 days during one or more periods of release and is subject to return under RSA 621:25.
