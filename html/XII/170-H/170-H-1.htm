<codesect>
It is the intent of the general court that the juvenile parole system provide a means of rehabilitating delinquents who have been committed to the custody of the department of health and human services, without continued incarceration.  It is also the intent of the general court that the juvenile parole board and the department of health and human services, when administering this system, demonstrate recognition of the need to protect the public from criminal acts by juvenile parolees.
