<codesect>
A missing child's parents, custodial parent, guardian, or legal custodian, or any other person responsible for a missing child, shall immediately notify the law enforcement agency with which they filed the missing child report whenever the child has returned to their home or to their care, custody, and control, has been released if he was the victim of an offense under RSA 633, or has otherwise been located.  Upon such notification or upon otherwise learning that a missing child has returned to the home of, or to the care, custody, and control of his parents, custodial parent, guardian, or legal custodian, or other person responsible for him, or has been released if he was the victim of an offense under RSA 633, or otherwise has been located, the law enforcement agency involved shall promptly integrate the fact that the minor is no longer a missing child into the national crime information center computer.
