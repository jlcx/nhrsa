&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-E:3 Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a missing child report is made to a law enforcement agency in this state that has jurisdiction in the matter, the law enforcement agency shall gather readily available information about the missing child and integrate it into the national crime information center computer within 12 hours following the making of the report, unless extraordinary circumstances cause a delay.  The law enforcement agency shall make reasonable efforts to acquire additional information about the missing child following the transmittal of the initially available information, and promptly integrate any additional information acquired into such computer system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The parents, custodial parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person responsible for the missing child shall provide available information upon request, and may provide information voluntarily, to the law enforcement agency during the information gathering process.  The law enforcement agency also may obtain available information about the missing child from other persons, subject to constitutional and statutory limitations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the filing of a missing child report, the law enforcement agency involved promptly shall make a reasonable attempt to notify other law enforcement agencies within its county and, if the agency has jurisdiction in a city, town, or unorganized or unincorporated place that borders another county, to notify the law enforcement agency for the city, town, or unorganized or unincorporated place in the other county with which it shares the border, that it has taken a missing child report and may be requesting assistance or cooperation in the case, and provide relevant information to the other law enforcement agencies.  The agency may notify additional law enforcement agencies and appropriate county providers of human services exercising children services functions, about the case, request their assistance or cooperation in the case, and provide them with relevant information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon request from a law enforcement agency, a county provider of human services exercising children services functions shall grant the law enforcement agency access to all information concerning a missing child that the provider possesses that may be relevant to the law enforcement agency in investigating a missing child report concerning that child.  The information obtained by the law enforcement agency shall only be used to further the investigation to locate the missing child.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 169-E:5 Dental Records. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When a missing child has not been located within 30 days after the date on which his missing child report was filed with a law enforcement agency, that law enforcement agency shall request the missing child's parents, custodial parent, guardian, or legal custodian, or any other person responsible for the missing child, to provide written consent for the law enforcement agency to contact the missing child's dentist and request the missing child's dental records.  Upon receipt of such written consent, the dentist shall release a copy of the missing child's dental records to the law enforcement agency and shall provide and encode the records in such form as requested by the law enforcement agency.  The law enforcement agency shall then integrate information in the records into the national crime information center computer in order to compare the records to those of unidentified deceased persons.  This section shall not prevent a law enforcement agency from seeking consent to obtain copies of a missing child's dental records, or prevent a missing child's parents, custodial parent, guardian, or legal custodian, or any other person responsible for the missing child, from granting consent for the release of copies of the missing child's dental records to a law enforcement agency, at any time.
