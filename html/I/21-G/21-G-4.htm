&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-G:4 Guidelines for Reorganization. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following provisions shall serve as general guidelines for accomplishing executive branch reorganization consistent with the policy and objectives of the state:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In order to allow the chief executive to efficiently and effectively implement legislative policy and programs, the governor should be provided with a manageable administrative structure and the authority to direct its operations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The large number of existing executive branch agencies, departments, boards, commissions, authorities and institutions should be significantly reduced by consolidating them into a reasonable number of departments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The consolidation of agencies in the executive branch should be on a functional basis, so that programs can be coordinated and comprehensive planning can be undertaken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Structural reorganization should be a continuing process through careful executive and legislative appraisal of the placement of proposed new programs, and the coordination of existing programs, in response to changing public needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. There should be a uniform process for administrative appeals to an impartial body provided for each department established following July 1, 1983.
