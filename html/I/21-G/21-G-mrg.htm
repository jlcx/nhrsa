<codesect>
This chapter shall be known as the Executive Branch Reorganization Act of 1983.

<center><h3>Section 21-G:2</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-G:2 Declaration of Findings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state constitution provides for the separation of powers within state government among the legislative, the executive and the judicial branches.  The legislative branch has the broad objective and responsibility to determine policies and programs and to review and oversee program performance and implementation of policy previously established.  The executive branch has the responsibility to implement and administer these policies and programs.  The judicial branch has the responsibility to resolve disputes arising from the interpretation or application of the laws;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The growth of the executive branch from 32 constitutional offices and state agencies in 1900, to 96 in 1970, to more than 140 in 1983, has created an unwieldy and confusing state government structure.  This structure has developed piecemeal, resulting in lack of policy coordination, excessive costs, inefficient use of personnel and capital, overlapping agency jurisdictions, duplication, and the ineffective use of the state's limited financial resources;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The size and complexity of the executive branch, including the unnecessarily confusing current array of administrative terms, titles, and appointment processes, has unintentionally altered some of the constitutionally contemplated checks and balances by an unplanned shifting of policy direction and implementation toward the independent, non-elected executive branch agencies.  This reduces the ability of the legislature to assert its primary role as policymaker and the ability of the governor to manage the implementation of that policy.

<center><h3>Section 21-G:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-G:3 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court declares the following to be the policy and objectives of the state:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The organization of state government should assure its responsiveness to popular control, as expressed through the state's elected officials.  It is the goal of reorganization to improve legislative policymaking capability and to improve the administrative capability of the executive to carry out these policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The organization of state government should facilitate communication between citizens and government.  It is the goal of reorganization through coordination of related programs in function-oriented departments to improve public understanding of government programs and policies, by more clearly defining the jurisdiction of departments, and to improve the relationships between citizens and administrative agencies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The organization of state government should assure efficient, effective and responsive administration of the policies established by the legislature.  It is the goal of reorganization to improve the coordination and management of state services by establishing clear lines of authority, responsibility and accountability for program implementation within the executive branch.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The governor should meet regularly with the heads of all agencies.  Communication and exchange of information and ideas among the agency heads, as well as between agency heads and the governor, should be the goal of these meetings.

<center><h3>Section 21-G:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-G:4 Guidelines for Reorganization. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following provisions shall serve as general guidelines for accomplishing executive branch reorganization consistent with the policy and objectives of the state:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In order to allow the chief executive to efficiently and effectively implement legislative policy and programs, the governor should be provided with a manageable administrative structure and the authority to direct its operations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The large number of existing executive branch agencies, departments, boards, commissions, authorities and institutions should be significantly reduced by consolidating them into a reasonable number of departments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The consolidation of agencies in the executive branch should be on a functional basis, so that programs can be coordinated and comprehensive planning can be undertaken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Structural reorganization should be a continuing process through careful executive and legislative appraisal of the placement of proposed new programs, and the coordination of existing programs, in response to changing public needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. There should be a uniform process for administrative appeals to an impartial body provided for each department established following July 1, 1983.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-G:31 Complaints;  Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each complaint shall be submitted in writing and signed under oath by the complainant.  The sworn complaint shall be filed confidentially with the committee and shall contain the name and address of the complainant.  Before any other action is taken by the committee, the executive branch official complained against shall be furnished with a copy of the complaint and a copy shall be sent to each member of the committee for review.  The committee may initiate a complaint on its own motion against any individual the committee has reason to believe has violated any law, guideline, rule, or regulation within the committee's jurisdiction.  The committee shall promptly examine each sworn complaint and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon first examination, if by a unanimous vote of all members present it determines that a complaint is frivolous, scurrilous, retaliatory in nature, or plainly not within the committee's jurisdiction, the committee may summarily discharge the complaint without further meeting or proceeding.  The committee shall notify the respondent and complainant in writing of its action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For any complaint not summarily discharged, the committee shall conduct an initial review to ascertain whether the committee has jurisdiction to consider the complaint or whether the complaint is without merit or is unfounded.  If the committee concludes that the alleged conduct is not within the committee's jurisdiction, is without merit, or is unfounded, the committee shall dismiss the complaint and shall report such conclusion to the complainant and to the executive branch official, with an explanation of the basis of such determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the committee, by recorded vote, concludes that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and may have merit, the committee may proceed to conduct a preliminary investigation.  Upon completion of its preliminary investigation, the committee shall conclude by recorded vote that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No violation occurred and no further action is appropriate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The violation is inadvertent, technical, or of a <i>de minimis</i> nature and shall be addressed by informal methods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) There are reasonable grounds to believe a violation occurred and formal proceedings shall be instituted to inquire further into the complaint.  In that event, the committee shall issue a formal statement of charges and proceed to a hearing on the complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon completion of the hearing, the committee shall conclude by recorded vote that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No violation occurred and no further action is appropriate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No action is appropriate because there is not clear and convincing evidence that a violation occurred;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Based upon clear and convincing evidence, a violation occurred, but such violation does not justify formal disciplinary action and shall be resolved by informal methods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Based upon clear and convincing evidence, a violation occurred, and the violation was of a serious nature so as to warrant formal action.  In the case of a finding of violation by a former executive branch official, the committee may issue a censure.  In the case of a finding of violation by a current executive branch official, the committee may issue a censure or recommend disciplinary action by the appropriate body, including but not limited to a recommendation for disciplinary action by the executive branch official's supervisor, removal from office under RSA 4:1, or, in the case of the governor, executive council member, or other officer of the state, impeachment or other appropriate action pursuant to part II, article 38 of the New Hampshire constitution.  In addition to any action taken under this subparagraph, the committee may refer the case to the department of justice for criminal prosecution.  In the event that conduct may constitute both a criminal act and misconduct subject to the jurisdiction of the committee, the committee may on its own motion or by motion of the attorney general suspend its investigation or a pending hearing for the time period reasonably necessary to avoid compromising a criminal prosecution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person who knowingly or willfully swears falsely to a sworn complaint does so under penalty of perjury, and the committee may refer any such case to the department of justice for prosecution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and notwithstanding any other provision of law, all proceedings, information, communications, materials, papers, files, and transcripts, written or oral, received or developed by the committee in the course of its work, shall be confidential.  The committee shall first examine any sworn complaint and shall conduct its initial review and preliminary investigation of complaints in a confidential manner, unless otherwise requested by the executive branch official complained against.  The committee shall conduct formal proceedings, other than its deliberations, in public session.  The committee's deliberations on complaints shall be conducted in nonpublic session.  Upon completion of the preliminary investigation conducted under paragraph II or at the conclusion of formal proceedings under paragraph III, the committee shall make available for public inspection all records, other than its work product and internal memoranda relating to the complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In proceedings under this subdivision, the committee shall have the power to issue subpoenas and administer oaths.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any member of the committee who is directly or indirectly involved in any complaint before the committee or who otherwise has personal knowledge of facts material to the determination of the complaint shall not participate in any proceedings regarding the complaint.  In the event that recusals under this paragraph reduce the number of participating members to fewer than 4, the remaining participating members shall designate an alternate or alternates sufficient to increase the committee to 4 members, to serve on the committee for that case only.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-G:37 Financial Information Regarding Requests for Bids or Requests for Proposals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In order to protect the integrity of the bidding process, notwithstanding RSA 91-A:4, no information shall be available to the public, or to the members of the general court or its staff concerning specific responses to requests for bids (RFBs), requests for proposals (RFPs), requests for applications (RFAs), or similar requests for submission for the purpose of procuring goods or services or awarding contracts from the time the request is made public until the closing date for responses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. On the closing date for responses, the agency shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of an RFB, hold a public bid opening at which it shall disclose the name of the bidders which submitted timely bids and the prices offered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of an RFP, RFA, or similar request for submission, post the number of responses received on the agency website.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding RSA 91-A:4, no information other than that specified in paragraph II shall be available to the public or to the members of the general court or its staff concerning specific RFBs, RFPs, RFAs, or similar requests for submission made by any state agency from the closing date for responses until the contract negotiations with the selected vendor are completed, as determined by the issuing agency except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of an RFB that requires approval from the governor and executive council, the issuing agency shall, at least 5 business days prior to submitting the contract to the department of administrative services, post the vendors' names and respective prices for each responding vendor on its website.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of an RFB that does not require approval from the governor and executive council, the issuing agency shall, at minimum, post the vendors' names and respective prices for each responding vendor on its website at the time that the RFB is awarded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the case of an RFP, RFA, or similar request for submission that requires approval from the governor and executive council, the issuing agency shall, at least 5 business days prior to submitting the proposed contract to the department of administrative services, post the rank or score for each responding vendor on its website.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the case of an RFP, RFA, or similar request for submission that does not require approval from the governor and executive council, the issuing agency shall, at least 5 business days before final approval of the proposed contract by the appropriate agency authority, post the rank or score for each responding vendor on its website.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A bidder questioning an agency's identification of the selected vendor may request that the agency review its selection process.  Such request shall be made in writing and be received by the agency within 5 business days after the rank or score is posted on the agency website.  The request shall specify all points on which the bidder believes the agency erred in its process and shall contain such argument in support of its position as the bidder seeks to present.  In response, the issuing agency shall review the process it followed for evaluating responses and, within 5 business days of receiving the request for review, issue a written response either affirming its initial selection of a vendor or canceling the bid.  In its request for review, a bidder shall not submit, and an agency shall not accept nor consider, any substantive information that was not included by the bidder in its original bid response.  No hearing shall be held in conjunction with a review.  The outcome of the agency's review shall not be subject to appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The head of the issuing agency may waive the requirements of paragraphs II through IV in the event of an emergency situation or to prevent the loss of federal or other funds subject to recapture.  Each agency shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to circumstances constituting an emergency or loss of funding under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) When an agency cancels an RFB, RFP, RFA, or similar request for submission, terminates the selection process, or otherwise does not select a bidder, no information shall be available to the public or to the members of the general court or its staff concerning the RFB, RFP, RFA, or similar request for submission, notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 91-A:4, for a period of 2 years following the cancellation, termination, or other non-selection, subject to subparagraph (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If, within 2 years following the cancellation, termination, or other non-selection, a new RFB, RFP, RFA, or similar request for submissions is issued, which the issuing agency determines is substantially related to the original RFB, RFP, RFA, or similar request for submission, information concerning the original bid or proposal shall, if requested and upon payment of any costs established pursuant to RSA 91-A:4, IV, be made available only after selection of a bidder on the new request for submission, but only to the extent that such information is not exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A:5 or other law.
