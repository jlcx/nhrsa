I. The general court hereby specifically states that this chapter is in no way and to no extent intended to, nor shall it be construed in any manner to, impair the contractual or other obligations of any agency abolished by the general court or of the state of New Hampshire.  It is hereby specifically provided that all obligations of any agency abolished, whose powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities are transferred in accordance with this chapter, hereafter shall be deemed to be the obligations of the department to which the powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of the agency are transferred, and of its commissioner, to the same extent as if originally made by them.  In like manner, and in order to prevent any violation of the provisions, terms, or conditions of any gift, donation, deed, will, trust, or other instrument or disposition by which property of any kind has been vested in an agency abolished by the general court, or diversion from the purposes for which such property was thus vested in any such agency, it is hereby specifically provided that each such instrument or disposition hereafter shall be deemed to have been vested in the department to which the powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of the agency are transferred, and its commissioner, in the same manner and to the same extent as if originally so done.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department to which the powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of each such agency are transferred and its commissioner shall be the successor in every way to each such agency, including all of the obligations and debts of each such agency.  All funds heretofore dedicated by or under authority of the constitution and laws of this state, or any of its subdivisions, to the payment of any bonds issued for construction or improvements for any institution or facility under the control of any such agency shall continue to be collected and dedicated to the payment of those bonds.  In like manner, all other dedications and allocations of revenues and sources of revenues heretofore made shall continue in the same manner, to the same extent, and for the same purposes as were provided prior to the enactment of this chapter, and shall so continue, notwithstanding the passage of any laws by the general court relative to reorganization of the executive branch.
