&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 6-A:10 Refunding Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governor and council may authorize the issuance of refunding bonds in order to pay, at maturity or upon earlier redemption or acceleration, all or part of any issue of bonds then outstanding that were issued by the state or with a direct state guarantee;  provided, however, that unless the governor and council specifically provide otherwise no such bonds shall be issued unless the treasurer determines that the present value, discounted at such rate as the treasurer deems appropriate, of the principal and interest payments on the refunding bonds is less than the present value, discounted at the same rate, of the principal and interest payments on the bonds to be refunded.  The proceeds of such refunding bonds may be used to pay the principal of the refunded bonds, any redemption premium thereon, all or part of the interest coming due on or prior to the date or dates on which the refunded bonds are paid, and the costs of issuing and marketing the refunding bonds.  The issue of refunding bonds shall be subject to the same requirements and provisions of law as would then be applicable to the issue of the bonds being refunded, except as provided in this section.  The proceeds of refunding bonds, exclusive of any amounts used to pay costs of issuing and marketing the refunding bonds, shall be held in a separate fund and in trust until they are applied to pay bonds.  While such proceeds are held in trust they may be invested in accordance with RSA 6:7 and RSA 6:8 and the income derived from such investment may be expended by the treasurer to pay the principal of, redemption premium if any, and interest on the refunded bonds until they are paid.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 6-A:11 Revenue Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governor and council may authorize the state treasurer to issue revenue bonds in accordance with this section.  Revenue bonds may be authorized whenever the proceeds of such bonds are to be used for revenue-producing facilities or to refund bonds, the principal of which was used for revenue-producing facilities, and the revenues from such facilities are expected to be sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on such bonds.  As used in this section, revenue-producing facilities means any facility from the operation of which revenues are to be derived by the state.  The proceedings authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds shall contain a description of the facilities financed or to be financed and the revenue generated or expected to be generated by said facility.  The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be paid solely from the revenue generated by the facility constructed.  In authorizing the issuance of such bonds, the governor and council are hereby empowered to pledge and dedicate the revenue from such facility to be used first to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on said bonds as the same become due and the state treasurer shall keep such revenue in a separate account for such purpose and is hereby authorized to expend the same for such purpose.  Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section shall not be considered a pledge of the faith and credit of the state and shall not be deemed debt of the state in determining its borrowing capacity under any applicable law.  All provisions of RSA 6-A not inconsistent with the provision of this section shall be applicable to revenue bonds issued hereunder.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 6-A:12 Bonds Sold at Discount or Premium. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For the purpose of determining the amount of bonds issued by the state pursuant to this chapter or any other law, the amount of any issue of bonds shall be equal to the net proceeds thereof, determined by adding to the face amount of the bond issue the premium, if any, related to bonds of that issue and then subtracting the discount, if any, related to bonds of that issue, provided that the state treasurer may apply all or a portion of any premium received on the sale of any such bonds, without appropriation, to the costs of issuing such bonds or to the credit of the general fund, in which case the amount of any premium so applied shall not be included in the net proceeds of the issue.  The amount of bonds of any such issue considered outstanding at any time, for the purpose of computing any statutory debt limit, shall be determined by multiplying the face amount of the bonds of that issue then outstanding by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net proceeds of the issue as determined above, and the denominator of which is the face amount of the issue.  For the purpose of determining the amount of bond proceeds expended by the state for purposes specified by any law, such proceeds shall be equal to the expenditure of the net proceeds of the issue, as determined above.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 6-A:13 Cost of Debt Issuance;  Application of Premium. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The state treasurer may incur bond issuance costs which may be offset with any bond premiums, if applicable, for bonds sold under this chapter as determined by the state treasurer.  Any remaining premium shall be included in the calculation of net proceeds of an issue or credited to the general fund as determined by the state treasurer pursuant to RSA 6-A:12.  In order to provide funds to pay the cost of issuing bonds, the governor, upon request of the state treasurer, shall draw a warrant for such payments out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated from each fund as appropriate.
