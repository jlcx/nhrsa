&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 9-B:1 Findings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In addition to clean water and air, productive mountain, forest, and agricultural open space land is one of the state's most valuable assets, and is necessary for the economy and health and welfare of the citizens.  The maintenance of this asset is vital if the state is to provide future generations with the same quality of life and environment that we have traditionally enjoyed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Economic development is essential to the well-being and prosperity of our citizens.  However, when haphazard development sprawls across the state's landscape, our collective well-being suffers.  Fortunately, economic development can take place in a form that maximizes smart growth.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state can encourage development in accordance with this chapter by regularly reviewing its operating procedures, granting policies, and regulatory framework.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A coordinated and comprehensive planning effort by state agencies on future development in the state is needed, which will not only improve our economy, but also encourages smart growth by locating development in appropriate growth areas and thus retaining as much open space land as possible for the long-term.
