In this chapter, "smart growth'' means the control of haphazard and unplanned development and the use of land which results over time, in the inflation of the amount of land used per unit of human development, and of the degree of dispersal between such land areas. "Smart growth'' also means the development and use of land in such a manner that its physical, visual, or audible consequences are appropriate to the traditional and historic New Hampshire landscape.  Smart growth may include denser development of existing communities, encouragement of mixed uses in such communities, the protection of villages, and planning so as to create ease of movement within and among communities.  Smart growth preserves the integrity of open space in agricultural, forested, and undeveloped areas.  The results of smart growth may include, but shall not be limited to:
