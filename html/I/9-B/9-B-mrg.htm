&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 9-B:1 Findings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In addition to clean water and air, productive mountain, forest, and agricultural open space land is one of the state's most valuable assets, and is necessary for the economy and health and welfare of the citizens.  The maintenance of this asset is vital if the state is to provide future generations with the same quality of life and environment that we have traditionally enjoyed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Economic development is essential to the well-being and prosperity of our citizens.  However, when haphazard development sprawls across the state's landscape, our collective well-being suffers.  Fortunately, economic development can take place in a form that maximizes smart growth.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state can encourage development in accordance with this chapter by regularly reviewing its operating procedures, granting policies, and regulatory framework.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A coordinated and comprehensive planning effort by state agencies on future development in the state is needed, which will not only improve our economy, but also encourages smart growth by locating development in appropriate growth areas and thus retaining as much open space land as possible for the long-term.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 9-B:3 Definition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter, "smart growth'' means the control of haphazard and unplanned development and the use of land which results over time, in the inflation of the amount of land used per unit of human development, and of the degree of dispersal between such land areas. "Smart growth'' also means the development and use of land in such a manner that its physical, visual, or audible consequences are appropriate to the traditional and historic New Hampshire landscape.  Smart growth may include denser development of existing communities, encouragement of mixed uses in such communities, the protection of villages, and planning so as to create ease of movement within and among communities.  Smart growth preserves the integrity of open space in agricultural, forested, and undeveloped areas.  The results of smart growth may include, but shall not be limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Vibrant commercial activity within cities and towns.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Strong sense of community identity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Adherence to traditional settlement patterns when siting municipal and public buildings and services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Ample alternate transportation modes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Uncongested roads.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Decreased water and air pollution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Clean aquifer recharge areas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Viable wildlife habitat.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Attractive views of the landscape.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Preservation of historic village centers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 9-B:4 Expenditure of State or Federal Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
All state agencies shall give due consideration to the state's policy on smart growth under RSA 9-B:2 when providing advice or expending state or federal funds, for their own use or as pass-through grants, for public works, transportation, or major capital improvement projects, and for the construction, rental, or lease of facilities.  The intent of this action is that new investments and grants for existing sites and buildings in existing community centers will be given preference over investments in outlying areas where that is a practical solution for the use and community in question.
