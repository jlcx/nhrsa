I. A member of the general court may resign his office by delivering a written resignation to the presiding officer of the branch in which the member serves.  When the general court is in session the resignation becomes effective by delivering the letter of resignation to the presiding officer concerned at the state house in Concord, by mail or otherwise.  If the general court is in recess, the resignation becomes effective on the delivery of the letter of resignation to the presiding officer concerned at his place of residence, by mail or otherwise.  The presiding officer who receives a letter of resignation shall send it to the secretary of state for filing.

II. If the general court is not in session, and if the office of the presiding officer is vacant, a resignation from the general court may be made and becomes effective by delivering a letter of resignation to the secretary of state at his office in the state house, by mail or otherwise.  The secretary of state shall file the letter of resignation in his office, and he shall notify the clerk of the branch in which the resignation occurs of the existence of the vacancy.  The secretary of state shall also notify the town or city clerk of the town or ward in which the vacancy occurs.
