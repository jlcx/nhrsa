<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The department shall promote pollution prevention actions in all sectors of the state, including, but not limited, to the department itself, other state agencies, local governmental entities, the regulated communities, and homeowners, as the preferred option for meeting established environmental quality goals.  In any case where pollution prevention options have been explored and found not to be feasible, recycling, treatment, and disposal shall be examined, in that order.  Department decisions which do not contribute to efforts to prevent pollution at the source of generation or release shall be periodically reexamined in order to continually strive toward pollution prevention objectives.
