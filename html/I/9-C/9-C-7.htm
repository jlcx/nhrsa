&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All sales revenues for materials recycled by state agencies shall be forwarded quarterly to the state treasurer for deposit into the state recycling fund established in RSA 9-C:6.  Any revenues derived from collections made by the Tobey School shall be used first to reimburse the school's cost of collecting and handling the materials.  The division may accept gifts, grants, donations or other moneys for deposit into the fund to be used for the same purposes as other moneys in the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Funds accruing to the liquor commission from the sale of corrugated boxes shall be exempt from the provisions of paragraph I.  The liquor commission shall report quarterly to the director of the division on the use of such funds in its recycling program.  Excess funds generated by the recycling program of the liquor commission which are not used by June 30 of each year shall lapse to the fund under RSA 9-C:6.
