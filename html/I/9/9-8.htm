Following his inauguration, the governor shall proceed to the formulation of the budget provided for by RSA 9:2 and 3.  In doing so he shall give such weight to the estimates of income as prepared by the commissioner of administrative services and to the estimates of expenditure requirements as submitted by the departments and to the testimony elicited at the hearings thereon as he deems proper, but the proposals contained in the budget shall represent his judgment and recommendations in respect to the provision to be made for meeting the revenue and expenditure needs of the state for each of the fiscal years of the ensuing biennium.
