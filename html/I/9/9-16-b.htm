&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the governor may, with the prior approval of the fiscal committee, order reductions in any or all expenditure classes within any or all departments, as defined in RSA 9:1, if he determines at any time during the fiscal year that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Projected state revenues will be insufficient to maintain a balanced budget and that the likelihood of a serious deficit exists;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The actual lapse for each fiscal year is not going to equal the level estimated in the forecast of funds, unappropriated surplus, as issued by the legislative budget assistant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The governor shall make available a summary report every 60 days to the presiding officers and to the chairman of the fiscal committee about any actions under this section.
