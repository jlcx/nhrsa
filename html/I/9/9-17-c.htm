&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 9:17-c Employee Benefit Adjustment Account. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whereas the appropriations for employee benefits in state departments and institutions may upon occasion not be totally needed for each position due to vacancies and personnel turnover, the department of administrative services shall transfer said amount quarterly from the departmental or institutional appropriation to a special account to be known as the employee benefit adjustment account.  This fund shall lapse at the end of each fiscal year and revert to the appropriate fund.  Upon the certification of the commissioner of administrative services, subject to the approval of governor and council, the employee benefit account shall be available for transfer to departments and institutions in amounts that are deemed necessary to pay the state's required proportionate share of any legally authorized employee benefit.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 9:17, no transfer shall be made from any appropriation for employee benefits to any other appropriation for any other use or purpose except as provided in this section.
