The governor shall provide criteria for the development of maintenance expenditures which may include the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(2) Salary steps within grade;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) New positions necessary to provide the same level of service;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Additional operating costs associated with previously authorized capital improvement projects to be completed during the biennium;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Reductions for non-recurring costs of the prior fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The maintenance level shall not include new programs or changes in the kind, quantity, or quality of service when the change is at the agency's discretion or is the result of changes in federal or state law or regulation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Within the meaning of this section, the governor shall make the final determination as to whether a particular cost shall be deemed to be a maintenance expenditure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. On or before November 15 prior to each biennial legislative session, all departments of the state shall transmit to the commissioner of administrative services, in a format determined by and on blanks furnished by the commissioner, a reduction level expenditure estimate for each fiscal year of the ensuing biennium for administration, operation, and program services, including costs for workers' compensation and unemployment compensation.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An estimate for a reduced level of expenditure for the first year of the next biennium that is 10 percent, not including debt service, less than the actual expenses of the first year of the current biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An estimate for a reduced level of expenditure for the second year of the next biennium that is 10 percent, not including debt service, less than the budget and any footnote adjustments or subsequent appropriations, additions, or reductions, implemented in the second year of the current biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The 2 reduction level expenditure estimates shall include recommendations for any changes to state statutes and administrative rules required to achieve the reduced level of expenditure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In case of the failure of any department to submit such estimates within the time specified, the commissioner of administrative services shall cause to be prepared such estimates for such department as in the commissioner's opinion are reasonable and proper.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon completion, estimates submitted pursuant to this section shall be publicly available under RSA 91-A.
<br>
