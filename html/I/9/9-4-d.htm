I. On or before October 1 prior to each biennial legislative session, all departments of the state, except the department of transportation, and the judicial branch requesting appropriations from the highway fund shall transmit to the commissioner of administrative services, on blanks to be furnished by the commissioner, appropriate program measures which support the use of highway funds being requested.  This data shall reflect the volume of activity within each accounting unit directly related to highway activity.

II. All departments of the state subject to paragraph I shall develop and implement a cost allocation plan and maintain such records as are necessary to support their expenditures of highway funds.  These records shall include, but not be limited to, revising the integrated system of government cost accounting and financial reporting which accurately and systematically accounts for all expenditures of highway funds within budget and appropriations and from which it shall be possible to obtain accurate annual and interim financial statements and other reports which present fairly and with full disclosure the use of highway funds.
