&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 9:4-b Information Technology Plan. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each executive department, with the necessary assistance of the chief information officer, shall prepare an information technology plan and submit it to the information technology council.  The portion of each plan which addresses the upcoming biennium shall define the capital and operating budgets necessary for implementing the plan.  The budget data in the information technology plan shall provide for both new information technology initiatives and existing operations and shall be consistent with the budget data submitted under RSA 9:4 and 9:4-a.  In the case of the failure of any executive department to submit an information technology plan, the chief information officer shall cause a plan to be prepared as in his or her opinion is reasonable and proper.  Each information technology plan shall identify a process for collaborative involvement of stakeholders representing other levels of government within the state in the development, design, and deployment of information technology systems that involve or impact such other political subdivisions of the state.
