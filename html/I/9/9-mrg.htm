&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 9:4 Requests for Appropriations and Statement of Objectives;  Efficiency Expenditure Requests. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. On or before October 1 prior to each biennial legislative session, all departments of the state shall transmit to the commissioner of administrative services, on forms to be furnished by the commissioner, an efficiency expenditure request for each fiscal year of the following biennium for administration, operation, and program services, including costs for workers' compensation and unemployment compensation.  In case of the failure of any department to submit such requests within the time specified, the commissioner of administrative services shall cause to be prepared such requests for such department as in the commissioner's opinion are reasonable and proper.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In this section, "efficiency expenditure request'' means the cost of providing the services authorized and funded in the preceding biennium, considering and incorporating changes in the population and other factors outside the control of the department, consistent with the objectives in paragraph III.  The governor shall communicate additional parameters, including desired departmental organization chart content and formats, and the total expenditure target for the development of efficiency expenditure requests, on or before August 1 prior to each biennial legislative session.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The primary objective of the efficiency expenditure request is to identify expenditure requests to fund current statutory requirements, and those additional statutes and rules, consistent with parameters and expectations as defined in paragraph IV, that will provide improved quality of services to the citizens of New Hampshire as a result of improved department efficiencies and performance.  Additional objectives of the efficiency expenditure request are to embed a management culture of continuous improvement, prudence, and accountability and to provide the governor and department heads with a fiscal management work product that extends and emphasizes these objectives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The efficiency expenditure request shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An expenditure estimate for the first year of the next biennium.  In accordance with this paragraph, the governor shall provide a total expenditure target for each department which shall be a percentage of the adjusted authorized budget for the second year of the current biennium.  The adjusted authorized budget is the level of funding for the second year of the current operating budget including budget footnote adjustments, executive orders, and adjustments by law including additional appropriations and any changes in laws that affect revenues and expenses outside of the operating budget.  The target shall have as its basis revenue and economic forecasts and the forecasted financial condition of the state for the first year of the next biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An estimate for the second year of the next biennium.  In accordance with this paragraph, the governor shall provide a total expenditure target for each department which is a percentage of the estimate developed for the first year of the next biennium.  The target shall have as its basis revenue and economic forecasts for the second year of the next biennium and the financial condition of the state and shall reflect any changes in law that affect both revenues and expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The current mission statement of the department and its divisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The goals of the department and its divisions for the next biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The impact of salary grade and steps for each authorized and requested position.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The identification of special or problematic needs to be funded or supported, consistent with department goals, which will support improved department efficiencies and deliverables.  The department shall identify the risks or implications associated with not funding or supporting these special or problematic needs.  Such needs are expected to be few and prioritized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Outcome and output performance measures, displaying trends over time, and the data used by the department to create those measures, to evaluate the quality and consequence of services it delivers;  and the identification of performance measures it may develop and implement in the following biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Planned reorganization or restructuring initiatives that promise performance improvement and savings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The identification of information technology or other technology investments, and the linkage for which the net effect is process improvement, improved quality of deliverables, and the resultant cost reduction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The results of innovation initiatives in process improvement and delivery of services executed in the past biennium, if any, and those innovations planned for the following biennium that hold promise of improved efficiencies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Investments in staff training and development consistent with department goals, and with the objectives in paragraph III, that show promise of improved productivity, service, and results within a specific time frame.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Inclusion of additional operating costs associated with previously authorized capital improvement projects to be completed during the biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) The source of funding for all expenditures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Within the meaning of this section, the governor shall make the final determination as to whether a particular cost shall be deemed to be an efficiency expenditure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The efficiency expenditure request shall incorporate recommendations for any necessary changes to state statutes and administrative rules which are barriers to the mission of the department, barriers to the attainment of goals, and barriers to enabling delivery of improved quality of services or services which have not been funded and have a financial burden on the department and/or taxpayers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Subsequent to submission to the commissioner of administrative services, requests and estimates submitted pursuant to this section shall be made publicly available by each department under RSA 91-A.

The general court shall not adopt an operating budget for any fund, or any other legislation which provides for appropriations, which exceed the state's total estimated revenues from existing, increased, or new taxes, fees, operating income and other sources.  If the estimated revenues of the state for the ensuing biennium as set forth in the budget on the basis of existing laws, plus the estimated amounts in the treasury at the close of the year in progress available for expenditure in the ensuing biennial period is less than the aggregate recommended for the ensuing biennial period as contained in the budget, the general court shall adopt a budget in which such deficit shall be met, whether by an increase in the state tax or the imposition of new taxes, increased rates on existing taxes, or otherwise;  and if the aggregate of such estimated revenues, plus estimated balances in the treasury is greater than such recommended appropriations for the ensuing biennial period, the general court shall adopt a budget applying such surplus to the reduction of debt or otherwise, to the reduction in taxation, or to such other action as is in the interest of the public welfare.  Such operating budget shall not use bonded indebtedness to fund operating appropriations.  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the use of projected lapses in determining compliance with this section.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding the definition of "budget'' in RSA 9:1, for purposes of this section the term "budget'' means the operating budget in effect for the appropriate fiscal biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There is hereby established within the general fund general ledger a revenue stabilization reserve account.  At the close of the fiscal biennium ending June 30, 2001, and at the close of each fiscal biennium thereafter, any surplus, as determined by the official audit performed pursuant to RSA 21-I:8, II(a) shall be transferred by the comptroller to a special nonlapsing revenue stabilization reserve account;  provided, however, that in any single fiscal year the total of such transfer shall not exceed  1/2 of the total potential maximum balance allowable under paragraph V. The comptroller is hereby directed to establish the revenue stabilization reserve account in which to deposit any money received from a general fund operating budget surplus.  The state treasurer shall invest funds in this account as authorized by RSA 6:8.  The interest so earned shall be deposited as unrestricted general fund revenue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event of a general fund operating budget deficit at the close of any fiscal biennium as determined by the official audit performed pursuant to RSA 21-I:8, II(a), the comptroller shall notify the fiscal committee of the general court and the governor of such deficit and request that sufficient funds, to the extent available, be transferred from the revenue stabilization reserve account to eliminate such deficit.  Such transfer may be made only when both of the following conditions have been met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A general fund operating budget deficit occurred for the most recently completed fiscal biennium;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unrestricted general fund revenues in the most recently completed fiscal biennium were less than the budget forecast.
<br>
The amount of said transfer shall not exceed a sum equal to the lower of the amount of the deficit in subparagraph (a) or the revenue shortfall in subparagraph (b).  Upon receipt of approval from both the fiscal committee and the governor, the comptroller shall immediately transfer the sums so approved to the general fund surplus account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No available balance in the revenue stabilization reserve account shall be utilized for any purpose other than those authorized by paragraphs II and III, without the specific approval of  2/3 of each house of the general court and the governor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If, after the requirements of paragraphs II-IV have been met and the balance remaining in the revenue stabilization reserve account is in excess of an amount equal to 10 percent of the actual general fund unrestricted revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year, then such excess shall be transferred, without further action, to the general fund surplus account.

No revolving fund shall be authorized by the governor and council except upon written application establishing the necessity for such fund consistent with the efficient operation of the applicant department.  Any revolving fund authorized hereunder for the department of transportation or for the fish and game department shall be established from the highway fund or the fish and game fund, respectively.  The heads of such departments and institutions shall be personally responsible for such moneys while in revolving funds, and shall be authorized to use the same as a petty cash fund only for such departmental purposes as are authorized by law.  No payment from a revolving fund shall bind the state unless and until the specific payment has been pre-audited by the director, division of accounting services and warranted by the governor with the advice and consent of the council.  After such audit and warrant, the treasurer shall be authorized to issue out public funds to restore the authorized balance of the revolving fund concerned.  Department heads responsible for revolving funds shall be bonded in sums sufficient to protect the state against loss of any revolving funds the authorized balances of which exceed $1,000.  All existing revolving funds shall lapse upon the date of the first meeting of the governor and council in 1953, unless renewed at that meeting and revolving funds thereafter authorized hereunder shall similarly lapse on the date of the first meeting of the governor and council in each biennium thereafter, unless then renewed and unless sooner reduced or lapsed by resolution of the governor and council.  Upon such reduction or lapse, the responsible head of the department or institution concerned shall pay the revolving fund moneys into the treasury and the treasurer shall credit the same against the amount standing as a charge to the department or institution concerned.

<codesect>
Whereas the appropriations for employee benefits in state departments and institutions may upon occasion not be totally needed for each position due to vacancies and personnel turnover, the department of administrative services shall transfer said amount quarterly from the departmental or institutional appropriation to a special account to be known as the employee benefit adjustment account.  This fund shall lapse at the end of each fiscal year and revert to the appropriate fund.  Upon the certification of the commissioner of administrative services, subject to the approval of governor and council, the employee benefit account shall be available for transfer to departments and institutions in amounts that are deemed necessary to pay the state's required proportionate share of any legally authorized employee benefit.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 9:17, no transfer shall be made from any appropriation for employee benefits to any other appropriation for any other use or purpose except as provided in this section.
