<codesect>
The governor, with the advice of the council, may, upon petition of a prisoner, grant him a pardon subject to such conditions as the governor considers proper, but a prisoner so pardoned shall, during the unexpired term of his sentence, violate no law, and he shall be in the custody of the state parole officer.  The governor may issue his warrant to all proper officers to carry such pardon into effect and such warrant shall be obeyed and executed instead of the sentence originally imposed.
