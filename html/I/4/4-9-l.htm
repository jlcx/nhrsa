I. A commission is established to oversee the location, design, construction, and maintenance of a John G. Winant memorial and to privately raise and expend all the funds necessary for its construction and maintenance.  The governor is authorized to accept for the commission, in the name of the state, the gifts of money, which are donated to construct and maintain the memorial.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission may accept donated in-kind services, goods, and materials for the construction and maintenance of the memorial without governor and council approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The gifts of money, which are donated to contract, construct, and maintain the memorial, shall be placed in a special nonlapsing account in the state treasury, to be expended for the purposes of the John G. Winant memorial.  Any money remaining in the special account after construction of the memorial is completed shall be used for the care, maintenance, repair, and additions to the memorial, or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the commission.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission may expend the money raised or accepted as a gift without the approval of governor and council, to contract for the construction and perpetual maintenance of the memorial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission shall remain in existence upon the completion of the John G. Winant memorial for the purpose of overseeing maintenance and approving any change to the memorial.  Any site change for the memorial shall be made under the supervision of the director of operations of the department of transportation.
