<codesect>
The governor and council may expend a sum not to exceed $5,000 in any calendar year for the purpose of purchasing from the estates of deceased surveyors and civil engineers such field notes, maps, and other records prepared by them as will be of value in preserving real estate records of the state, and may direct the highway commissioner or other engineers to examine such records as are for sale for the purpose of ascertaining their value to the public.  The governor is authorized to draw his warrant for the payment of the same out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.
