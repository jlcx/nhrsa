<center><h3>Section 4:30-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 4:30-a Acquisition of Municipal Land Used for Conservation or Recreation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the state proposes to acquire any municipal land, under the provisions of RSA 4:29, 4:30, 233, 236, or of any other applicable section of RSA, for highway or other purposes, and such land had been used by said municipality for conservation or recreation, it shall first comply with the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A public hearing shall be held which may be a special hearing or the hearing required by RSA 4:33, 233:10, 236, or by any other applicable section of RSA.  At such public hearing and in any statutorily required notice thereof, and in a notice which shall be posted 90 days prior to the hearing, the state shall set forth the description of the land proposed to be acquired and the proposed use of such land, together with any reasons justifying the acquisition of such property rather than other land.  The state may acquire such land, for highway or other purposes, unless, at any meeting called prior to said hearing to act on the question, the governing body of the municipality in which the land is located, by a majority of its members present and voting, votes to disapprove the proposed acquisition.  Any approval or disapproval of such proposed acquisition which has been duly voted by the governing body of the municipality shall be certified to the appropriate state official or agency by the municipal officials at the public hearing or within 15 days thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event that the governing body votes to disapprove the proposed acquisition, the state may acquire such land only by filing a petition in the superior court for any order permitting it to do so.  At the time the petition is filed, the state shall serve a copy thereof upon the municipality.  After hearing any interested citizens and considering all the facts and the public policy of this state which encourages the use of land for recreation and conservation purposes, if said court finds that no other land is available as a satisfactory substitute for the land proposed to be taken, it shall issue an appropriate order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When the state acquires any municipal land under the provisions of this section, it shall transfer to said municipality other comparable land and facilities to the extent feasible, or shall grant to said municipality sufficient funds to acquire comparable land and facilities for such purposes.  The fact that the land and facilities are comparable within the meaning of this paragraph shall be determined by the order of the court or by the state agency acquiring the land, subject to any applicable statutory right of appeal therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In order to transfer comparable land and facilities as provided in this section, the state, or the appropriate agency thereof, may by purchase or condemnation acquire such land and facilities.  When title to the replaced land was vested in more than one municipality, title to the replacement land shall be vested in units to each of such municipalities in the same proportion as that in which the replaced land was held.

The following shall constitute sufficient evidence of vested rights:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The activities are specifically identified in a building permit application that has been approved by the appropriate municipal board or official with authority over building permits prior to January 1, 2011;  or
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition to paragraph I, portions of real estate owned by the state and managed by a state agency that are on the shores of public waters as defined by RSA 271:20, may be leased by persons who can demonstrate the intent to provide a public use or benefit by utilizing the state land, provided the proposed lease is reviewed in accordance with all relevant procedures related to the disposal of state-owned property and provided the lease is compliant with all statutory requirements for the use of the land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Leases shall be for a period of not more than 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Leases may be renewed after the initial lease period has expired, provided that the use of the leased property remains noncommercial and private, payments have been made by the lessee according to the lease, all statutory conditions are met, and the lessee is compliant with all state and federal permit requirements.  Such lease renewals shall not be for more than 5 years at a time, unless extended by authorization of the long range capital planning and utilization committee and the governor and council.  This paragraph shall apply to all lease renewals regardless of their date of origin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 4:45 State of Emergency Declaration;  Powers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governor shall have the power to declare a state of emergency, as defined in RSA 21-P:35, VIII, by executive order if the governor finds that a natural, technological, or man-made disaster of major proportions is imminent or has occurred within this state, and that the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this state require an invocation of the provisions of this section.  The general court shall have the same power to declare a state of emergency by concurrent resolution of the house and senate.  An executive order or concurrent resolution declaring a state of emergency shall specify the:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Nature of the emergency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Political subdivisions or geographic areas subject to the declaration;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Conditions that have brought about the emergency;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Duration of the state of emergency, if less than 21 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A state of emergency shall terminate automatically 21 days after its declaration unless it is renewed under the same procedures set forth in paragraph I of this section.  The governor may, by executive order, renew a declaration of a state of emergency as many times as the governor finds is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the governor finds that maintaining the state of emergency is no longer justified, the governor shall issue an executive order terminating the state of emergency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The legislature may terminate a state of emergency by concurrent resolution adopted by a majority vote of each chamber.  The governor's power to renew a declaration of a state of emergency shall terminate upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution under this subparagraph;  provided, however, that such resolution shall not preclude the governor from declaring a new emergency for different circumstances under paragraph I of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. During the existence of a state of emergency, and only for so long as such state of emergency shall exist, the governor shall have and may exercise the following additional emergency powers:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To enforce all laws, rules, and regulations relating to emergency management and to assume control of any or all emergency management forces and helpers in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To sell, lend, lease, give, transfer, receive, or deliver materials or perform services for emergency management purposes on such terms and conditions as the governor shall prescribe and without regard to the limitations of any existing law, and to account to the state treasurer for any funds received for such property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To provide for and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area or areas within the state and to take such steps as are necessary for the receipt and care of such evacuees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Subject to the provisions of the state constitution, to remove from office any public officer having administrative responsibilities under RSA 21-P:34 through 21-P:48.  Such removal shall be upon charges after service upon such person of a copy of such charges and after giving him or her an opportunity to be heard in his or her defense.  Pending the preparation and disposition of charges, the governor may suspend such person for a period not exceeding 30 days.  A vacancy resulting from removal or suspension pursuant to this section shall be filled by the governor until it is filled as otherwise provided by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) To perform and exercise such other functions, powers, and duties as are necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) To declare an emergency temporary location or locations for the seat of state government at such place or places within this state as the governor may deem advisable under the circumstances and to take such action and issue such orders as may be necessary for an orderly transaction of the affairs of state government to such emergency temporary location or locations.  Such emergency temporary location or locations shall remain the seat of government until the legislature shall by law establish a new location or locations or until the state of emergency is declared to be ended by the governor and the seat of government is returned to its normal location.

I. Whenever a state of emergency is declared or invoked and the taking of real or personal property is required, the governor with the advice and consent of the executive council may, by warrant specifying the particular real property and the personal property by specification of the types, quantities, and general location, together with the names of the owners, when known, authorize the commissioner of safety, by his or her agents, to:
<br>

Upon taking possession or control of such property the person shall present a receipt specifically listing the property so taken and specifically referring to the warrant authorizing the taking.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever possession of any real estate or title to any personal property is taken under this section, its owner or possessor, hereinafter referred to as the claimant, shall be entitled to damages on account of such taking.  Upon the taking of any such property, the chief justice of the superior court is authorized to appoint a commission of 3 suitable persons to assess fair and just compensation in cases in which the amount cannot be determined by agreement.  The chief justice shall fix the per diem compensation of the members of the commission and fill any vacancies which may occur.  The commission shall determine what sum shall justly compensate the claimant for the property so taken and may in the performance of its duties hire, and the state shall pay for the services of, such skilled and disinterested appraisers as the commission shall deem necessary to assist it in the performance of its duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any claimant aggrieved by the award made by the commission may appeal to the superior court from the decision within 60 days from the granting of the award.  All final awards of judgments entered against the state in such proceedings and the fees and expenses of the commission shall be promptly paid by the state treasurer, on warrant of the governor and council, from any money in the general fund of the treasury not otherwise appropriated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The property taken under this section shall be used in such manner as the governor, with the advice and consent of the executive council, shall deem in the best interests of the state, its inhabitants or the United States, which manner may include the sale at the prevailing market price or the gratuitous distribution of the articles enumerated in subparagraphs I(c)(3), (4) and (5).  All moneys derived from the sale of any such property shall be paid over to the state treasurer and deposited in the general fund of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any person who willfully takes possession of, or attempts to take possession of, property, purporting to act under this section but without authority to so act, whether by false pretense or otherwise, upon conviction, shall be guilty of a class B felony if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person, and  1/2 of any fine imposed shall be paid to the owner of the property and  1/2 to the county.
