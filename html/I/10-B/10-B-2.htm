&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director of plant and property management, department of administrative services, or any other state agency authorized to build, acquire, or lease building space, shall require that the following facilities meet clean air standards before they may be used as office space:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) After January 1, 1989, any new state building, any existing building acquired by the state, any building space leased by the state for the first time, or any building bequeathed to the state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) After January 1, 1996, any building space leased by the state either in an original or renewal lease;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) After January 1, 2000, any building addition or building renovation to a state building.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of health and human services, shall be responsible for certification in writing to the director of plant and property management or other appropriate state agency head that the buildings listed under paragraph I meet the clean air standards.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the department may establish testing requirements for building space previously certified under this chapter which are less stringent than testing for building space not previously certified.  Similar less stringent testing requirements may also be established for very small or short-term leases or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the state enters into a lease for any building listed under paragraph I which does not meet the clean air standards, the state may terminate such lease.
