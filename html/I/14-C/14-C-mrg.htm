&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 14-C:1 Purpose.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that persons charged with carrying out the duties and activities of the legislative branch of state government do so in an atmosphere that supports the independent judgment of such persons and minimizes the opportunity for inappropriate influence by persons or organizations subject to or likely to become subject to or interested in any matter or action pending in the legislative branch.  To that end, this chapter defines gifts that may not be given to, solicited by, or accepted by persons subject to the provisions of the chapter and establishes requirements for the reporting of honorariums, expense reimbursements, and certain other receipts.  This chapter shall be liberally construed to effect this purpose.
