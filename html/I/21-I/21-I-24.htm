II. If the injured claimant was employed in a department or agency which has received a legislative appropriation for this purpose, the commissioner of administrative services shall charge said sum or sums to the legislative appropriation.  In the event there are not sufficient funds appropriated to the commissioner of administrative services to make payments hereunder, the governor upon request of the commissioner of administrative services is authorized to draw his warrant for such sums from any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated;  provided that payments made to employees paid from the highway fund shall be a charge upon said highway fund, that payments made to employees paid from the fish and game fund shall be a charge upon said fish and game fund, that payments made to employees paid from special funds shall be a charge upon said special funds, and that payments made to employees paid from other funds shall be a charge upon the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If federal regulations prohibit the direct assessment of payments made pursuant to RSA 21-I:24, I from otherwise applicable federal funds, said payments shall be a charge against the general fund in the first instance, but the commissioner of administrative services shall seek recovery of these payments in such amount and under such conditions as the federal regulations applicable to each affected agency may prescribe.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If managed care program expenses, or other expenses directly related to the provision and monitoring of workers' compensation benefits payable to state employees, are procured by the payment of a group insurance premium or other risk shifting method, the commissioner of administrative services shall charge state agencies the cost of such general expenses in proportion to the number of agency employees who receive the services in question in the manner provided by RSA 21-I:24, II.
