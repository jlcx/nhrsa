&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director of procurement and support services may, upon written application of an agency, authorize the agency, or one or more individuals designated by the agency, to purchase commodities or services secured by or through the division using procurement cards issued for that purpose;  provided, however, that no such card shall be used for an expenditure which is greater than the amount allowed by the division for purchases under the applicable contract, or the price allowed by the division for the commodity or service, and provided further that use of such cards shall be in accordance with paragraphs II and III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Use of a procurement card under paragraph I shall not alter any other purchasing requirements which may apply to the agency or to the type of purchase at issue, including but not limited to any restrictions or limitations contained in contracts entered into by the division of procurement and support services and any processes, rules, or manual of procedures provisions adopted by the department of administrative services which are applicable to the purchase.  Agencies' use of procurement cards shall be subject to the limitations of the amounts appropriated by the legislature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The form and use of credit cards to conduct or pay for purchases under paragraph I shall be prescribed by rules adopted by the commissioner of administrative services pursuant to RSA 541-A in consultation with the state treasurer, or in the department's manual of procedures described in RSA 21-1:14, I.  Rules or procedures adopted by the commissioner shall include processes for monitoring the use of cards.  Cards shall be used only for state purposes.  Unauthorized use of a card may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.  Any person who knowingly uses a card in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
