&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-I:43-a Compensation for State Employees Injured in Line of Duty. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any injury received by any state employee who is injured in the line of duty by a hostile act, or by an act caused by another during the performance of duties which are considered dangerous in nature, that requires the employee to be hospitalized or renders the employee temporarily unable to perform the duties of his or her position shall not be charged against annual leave or sick leave for the time lost due to the injury.  During such time, the employee shall remain on the active payroll.  In this event, no employee shall be terminated from state service until he or she has applied for disability retirement and a final decision on the application is made by the board of trustees of the New Hampshire retirement system and appeals of such decision, if any, are finalized;  provided, that the employee shall make such application within 18 months of the injury contemplated by this section.  The executive head of the employee's agency shall make the determination as to whether an injury is in the line of duty and due to a hostile or overt act, or an act caused by another during the performance of duties which are considered dangerous in nature, and, after approval by the governor and council, the determination shall be final.  During the time in which the injured employee remains on active payroll at full base salary pursuant to this section, his or her state compensation shall not be offset by state workers' compensation payments and he or she shall not receive state workers' compensation payments to supplement his or her full base salary.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit medical payments or final settlements.
