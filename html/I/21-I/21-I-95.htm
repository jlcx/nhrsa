I. Upon a determination by the commissioner of administrative services of the feasibility of a state credit card affinity program which meets the requirements of this subdivision and the minimum enrollment required of financial services companies administering a credit card affinity program, the commissioner shall have the authority to enter into an agreement with a credit card issuer for the issuance of a co-branded or affinity credit card.  The credit card issuer and terms of the co-branded card most favorable to the purpose described in paragraph II shall be selected following a request for proposals and awarded through competitive bidding.
