&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-I:75 Agency Indirect Cost Recovery Plan. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An agency that receives outside funding from any source shall prepare and submit to the commissioner for review and approval an indirect cost recovery plan.  The plan shall include proposals to recover agency indirect costs, the portion of statewide central service costs (statewide indirect costs) allocated to the agency under the statewide central services cost allocation plan, and any computation of indirect costs under RSA 124:11.  By October 1 of each year, and prior to submission to the approving federal agency, if any, the agency shall submit the completed indirect cost rate proposal and supporting documentation to the commissioner for review and approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I, the commissioner may waive the requirement that the agency file an indirect cost recovery plan if the commissioner determines that the cost of preparing and submitting the plan exceeds the benefit to the state of receiving such a plan.
