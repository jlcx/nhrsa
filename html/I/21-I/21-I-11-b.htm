I. The purpose of this section is to promote procurement practices and procedures which the general court believes will improve the state's procurement process while at the same time establishing a vendor selection procedure which, among other things, is specifically geared toward reducing unemployment and stimulating economic growth in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To promote business in this state, when qualified lowest bids, proposals, or quotations are received by the division of procurement and support services at the same price, the division's selection or recommendation for selection shall, if the process is not cancelled by the state, be made by drawing lots, provided, however, that if only one of the vendors offering that price has a principal place of business in New Hampshire, that vendor shall, if the process is not cancelled by the state, be selected or recommended for selection.  When qualified lowest bids, proposals, or quotations are received at the same price from more than one vendor which has a principal place of business in New Hampshire, selection or recommendation for selection shall, if the process is not cancelled by the state, be made by drawing lots from among the vendors with a principal place of business in New Hampshire.
