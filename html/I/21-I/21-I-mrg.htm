Prior to posting the name of an individual or entity on the public website, the division shall, by way of certified or registered mail to the last known address of the individual or entity, notify the vendor of its intention to post.  This requirement of notification shall not apply in the case of potential vendors whose names are posted by the division because those vendors' names appear on a federal or state debarred parties list.  The individual or entity to whom a notification has been forwarded may request a hearing by certified or registered mail received by the division within 30 days of the date of the letter of notification.  The division may post the vendor's name on its website if no request for a hearing is received in that period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The director of the division of procurement and support services may preclude an individual who has been forwarded a notification under paragraph II from bidding or submitting a response to a request for quotation or proposal to the division whenever he or she concludes that to do so is necessary to protect the public interest.  If such immediate debarment is ordered, the director shall notify the individual or entity in the notification forwarded under paragraph II.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name of the individual or entity whose name is proposed for posting;
<br>

(b) The reason for the division's decision;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The actual calendar date by which any request for a hearing must be received by the division;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Individuals or entities placed on the debarred parties list shall generally be debarred from making bids, quotations, or proposals to the division for as long as they are disqualified under paragraph I or for a period of one year after placement on the list by the division, whichever is longer.  The director of the division of procurement and support services may earlier terminate the debarment if he or she determines that the reason for debarment no longer exists, or that the debarred vendor has successfully completed the terms of a sentence or penalty, including probation responsibilities, and that earlier termination will not, in the opinion of the director, adversely affect the public interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Debarment shall in no way affect the obligation of a vendor to provide products or services already under contract.  In its discretion, however, the state may deem the submission of a bid, proposal, or quotation contrary to paragraph I a breach of contract.

<codesect>
In this subdivision:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Energy cost saving measure'' means any construction, improvement, repair, alteration, or betterment of any building or facility or any equipment, fixture, or furnishing to be added to or used in any building or facility that will be a cost effective energy-related project.  This shall include any project that will lower energy or utility costs in connection with the operation or maintenance of such building or facility and will achieve energy cost savings sufficient to recover any project costs or incurred debt service within 20 years from the date of project implementation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Energy performance contract'' means an agreement for the provision of energy services or equipment or both.  This shall include, but shall not be limited to, energy conservation-enhancing projects in buildings and alternate energy technologies, in which a private sector person or company agrees to finance, design, construct, install, maintain, operate, or manage energy systems or equipment to improve the energy efficiency of, or produce energy in connection with, a state government agency or facility in exchange for a portion of the energy cost savings or specified revenues.  The level of payments made would be contingent upon measured energy cost savings or energy production.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Positive cash flow financing'' means an agreement among an agency, a capital leasing firm, and a provider of design/build energy management services under which the leasing cost of the project, including all interest payments, is equal to or less than the energy cost the project avoids.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Shared-savings contract'' means an agreement under which a private sector person or company undertakes to design, implement, install, operate, and maintain improvements to the agency's or municipality's procedures, equipment or facilities, and the agency or municipality agrees to pay a contractually specified amount of measured or estimated energy cost savings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Date of project implementation'' means the expected date established in the energy performance contract that the construction, improvement, repair, alteration, or betterment is to be completed and become operational.  If the energy performance contract includes more than one energy cost saving measure, the "date of project implementation'' may be alternatively defined by the contracting state agency or municipality to be the date that the last of the energy cost saving measures is expected to become operational.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Demand response program'' means a program under which the state receives payment for voluntarily reducing electricity demand in response to grid instability as dictated by the regional independent system operator or in response to high wholesale electricity prices.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon the approval by the IEEC and governor and council, the agency may enter into an energy performance contract with the person or company whose proposal is selected as the most qualified based on the criteria established by the agency.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any contract entered into shall contain the following annual allocation dependency clause:  "The continuation of this contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds to fulfill the requirements of the contract by the applicable funding authority.  If that authority fails to appropriate sufficient funds to provide for the continuation of the contract, the contract shall terminate on the last day of the fiscal year for which allocations were made.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any energy performance contract should require the contractor to include all energy efficiency improvement in selected buildings that are calculated to recover all costs within 20 years from the date of project implementation at existing energy prices.  The contract shall require that the public utility or energy services provider be repaid only to the extent of energy cost savings guaranteed by the contractor to accrue over the term of the contract.  Repayments to the public utility or energy services provider shall be interest-free.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-I:19-g Use of State-Owned Vehicles. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of administrative services shall determine for each 2-year budget cycle the minimum number of miles required to justify retaining a state-owned vehicle referred to as the break-even mileage.  The break-even miles shall take into account operational costs, depreciation, and mileage reimbursement rates for use of personal vehicles as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Break-even mileage shall be calculated by summing average fixed and annual operating costs then dividing by the Internal Revenue Service reimbursement rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fixed costs shall include the average purchase price minus the average resale price divided by the average useful life of the vehicle.  Average annual operating costs shall include:  oil changes, repairs, tires, gasoline, insurance, and other miscellaneous costs, if any.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of administrative services shall make this determination by September 1 of the first year of each biennium.  The break-even mileage shall only apply to vehicles in service by an agency for an entire fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If state-owned passenger vehicles are assigned to a state agency and such vehicles are not used for travel at or above the break-even mileage requirement during such year, the director of procurement and support services shall declare them surplus and transfer or otherwise dispose of such vehicle or vehicles.  An agency may within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year apply to the fiscal committee of the general court to retain such vehicle or vehicles.  If such agency presents a clear and convincing case for the continued assignment of a vehicle or vehicles to the agency, the fiscal committee may permit the agency to retain a vehicle or vehicles.  In granting an agency the authority to retain such vehicle or vehicles, favorable consideration shall be given to the most fuel efficient use of the existing fleet.  The director of procurement and support services shall either sell the vehicle or vehicles declared to be surplus, transfer them to a centralized state vehicle pool, or transfer them to any state agency having employees who travel more than the break-even mileage requirement as set by the department of administrative services and who are being reimbursed for travel in privately-owned vehicles.  The term "agency'' as used in this section includes a department, institution, board, division, and commission.  The director of procurement and support services may develop measures to determine or improve fleet efficiency in addition to those set forth in this section.  Such measures may be shared with the fiscal committee for their information and consideration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Light duty truck'' shall mean any of the following which have a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 10,000 pounds:  a passenger van seating up to 8 people, a pick-up truck, a sport utility vehicle, or a cargo van.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Passenger vehicle'' shall mean a passenger sedan or station wagon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-b. The department of administrative services shall annually report to the fiscal committee of the general court all light duty trucks whose mileage is at or below the break-even mileage requirement during such year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All permanently assigned passenger vehicles shall be approved by the governor and council by September 30, 2009 or such vehicles shall be declared surplus and the director of plant and property management shall transfer the vehicle or vehicles to a centralized state vehicle pool.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The provisions of paragraph IV shall not apply to law enforcement vehicles with the exception of those vehicles assigned to staff personnel or to any vehicles acquired with 100 percent federal funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. State employees shall accurately report to their agency payroll personnel all personal use of any state-owned motor vehicle of any type, including but not limited to any commuting miles.  The agency shall annually report all personal use of state-owned vehicles in that agency, as well as such other information regarding vehicles and vehicle usage, to the department of administrative services as directed by the department.

This section shall not apply to vehicles used for the purposes of law enforcement.  This section shall be interpreted so as not to conflict with federal Internal Revenue statutes or regulations and shall not relieve an agency or its employees from non-wage fringe benefit reporting requirements for nonbusiness use of state-owned motor vehicles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. By August 1, 2011, each agency shall review the utilization of all vehicles which are assigned to the agency to determine if nonbusiness use for any vehicle exceeds 15 percent of the total miles traveled by that vehicle for the preceding fiscal year.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For each vehicle reported under paragraph III, the director of the division of procurement and support services of the department of administrative services either shall declare the vehicle surplus and transfer or otherwise dispose of the vehicle or shall reassign the vehicle within the agency, unless a waiver of the requirements of this paragraph is granted by the vehicle utilization committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Requests for waivers from the vehicle utilization committee shall be submitted to the commissioner at the same time as the report required by paragraph III.  The vehicle utilization committee shall grant a waiver if it concludes that to do so would be in the best interests of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. There is hereby established a vehicle utilization committee consisting of the following officials or designees:

VIII. After October 1, 2011, the vehicle utilization committee may, at any time, with the prior approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, adjust the percentage of nonbusiness use miles traveled by a vehicle during the preceding fiscal year which may result in a vehicle being declared surplus and subject to transfer or other disposal by the director of the division of procurement and support services.  In the absence of any adjustment, the percentage shall be 15 percent.  Any adjustment of the percentage made by the vehicle utilization committee shall be communicated to agencies by the vehicle utilization committee and shall remain in effect until further adjustment, if any, is made.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In the course of conducting the assessment described in paragraph IV, the department of administrative services shall consult with a representative of the agency concerning the effective and efficient achievement of the agency's purposes, objectives, and functions.

<center><h2>Certain State Contracts</h2></center>

<center><h3>Section 21-I:20</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-I:20 State Contracts;  Withholding Percentage of Money Due. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Under any contract made or awarded by a state agency which exceeds a total of $500,000 and on which a state agency withholds a percentage of the money due the contractor until the state agency has accepted the contract, the contractor may withdraw the whole or a portion of the amount retained under the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A negotiable certificate of deposit, United States treasury notes, United States treasury certificates of indebtedness, United States treasury bills, or bonds or notes of the state of New Hampshire or of any political subdivision of the state of New Hampshire in an amount equivalent to the amount to be withdrawn shall be first deposited with the treasurer of the state of New Hampshire.  The initial amount deposited shall be at least $10,000.  No amount shall be withdrawn in excess of the market value of the securities at the time of deposit or the par value of such securities, whichever is lower.  The minimum value of any individual security shall be $5,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. With prior notification to the contracting agency of the state and the state treasurer, the contractor shall be allowed to substitute securities for those deposited under paragraph I;  provided that the market value of the new securities at the time of substitution or the par value of such securities, whichever is lower, shall be equal to or exceed the amount withheld by the state agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state treasurer shall collect all interest or income when due on the obligations so deposited and shall pay the same, when and as collected, to the contractor who deposited the obligations.  If the deposit is in the form of coupon bonds, the state treasurer shall deliver each coupon as it matures to the contractor.  The state treasurer shall have the power to enter into a contract or agreement with any national bank, trust company or safe deposit company located in New England for custodial care and servicing of any securities deposited with him under this section.  Such services shall consist of the safekeeping of the securities and of all services required to effect the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any amount deducted by a state agency, pursuant to the terms of the contract, from the retained payments due the contractor shall be deducted, first from that portion of the retained payments for which no security has been substituted, then from the proceeds of any deposited security.  In the latter case, the contractor shall be entitled to receive interest, coupons, or income only from those securities which remain after such amount has been deducted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any assignment of retained payments made by the contractor shall be honored by the state treasurer as part of the procedure to accomplish the substitution of securities under this section, provided that the assignment shall not be made without prior approval by the contracting state agency and the state treasurer.  The assignment shall not impair the equitable rights of the contractor's surety in the retained payments, in the securities substituted for retained payments in the event of the contractor's default in the performance of the contract, or in the payment of labor and material bills or other obligations covered by the surety's bond.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-I:22 Selection of Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As used in this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Agency'' means any executive department, commission, board, institution, bureau, office, or other agency of state government, by whatever name called, that uses, disburses, expends, or receives any state funds, but excluding the university system of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Engineering, architectural, and surveying services'' includes those professional services of an engineering, architectural or surveying nature, as well as incidental services that members of these professions and those in their employ may logically and justifiably perform.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Members of these professions'' means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity permitted by law to practice in this state the professions of engineering, architecture, or surveying.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court hereby declares that it shall be the policy of the state and its agencies to negotiate contracts for engineering, architectural, and surveying services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services required, and at fair and reasonable prices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All state agencies, when seeking professional services, shall publish a request for proposals or, when a definite scope of work is not yet defined, a request for qualifications for each project for which engineering, architectural, or surveying services are to be procured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Each agency engaging these professional services shall prepare a description of its procedures for procurement of architectural, engineering or surveying services.  These descriptions shall be distributed to interested professionals subject to the provisions of this section.  The agency, for each proposed project, shall publish a request for qualifications (RFQ) or request for proposals (RFP) and shall review and consider the qualifications after receiving qualifications or proposals.  The agency shall then establish a short list of not less than 3 firms.  The agency shall, for purposes of negotiation, arrange the firms deemed to be best qualified in order of preference as determined in accordance with the prescribed procedures of the agency.  An interview may be held with the short list firms or, in the case of selection based on an RFQ and where the scope of work has been further defined, detailed technical proposals may be requested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The agency shall negotiate a contract with the highest qualified firm for architectural, engineering, or surveying services at compensation which the agency determines is fair and reasonable to the state.  In making such determination, the agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, and professional nature of the services to be rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Should the agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified, at a price determined to be fair and reasonable to the state, negotiations with that firm should be formally terminated.  The agency should then undertake negotiations with the second most qualified firm.  Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the agency should terminate negotiations.  The agency should then undertake negotiations with the third most qualified firm.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Should the agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the agency shall select additional firms in order of their competence and qualification and continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Once negotiations have been completed and the agency has had its contract approved by the governor and council, all proposals submitted for a project shall become available for public review.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each state project whose estimated cost is more than $25,000 shall be built under contracts awarded to the lowest qualified bidder who meets all project specifications through competitive bidding.  The following are excluded from this competitive bidding requirement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Projects executed under RSA 481 with approval of the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Projects for the department of fish and game, the adjutant general's department, and the department of resources and economic development whose estimated total cost is not more than $250,000.  Such projects may be done on a force account basis, by contracts awarded through competitive bidding, by short term rental of construction equipment, or by any combination of these methods.  These departments are authorized to rent construction equipment for periods not exceeding 6 months at rates the departments deem competitive through the use of quotes or bids.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In an emergency, projects may be done on a force account basis upon the recommendation of the commissioner, with the approval of the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner is authorized to use the design build and construction management methods of contracting for any project.  The capital budget overview committee shall approve preliminary plans prior to construction, reconstruction, alteration, or maintenance if the project is part of a capital project and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The construction management method of contracting is used;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The design build method of contracting is used and the estimated cost is more than $500,000.  If the design-build method of contracting is used and the estimated cost is $500,000 or less, preapproval of the capital budget overview committee shall not be required, but the department shall notify the committee of all such projects and shall provide quarterly reports on project status.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any state project whose estimated cost is more than $500,000 shall be designed by a registered architect or professional engineer unless, upon recommendation of the commissioner, the governor and council shall find that it is in the best interests of the state to provide for in-house design.  He or she shall prepare plans and specifications which meet the requirements of all applicable codes and shall provide on-site observation and inspection services.  Each registered architect or professional engineer shall carry professional liability insurance in an amount satisfactory to the commissioner consistent with industry standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. After written application to the capital budget overview committee, the requirements of paragraph II may be waived upon approval of the capital budget overview committee and the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. State capital budget projects shall not be awarded through cost-plus contracts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any repair project authorized in the capital budget which requires consultant services shall be put into effect within 90 days after the adoption of the capital budget.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A certificate of insurance of his or her current workers' compensation coverage in New Hampshire for the classification of work to be completed on the project;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A sworn statement that this coverage shall remain in effect for the duration of his or her anticipated work on the project;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A completed work certificate, provided pursuant to RSA 281-A:4-b, that shall include the total number of employees anticipated to be employed by such contractor, subcontractor, or independent contractor on the project during the contract period, delineated by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) classification code applicable to the scope of work to be performed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A copy of the contractor's compliance with a current written safety program, if applicable, as filed with the commissioner of labor under RSA 281-A:64, II and proof of an existing joint loss management committee as required under RSA 281-A:64, III, if applicable;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The department may develop procedures to obtain the requirements in this section on an annual basis or by a prequalification procedure rather than on a project-by-project basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If any construction contractor, subcontractor, or independent contractor who might otherwise claim an exclusion under RSA 281-A:18-a is directly performing the work on a project covered under this section, such contractor, subcontractor, or independent contractor shall comply with the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner of labor may assess any contractor, subcontractor, or independent contractor who falsifies information or fails to comply with this section a civil penalty of up to $2,500 and in addition, such an employer shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $100 per employee per day of noncompliance.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any person with control or responsibility over the decisions to disburse funds and salaries and who knowingly falsified information or knowingly failed to comply with this section shall be held personally liable for the payment of penalties under this section and such contractor, subcontractor, or independent contractor shall not be allowed to bid or work on state projects for up to 5 years.  The state shall be entitled to recover from the violator all costs and fees directly associated with uncovering falsified information supplied under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) All funds collected under this paragraph shall be deposited into the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner of labor shall appoint as many individuals as necessary to carry out the department's responsibilities under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) On a quarterly basis, the commissioners of administrative services and labor shall post electronically for public access and shall also circulate to all other public works construction or renovation awarding authorities of state government, including the college and university systems and the department of education office of building aid, a list of any construction contractors, subcontractors, or independent contractors found to be in violation of this section, including the amount fined and the period of time such persons or entities shall not be allowed to bid or work on state projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-I:81 Competitive Bidding. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No project subject to the competitive bidding requirements of RSA 21-I:80 shall be awarded to any independent contractor except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the commissioner decides that the bid of the lowest bidder should be accepted, he or she shall prepare a contract of acceptance of the lowest bid within 60 days from the opening of bids.  He or she shall execute the contract in the name of the state.  After the contract is executed by the lowest bidder, the form of it approved by the attorney general, and the availability of funds approved by the commissioner of administrative services, he or she shall transmit the contract to the governor and council.  Upon approval by the governor and council, it shall become a valid contract of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state reserves the right to reject any and all bids or to negotiate with the lowest qualified bidder who meets all project specifications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the commissioner decides that for just cause shown the lowest bid submitted should be rejected, he or she shall promptly transmit to the governor and council the recommendation for rejection including reasons.  The governor and council shall review the recommendation and any other facts available to them, and make such determination as in their judgment shall be for the best interest of the state.  They shall require a public hearing upon request of any bidder or on their own motion to fully establish such facts.  Their determination shall be entered upon the records of the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If not more than one bid is received on any state project advertised for contract construction, the commissioner may negotiate a contract for such construction upon terms which he or she may deem most advantageous to the state, subject to the approval of the governor and council.  For projects built with federal aid, if any provision of this section is inconsistent with the requirements of applicable federal law and regulations, the latter shall control.
