(1) Purchasing all materials, equipment, supplies, and services for all departments and agencies of the state including contracting for the purchase or rental of data processing equipment and contracting for the purchase of electric power supply and services, except as otherwise provided by law.  Insofar as practicable all such purchases shall be made in such quantities and manner as shall be most economical for the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Requiring competitive bidding before making any purchase for the state pursuant to the laws of the state applicable to the division's procurement functions, except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) When the best interests of the state would be served thereby and the purchase involves a total expenditure of not more than $10,000 or is a purchase in an approved class.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) When after reasonable investigation, it appears that any required unit or item of supply, or brand of such unit or item, is procurable by the state from only one source.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) When, after reasonable investigation, it appears that any required service, unit or item of supply, or brand of such unit or item, has a fixed market price at all sources available to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) When, in the opinion of the governor, an emergency exists of a nature which requires the immediate procurement of supplies, he or she may authorize the director of procurement and support services to make a purchase without competitive bidding;  and where the rates filed with and approved by the insurance commissioner are uniform, the purchase of state insurance and public state official and employee bonds are specifically excluded from competitive bidding as to price;  provided, however, that nothing contained in this subparagraph shall preclude the director of procurement and support services from inviting plans of insurance coverage from any resident licensed insurance agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Except where competitive bidding has been employed, no purchase involving an expenditure of more than $10,000 or purchase in an approved class may be made by the director of procurement and support services without the written approval of the commissioner.  In requesting such approval, the director shall first state in writing his or her reasons for not employing competitive bidding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Be maintained by the treasurer as a separate, restricted fund.
