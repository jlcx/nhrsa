&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director of procurement and support services may, upon written application of the governing board of any agency, authorize such governing board, or one or more individuals designated by such board, to purchase supplies for the agency directly from vendors by the use of field purchase orders, or by the use of procurement cards issued for that purpose;  provided, however, that no such field purchase order or procurement card shall be used where a total expenditure of more than $1,000 is involved unless such use is otherwise allowed by law.  The form and use of such field purchase orders or procurement cards shall be prescribed by rules adopted by the commissioner of administrative services pursuant to RSA 541-A in consultation with the state treasurer, or in the department's manual of procedures described in RSA 21-I:14, I.  Rules or procedures adopted by the commissioner relative to procurement cards shall include processes for monitoring the use of such cards.  Procurement cards shall be used only for state purposes.  Unauthorized use of a procurement card may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.  Any person who knowingly uses a procurement card in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  Agencies' use of procurement cards shall be subject to the limitations of the amounts appropriated by the legislature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the joint recommendation of the commissioner of administrative services and the governing board of any agency, the governor and council, in their discretion, may authorize such governing board, or one or more individuals designated by such governing board to purchase supplies for the agency directly from vendors in such quantities and for such sums as the governor and council shall prescribe;  provided, however, that any such authority shall be subject to the limitations of the amounts appropriated and the purposes authorized by the legislature for the agency, and provided further that all such delegations of purchasing authority shall expire on December 31 of the even numbered years.  Whenever such purchasing authority is so delegated to any agency, the requirements of RSA 21-I:11, I(a)(3) and (4) and rules adopted pursuant to RSA 21-I:14, XII, shall apply to the governing board or its authorized agent exercising such delegated authority.
