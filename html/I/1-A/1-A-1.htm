I. "The New Hampshire coordinate system of 1927'', as defined by the former United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, means a transverse mercator projection of the Clarke spheroid of 1866, having a standard meridian at 71%A140%2C along which meridian the scale shall be one part in 30,000 too small.  The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the said meridian 70%A140%2C west of Greenwich and the parallel 42%A130%2C north latitude.  This origin is given the coordinates:  x = 500,000 feet and y = 0 feet.

II. "The New Hampshire coordinate system of 1983'', as defined by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, means a transverse mercator projection of the North American datum of 1983, having a standard meridian at 71%A140%2C along which meridian the scale shall be one part in 30,000 too small.  The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the said meridian 71%A140%2C west of Greenwich and the parallel 42%A130%2C north latitude.  This origin is given the coordinates:  x = 300,000 meters and y = 0 meters.
