In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "The New Hampshire coordinate system of 1927'', as defined by the former United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, means a transverse mercator projection of the Clarke spheroid of 1866, having a standard meridian at 71%A140%2C along which meridian the scale shall be one part in 30,000 too small.  The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the said meridian 70%A140%2C west of Greenwich and the parallel 42%A130%2C north latitude.  This origin is given the coordinates:  x = 500,000 feet and y = 0 feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "The New Hampshire coordinate system of 1983'', as defined by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, means a transverse mercator projection of the North American datum of 1983, having a standard meridian at 71%A140%2C along which meridian the scale shall be one part in 30,000 too small.  The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the said meridian 71%A140%2C west of Greenwich and the parallel 42%A130%2C north latitude.  This origin is given the coordinates:  x = 300,000 meters and y = 0 meters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 1-A:2 Application of Coordinate Systems. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The use of the term "New Hampshire coordinate system of 1927'' or "New Hampshire coordinate system of 1983'' on any map, report of survey, or other document shall be limited to coordinates based on the New Hampshire coordinate system as defined in RSA 1-A:1.  The New Hampshire coordinate system of 1927 shall not be used after December 31, 1989.  The New Hampshire coordinate system of 1983 shall be the sole coordinate system used on or after January 1, 1990.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 1-A:3 Systems of Plane Coordinates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The systems of plane coordinates which have been established by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey or its successors for defining and stating the geographic positions or locations of points on the surface of the earth within the state of New Hampshire are hereafter to be known and designated as the New Hampshire coordinate system of 1927 and the New Hampshire coordinate system of 1983.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 1-A:4 Plane Coordinate Values. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, used to express the geographic position or location of such point in this system, shall consist of 2 distances expressed in United States survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the New Hampshire coordinate system of 1927 and expressed in meters and decimals of a meter and United States survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the New Hampshire coordinate system of 1983.  One of these distances, to be known as the "x-coordinate,'' shall give the position in an east-and-west direction;  the other, to be known as the "y-coordinate,'' shall give the position in a north-and-south direction.  These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as published by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter.  Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to either New Hampshire coordinate system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 1-A:5 Recording Coordinates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No coordinates based on either the 1927 or 1983 New Hampshire coordinate system, purporting to define the position of a point on a land boundary, shall be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless the licensed land surveyor in charge attaches a certification regarding the beginning coordinate source, distance traversed to establish the final coordinates, and adheres to third-order geodetic surveying procedures or better, in effect at the time of the survey as outlined by the Federal Geodetic Control Committee or its successors.
