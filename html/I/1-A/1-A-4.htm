&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 1-A:4 Plane Coordinate Values. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, used to express the geographic position or location of such point in this system, shall consist of 2 distances expressed in United States survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the New Hampshire coordinate system of 1927 and expressed in meters and decimals of a meter and United States survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the New Hampshire coordinate system of 1983.  One of these distances, to be known as the "x-coordinate,'' shall give the position in an east-and-west direction;  the other, to be known as the "y-coordinate,'' shall give the position in a north-and-south direction.  These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as published by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter.  Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to either New Hampshire coordinate system.
