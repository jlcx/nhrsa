&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-G:18 Security Documents. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any bonds issued pursuant to RSA 12-G:17-28 may be issued pursuant to and entitled to the benefits of a security document between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, or by a security document directly between the authority and the purchasers of the bonds, and such security document shall be in such form and executed in such manner as may be determined by the board.  Such security document may include the mortgage, pledge, or grant of a security interest in any airport property of the authority and may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues held or to be received by the authority, excluding any division revenues, any contract or other rights to receive the revenues, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the authority, and any proceeds thereof, excluding any division revenues.  Such security documents may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may, in the discretion of the board, be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.  Such security documents may include provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event of defaults, which may include the acceleration of maturities and the enforcement of any mortgage, pledge, or security interest, and covenants setting forth the duties of, and limitations on, the authority in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of moneys, the issue of additional or refunding bonds, the fixing, revision, and collection of rates, charges, and other revenues, the use of any surplus bond proceeds, the establishment of reserves, the acquisition of any property or interest therein, or undertaking of any project, any contracts relating thereto, and subsequent amendments of such provisions and contracts.  It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company to act as a depository or trustee of the proceeds of bonds, revenues, or other moneys under a security document and to furnish such indemnification or to pledge such securities and issue such letters or lines of credit or credit facilities as may be required by the authority acting under RSA 12-G:17-28.  Any such security document may set forth the rights and remedies of bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.
