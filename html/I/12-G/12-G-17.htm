&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-G:17 Issuance of Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The authority may issue bonds which shall be obligations of the authority and not general obligations of the state, except as provided in RSA 12-G:31.  Such bonds may be issued from time to time consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter, including, without limitation, financing the preacquisition costs and other costs of acquisition of any property or interest therein at Pease Air Force Base, or for any costs incurred in undertaking any airport project authorized by this chapter, or for paying or refunding any bonds issued pursuant to this section or interest thereon.  The principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all bonds shall be payable solely by the authority in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  Prior to each new issuance of bonds, the authority shall provide written notice to the state treasurer of the maximum amount of bonds proposed to be issued.  The bonds shall be issued by the authority in such amounts as the board shall determine, not exceeding in the aggregate $250,000,000. Bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker's loan rate, or other method as may be determined by the board, and shall mature at such time or times as may be determined by the board, except that no bonds shall mature more than 30 years from their date of issue.  Bonds may be made redeemable before maturity either at the option of the authority or at the option of the holder, or upon the occurrence of specified events, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the board prior to the issuance of the bonds.  The board shall determine the form and details of the bond.  Subject to RSA 93-A, the bonds shall be signed by at least 4 members of the board.  The bonds may be sold in such manner, either at public or private sale, for such price, at such rate or rates of interest, or at such discount in lieu of interest as the board may determine.
