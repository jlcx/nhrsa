&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except for any classified employee as provided in paragraph IV, the authority may hire, fix, and pay compensation, prescribe duties and qualifications, and establish personnel policies without regard to any personnel or civil service law or personnel or civil service rule of the state.  Except for any classified employee of the division, the employees of the authority shall not be classified employees of the state within the meaning of RSA 21-I:49.  Except for any classified employee of the division, any individual employed by the authority shall be an employee at will and shall serve at the pleasure of the authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any nonclassified employee's service with the authority, including employment with the authority prior to the effective date of this paragraph, shall be credited to such employee as continuous state service for all purposes, including without limitation rate of pay, determination of seniority and years of state service, longevity pay, and annual, sick, or other forms of leave.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, any individual employed by the authority, except for any classified employee of the authority, whose employment calls for 30 hours or more work in a normal calendar week, and whose position is anticipated to have a duration of 6 months or more, shall be entitled to elect to receive such health, dental, life insurance, deferred compensation, and retirement benefits as are afforded to classified employees of the state.  Upon election by such individual, the authority shall pay from its revenues the state's share of such benefits.  Any remaining costs of health, dental, life insurance, deferred compensation, and retirement benefits which an individual elects to receive pursuant to this section, shall be withheld from such individual's salary as a payroll deduction.  Written notice of the availability of these benefit options shall be provided to each individual upon employment by the authority.  This paragraph shall not apply to any classified employee of the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The state classified positions of the port authority shall be transferred to the authority when the duties, functions, and jurisdiction of the port authority are transferred to the authority.  Any person employed in such a position at the time of such transfer or at any time subsequent thereto shall be deemed a classified employee of the division.  All classified employees of the division shall be classified employees of the state of New Hampshire within the meaning of RSA 21-I:49 and shall be subject to all requirements, and be entitled to all benefits and emoluments, of the state personnel system.  Nothing herein shall preclude the general court from increasing or decreasing the number of classified positions within the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any person holding or appointed to the position of chief harbor master or deputy chief harbor master shall be a certified police officer and a group II member of the state retirement system.  If such person is not a member of the state retirement system at the time of employment as chief harbor master or deputy chief harbor master, such person shall become immediately upon appointment a member of the retirement system subject to the requirements of such system then in effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority or the executive director may assign as necessary any employee of the authority with appropriate skills and training to perform any responsibility, task, or duty assigned by statute to the authority or the division, including without limitation, on a temporary basis, any responsibility, task, or duty previously or otherwise assigned to any classified employee of the division.  To the extent that the wages, salary, benefits, or other expenses, including without limitation reasonable overhead expenses, of any employee of the authority assigned to carry out any responsibility, task, or duty of the division are paid from the fund established under RSA 12-G:36 or revenues of the authority other than division revenues, such fund or other source of revenue shall be reimbursed for the cost of such wages, salary, benefits, and other expenses, including without limitation reasonable overhead expenses, from funds drawn from the fund established under RSA 12-G:37 and, to the extent authorized, from the fund established under RSA 12-G:46.  The executive director of the authority, subject to the approval of the board, is authorized to determine and fix, as necessary, rates of reimbursement.
