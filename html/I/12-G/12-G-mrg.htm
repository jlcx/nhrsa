&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-G:1 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court recognizes that the closure and redevelopment of Pease Air Force Base is a matter of great concern for the town of Newington, the city of Portsmouth, the seacoast region, and the state of New Hampshire.  Therefore, the general court finds that a comprehensive study of all issues related to the closure and redevelopment of Pease Air Force Base is necessary to ensure proper planning and optimal use of the property.  The study shall have as a primary concern the impact of the closure and redevelopment of Pease Air Force Base on the economies, environment, and quality of life of the affected communities, the seacoast region, and the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court further recognizes that the economies, environment, and quality of life of the affected communities, the seacoast region, and the state will depend on the speedy and proper redevelopment of Pease Air Force Base.  Thus, it is hereby declared to be in the public interest and to be the policy of the state to foster and promote the redevelopment of Pease Air Force Base by implementing the comprehensive conversion and redevelopment plan being prepared by the former Pease Air Force Base redevelopment commission and the Pease development authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is further declared that creation of a development authority to implement the comprehensive conversion and redevelopment plan and to promote, oversee, and integrate the development of Pease Air Force Base is in all respects for the benefit of the affected communities, the seacoast region, and the state and for the improvement of their welfare and prosperity, including the creation of employment and other business opportunities.  It is also the intent of the general court that the authority be empowered to assume from the Pease Air Force Base redevelopment commission the responsibility for obtaining federal approval of the comprehensive conversion and redevelopment plan and complete any steps in the planning process that may remain incomplete as of July 1, 1990, and to create a development authority with the power, duties, and authority to implement all aspects of the comprehensive conversion and redevelopment plan subject to provisions of this chapter, including without limitation, taking title in the name of the state of New Hampshire, acting by and through the authority, to any or all of Pease Air Force Base.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The general court further recognizes that integration of the functions of the former New Hampshire state port authority with the functions and duties of the Pease Development Authority will allow for faster and more coordinated development of New Hampshire ports with the conversion and redevelopment of Pease Air Force Base.  Thus, it is declared to be in the public interest and the policy of the state to combine in one authority all power, authority, and responsibility for the promotion and development of Pease Air Force Base and the ports of New Hampshire for the benefit of the seacoast region and all of the citizens of New Hampshire.  It is also the intent of the general court that in the furtherance of its responsibility to promote and develop New Hampshire ports that they remain working ports with due consideration given to the commercial, recreational, and private interests associated therewith.

In addition, the building code boards of appeal, the zoning boards of adjustment, and the planning boards of the respective municipalities shall process building code appeals, administrative appeals, special exception and variance requests, as well as subdivision, site plan review, and conditional use applications.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI.

All airport property within the boundaries of Pease Air Force Base but outside of the airport district located thereon that is owned or occupied by a person, other than the authority or any other entity exempted from taxation under RSA 72:23, shall be taxable by the municipality in which the property is located as though such property were not owned by the exempt entity and were held in fee simple.  Upon leasing or renting by the authority of any of its airport property outside the airport district to a non-exempt entity for any use, the municipality in which such property is located shall subject such property to any and all applicable property taxes of the municipality as though such property were not owned by the state or authority and were held in fee simple.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Any bonds issued pursuant to RSA 12-G:17-28 may be issued pursuant to and entitled to the benefits of a security document between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, or by a security document directly between the authority and the purchasers of the bonds, and such security document shall be in such form and executed in such manner as may be determined by the board.  Such security document may include the mortgage, pledge, or grant of a security interest in any airport property of the authority and may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues held or to be received by the authority, excluding any division revenues, any contract or other rights to receive the revenues, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the authority, and any proceeds thereof, excluding any division revenues.  Such security documents may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may, in the discretion of the board, be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.  Such security documents may include provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event of defaults, which may include the acceleration of maturities and the enforcement of any mortgage, pledge, or security interest, and covenants setting forth the duties of, and limitations on, the authority in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of moneys, the issue of additional or refunding bonds, the fixing, revision, and collection of rates, charges, and other revenues, the use of any surplus bond proceeds, the establishment of reserves, the acquisition of any property or interest therein, or undertaking of any project, any contracts relating thereto, and subsequent amendments of such provisions and contracts.

Any such security document may set forth the rights and remedies of bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.
