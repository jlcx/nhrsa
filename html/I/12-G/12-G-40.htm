&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-G:40 Improvements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The authority, with the approval of the governor and council as to the nature and specifications of the intended project and the cost thereof, may undertake the improvement of any land acquired by it pursuant to RSA 12-G:39 by the construction thereon of piers, wharves, docks, warehouses, or other facilities as specified in RSA 12-G:39.  Any such improvement shall, insofar as possible, be self-liquidating;  and the authority shall charge just and reasonable fees for the use thereof.  All revenue received from such fees shall be considered division revenues, shall be accounted for separately from other revenues of the authority, and, after the deduction therefrom of the cost of operating such project, shall be applied to the amortization of any obligations of the authority related to division projects.
