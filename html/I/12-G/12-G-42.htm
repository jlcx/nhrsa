The rules adopted under this paragraph shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 541-A, so as to provide the authority with the ability to maximize revenues and to adjust fees according to market conditions and trends as is the common practice in private industry.  Fees established pursuant to this paragraph shall be consistent with the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Fees relating to the establishment and operation of foreign trade zones shall be designed to recover a reasonable portion of budget expenses consistent with the purposes of RSA 12-G:38.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
