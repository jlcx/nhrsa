&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-G:13 Local Land Use Controls. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any and all land use controls of the town of Newington and the city of Portsmouth shall not apply to any of the property at Pease Air Force Base transferred, conveyed, or otherwise granted to the authority by the federal government or any agency thereof.  The authority shall have the exclusive jurisdiction in adopting and establishing land use controls for the property at Pease Air Force Base transferred, conveyed, or otherwise granted to the authority by the federal government or any agency thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority shall adopt land use controls including, without limitation, regulations to establish zones, building codes, subdivision regulations, site plan review, and fire codes in order to implement the comprehensive conversion and redevelopment plan prepared by the commission no later than December 31, 1991.  All land use controls and amendments to such controls shall be enacted in accordance with rules of procedure adopted by the authority and shall include at least one public hearing.  In order to adopt, amend, interpret, or override any land use control, 5 affirmative votes of the authority shall be required.  All land use controls enacted by the authority shall be filed in the Rockingham county registry of deeds, the clerk's office for the town of Newington, the clerk's office for the city of Portsmouth, and the New Hampshire office of energy and planning.  This paragraph shall not apply to any division property or projects listed on the inventory required under RSA 12-G:43, I(e).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In adopting land use controls, the authority may adopt, in whole or in part, the land use controls of the town of Newington and/or the city of Portsmouth.  If the authority opts not to adopt the land use controls of Newington and/or Portsmouth, in whole or in part, the authority shall adopt its own land use controls which are consistent with the comprehensive conversion and redevelopment plan prepared by the commission and consistent with the master plans of the town of Newington and the city of Portsmouth.  This paragraph shall not apply to any division property or projects listed on the inventory required under RSA 12-G:43, I(e).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The land use controls and any amendments to them adopted by the authority shall only apply to all airport property at Pease Air Force Base acquired by the authority from the federal government or any agency thereof, and shall remain applicable and enforceable after the sale, lease, assignment, or other transfer of any or all of such property to such person by the authority.  All other property at Pease Air Force Base shall be subject to all land use controls of the municipalities in which such property is located.  This paragraph shall not apply to any division property or projects listed on the inventory required under RSA 12-G:43, I(e).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. With the exception of the airport zone and that portion of the airport industrial zone acquired by the authority pursuant to the Surplus Property Act of 1944, section 13(g), in the enforcement of land use controls, the following shall apply to property located at Pease Air Force Base:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The authority shall delegate enforcement of the land use controls to the appropriate land use boards of the town of Newington and the city of Portsmouth for airport property within each municipality, respectively.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the town of Newington or the city of Portsmouth, as appropriate, rejects the enforcement on the basis of Part I, Art. 28-a of the New Hampshire constitution, the authority may delegate such enforcement to the community which did not reject it or to another community.  If the town of Newington and/or the city of Portsmouth elects to perform said enforcement, the building inspection services, zoning enforcement services, and planning services of Portsmouth and/or Newington shall be made available to the authority for all land within the authority's control.  In addition, the building code boards of appeal, the zoning boards of adjustment, and the planning boards of the respective municipalities shall process building code appeals, administrative appeals, special exception and variance requests, as well as subdivision, site plan review, and conditional use applications.  The only charge that may be made for such services shall be the standard application fees charged by the municipalities for local permits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In all instances, the authority shall retain the power to make the final decision regarding applicability, interpretation, and enforcement of its land use controls, which shall require 5 affirmative votes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any action of the authority in the exercise of its powers under this section shall be subject to a motion for rehearing and appeal in accordance with the appropriate provisions of RSA 677.  In addition to any other person deemed to be an aggrieved person, the city of Portsmouth and the town of Newington and any abutters shall have standing to appeal land use decisions made by the authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any property located at the former Pease Air Force Base which is sold, leased, or otherwise conveyed by the United States government to any person other than the state of New Hampshire or one of its political subdivisions shall be in full compliance with all applicable municipal land use regulations, building codes, electrical codes, plumbing codes, and related codes prior to being occupied for any use by any person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The authority, after notice and hearing and in addition to any contract right or other power, may impose an administrative fine not to exceed $2,000 for each offense upon any person who violates any provision of the authority's land use controls applicable to the airport zone or that portion of the airport industrial zone acquired by the authority pursuant to the Surplus Property Act of 1944, section 13(g).  The proceeds of any administrative fine levied pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Pease Development Authority Airport Fund.  The authority shall adopt rules relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A schedule of administrative fines which may be imposed under this paragraph for violations of the authority's land use controls as provided in this paragraph;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Procedures for notice and hearing prior to imposition of an administrative fine;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Procedures for rehearings and appeals to the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Any final action by the board in the exercise of the authority's powers under this section shall be subject to appeal in accordance with RSA 677.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, all property on Pease Air Force Base west of McIntyre Road shall be designated a wildlife preserve under the control of the United States Department of the Interior, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wildlife Refuge, or other appropriate federal or state agency.  Except for the establishment of a national veteran cemetery, the authority shall not permit the development of the property designated a wildlife refuge or preserve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In any event, regulatory power over all land use controls at Pease Air Force Base, except for the airport district and all property west of McIntyre Road designated as a wildlife preserve, shall revert exclusively to the municipalities no later than January 1, 2050, or sooner at the election of the authority.
