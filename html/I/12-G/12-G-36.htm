<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no revenues of the authority other than division revenues shall be used for or paid on account of any obligation or liability of the authority related to or arising out of the ownership, operation, or maintenance of the division, division property, or any division project.
