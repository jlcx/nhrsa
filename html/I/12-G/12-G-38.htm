I. The authority shall be and is hereby authorized to make application to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for the purpose of having Pease Air Force Base, or portions thereof, designated, established, or constituted, a port of entry, or an international airport, pursuant to the Customs Reorganization Act, 19 U.S.C. section 1 et seq., as amended, and 19 U.S.C. section 58b, as amended, and regulations of the United States Customs Service, including 19 C.F.R. section 101.0 et seq. and 19 C.F.R. section 122.1 et seq.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority shall be and hereby is authorized to make application to the Secretary of Commerce of the United States for the purpose of establishing, operating, and maintaining foreign-trade zones in the state of New Hampshire, including without limitation at Pease Air Force Base, pursuant to the Foreign Trade Zones Act, 19 U.S.C. section 81a et seq., as amended, providing for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of foreign trade zones in or adjacent to ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for other purposes.  Unless precluded by federal law, any foreign trade zone previously under the jurisdiction of the former port authority, and all duties, responsibilities, and obligations associated therewith, shall be transferred to the authority when the duties, functions, and jurisdiction of the port authority are transferred to the authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The authority shall have full power and authority to select and describe the location of the zone for which application to establish may be made and to make such rules and take such other actions concerning the operation, maintenance, and policing of same as may be necessary to comply with the Foreign Trade Zones Act and the regulations adopted thereunder, or as may be necessary to comply with such regulations made in accordance with the acts of Congress relating to foreign trade zones.  The authority hereby granted to the authority confers on the authority the right and duty to do all things necessary and proper to carry into effect the establishing, maintaining, and operating of foreign trade zones with the state of New Hampshire to comply with the provisions of any acts of Congress or rules promulgated thereunder relating to foreign trade zones.  The authority shall also be authorized to set and collect fees for the management of any foreign trade zone established or maintained under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The authority shall have full power and authority to lease the right or to erect, maintain, and operate any structures or buildings or enclosures as may be necessary or proper for the establishing and operating of any such foreign trade zones that might be established at Pease Air Force Base or in the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The authority shall have the power and the duty to establish areas at Pease Air Force Base and in and around the ports and state tidal waters wherein personal property in transit shall be exempt from the provisions of the stock-in-trade tax and such other taxes and customs as are normally levied in a port of entry.  For the purpose of this section, personal property in transit through the areas established by the authority is defined as follows:  goods, wares, and merchandise which is (a) moving in interstate or international commerce through or over the areas hereinbefore established, or (b) which was consigned to a warehouse, public or private, within the state, from outside the state, whether specified when transportation begins or afterward.  Such property shall not be deprived of exemption because while in the warehouse the property is assembled, bound, joined, processed, disassembled, divided, cut, broken in bulk, relabeled, or repackaged.  The exemption granted shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes of this chapter, provided, however, that the warehouse in which said goods, wares, or merchandise is stored shall not be owned, in whole or in part, by either the consignee or consignor.
