I. As used in this subdivision the following words and terms shall have the following meanings:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Voluntary corporation,'' a corporation organized under RSA 292, dedicated by its articles of agreement and bylaws to serve and promote the recreational interests of the state of New Hampshire or a section thereof and which may number among its members certain corporations actively engaged in developing and promoting recreational facilities in the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Package plan program,'' a method of selling tickets by which the department of resources and economic development, in conjunction with a voluntary corporation, offers for sale to the general public interchangeable or reciprocal tickets for services and accommodations, or both, in connection with recreational facilities of both the state and the voluntary corporation or any of its members.  The charges for services and accommodations when sold in this manner may be less than when sold individually.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of resources and economic development may participate in package plan programs with voluntary corporations as defined in this section.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this participation may include entering into such agreements with voluntary corporations as are in the best interests of the state, which agreements may relate to the development, promotion, administration, and sales of package plan programs.  Such agreements shall permit the department of resources and economic development to provide to the voluntary corporation a mutually agreed upon number of tickets or vouchers for tickets at a mutually agreed upon discounted rate in order to participate in the package plan program for promotional purposes or in lieu of dues to the voluntary corporation.  Any revenue derived by participation in package plan programs payable to the department of resources and economic development in accordance with such agreements shall be deposited with the state treasurer in the same manner as regular ticket sales.  The commissioner of the department of resources and economic development shall make quarterly reports on revenue derived from participation in package plan programs to the senate president, the speaker of the house, and governor and council.
