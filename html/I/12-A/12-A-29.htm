<codesect>
The director, with the approval of the commissioner, may provide for differentials in rates, fees, and charges at state ski operations when the quality of a facility is poor due to such natural causes as inadequate snow, ice conditions, cold, rain, or other environmental or equipment problems or for the purpose of cooperative marketing or market experimentation.
