&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-M:1 Findings;  Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that, despite the highly skilled work performed and the excellent reputation attained by the office of the attorney general over the years, there is a need for more opportunities for career advancement within the office.  It further finds an ever-increasing need for greater emphasis on newer fields of endeavor such as consumer protection and environmental protection, in addition to a steadily rising demand on the office in the areas of criminal justice and assistance to other state departments.  Further, the general court finds the attorney general is in great need of assistance in the administration of the functions of the office by the establishment of intermediate levels of supervision.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The committee shall adopt a protocol defining which deaths shall be reported to the committee and subject to review, and which deaths may be screened out for review, such as deaths where the cause is natural, expected, and non-preventable.  The committee shall also determine whether it is appropriate to have different types of review, such as comprehensive or more limited reviews depending on the incident under review or the purpose of the review.

Records of the committee, including testimony by persons participating in or appearing before the committee and deliberations by committee members relating to the review of any death, shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.  However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources shall not be construed as immune from discovery from the original sources or used in any such civil or administrative action merely because they were presented to the committee, and any person who appears before the committee or supplies information as part of a committee review, or who is a member of the committee, may not be prevented from testifying as to matters within his or her knowledge, but such witness may not be asked about his or her statements before the committee, participation as a member of the committee, or opinions formed by him or her or any other member of the committee, as a result of participation in a review conducted by the committee.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII.

The committee may also issue special reports when doing so is necessary to alert authorities or the public to the need for prompt corrective action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The meetings and records of the committee shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A.  The committee's reports shall not include any private or privileged information.  Members of the committee may be required to sign a confidentiality agreement that prohibits any unauthorized dissemination of information beyond the purpose of the review process as a condition of membership.
