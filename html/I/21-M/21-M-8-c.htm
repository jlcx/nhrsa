&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-M:8-c Victim of Alleged Sexual Offense. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If a physician or a hospital provides any physical examination of a victim of an alleged sexual offense to gather information and evidence of the alleged crime, these services shall be provided without charge to the individual.  Upon submission of appropriate documentation, the physician or hospital shall be reimbursed for the cost of such examination by the department of justice to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of a third party under a health insurance policy or similar third party obligation.  The bill for the medical examination of a sexual assault victim shall not be sent or given to the victim or the family of the victim.  The privacy of the victim shall be maintained to the extent possible during third party billings.  Billing forms shall be subject to the same principles of confidentiality applicable to any other medical record under RSA 151:13.  Where such forms are released for statistical or accounting services, all personal identifying information shall be deleted from the forms prior to release.
