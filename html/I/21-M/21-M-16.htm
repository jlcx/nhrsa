(a) Adults who are clients of the area agency system pursuant to RSA 171-A or RSA 137-K at the time of the person's death or within one year of the person's death.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Adults who were in need of any of the services defined in subparagraphs (a)- (d) and paragraph IV-a at the time of their death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. For the purposes of this section, "vulnerable adult'' means an adult who was the reported victim of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation which was reported to the department of health and human services pursuant to RSA 161-F:46, where the report was determined to be unfounded and was filed within 6 months prior to death, where the report was determined to be founded and was filed within 3 years prior to death, or where the report was pending at the time of death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The committee shall adopt a protocol defining which deaths shall be reported to the committee and subject to review, and which deaths may be screened out for review, such as deaths where the cause is natural, expected, and non-preventable.  The committee shall also determine whether it is appropriate to have different types of review, such as comprehensive or more limited reviews depending on the incident under review or the purpose of the review.  The protocol shall also define the character of the contents of the committee's annual report, required under paragraph VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The committee's review of a case shall not be initiated until such time as any related criminal action has been finally adjudicated at the trial court level.  Records of the committee, including testimony by persons participating in or appearing before the committee and deliberations by committee members relating to the review of any death, shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.  However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources shall not be construed as immune from discovery from the original sources or used in any such civil or administrative action merely because they were presented to the committee, and any person who appears before the committee or supplies information as part of a committee review, or who is a member of the committee, may not be prevented from testifying as to matters within his or her knowledge, but such witness may not be asked about his or her statements before the committee, participation as a member of the committee, or opinions formed by him or her or any other member of the committee, as a result of participation in a review conducted by the committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The committee shall make an annual report, on or before the first day of November each year, beginning on November 1, 2008, to the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, and the governor describing any trends and patterns of deaths or serious injuries or risk factors, together with any recommendations for changes in law, policy, and practice that will prevent deaths and related serious occurrences.  The committee may also issue special reports when doing so is necessary to alert authorities or the public to the need for prompt corrective action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The meetings and records of the committee shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A.  The committee's reports shall not include any private or privileged information.  Members of the committee may be required to sign a confidentiality agreement that prohibits any unauthorized dissemination of information beyond the purpose of the review process as a condition of membership.
