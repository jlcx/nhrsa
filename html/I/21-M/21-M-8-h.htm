If the victim is incompetent or in the case of a victim's death as a direct result of the crime, the immediate family of the victim is eligible to claim compensation.  In this section, immediate family of the victim shall include the surviving partner in a civil union.  In the case of a victim's disability as a direct result of the crime, the victim's legal representative may claim compensation in the victim's stead.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A family member of a law enforcement officer, an inmate at a state or county correctional facility, and an individual who is not a citizen of the United States or who is not a legal alien shall be considered victims eligible for compensation under this section.

II. The claimant, guardian ad litem or child advocate, or parent may file a claim for compensation within 2 years of the crime, unless good cause is shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A claimant shall not be deemed ineligible for compensation based solely upon failure to apprehend the offender, or based solely upon failure of the state to obtain a conviction against the offender, providing there is reasonable evidence to sustain the claim that a crime had been committed which resulted in injury to the victim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission may consider the finding of innocence or guilt of the alleged offender in arriving at their determination of eligibility of the claimant.  In determining eligibility and the amount of compensation to be awarded, the commission shall consider the contributory fault of the victim in causing his injury.  If compensation is paid to members of the accused's immediate family, or persons who reside with or who have maintained a continuous relationship with the accused, the accused shall receive no benefit or enrichment as a result of payment of such compensation.
<br>

Claimants eligible under subparagraph I(a)(4) may be reimbursed for the costs of removing the tattoo with an identifying mark.  No reimbursement shall be paid unless the claimant has incurred reimbursable expenses of at least $100.  There shall be a $30,000 maximum recovery per claimant per incident.  If expenses paid through the victims' assistance program fund are later covered by insurance settlements, civil suit settlements, or restitution, or through any other source, the claimant shall reimburse the fund for the amount of expenses recovered.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. Notwithstanding any right by a victim to claim restitution or a court order for restitution under RSA 651:62-67, a victim shall be eligible for compensation under this section.

Compensation under this paragraph shall be limited to qualified expenses incurred after the post-conviction DNA testing petition is filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X.
