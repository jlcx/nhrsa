<codesect>
The general court finds that, despite the highly skilled work performed and the excellent reputation attained by the office of the attorney general over the years, there is a need for more opportunities for career advancement within the office.  It further finds an ever-increasing need for greater emphasis on newer fields of endeavor such as consumer protection and environmental protection, in addition to a steadily rising demand on the office in the areas of criminal justice and assistance to other state departments.  Further, the general court finds the attorney general is in great need of assistance in the administration of the functions of the office by the establishment of intermediate levels of supervision.
