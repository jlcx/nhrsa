<center><h3>Section 4-E:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 4-E:1 State Energy Strategy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The office of energy planning, in consultation with the state energy advisory council established in RSA 4-E:2, with assistance from an independent consultant and with input from the public and interested parties, shall prepare a 10-year energy strategy for the state.  The office shall review the strategy and consider any necessary updates in consultation with the senate energy and natural resources committee and the house science, technology and energy committee, after opportunity for public comment, at least every 3 years starting in 2017.  The state energy strategy shall include, but not be limited to, sections on the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The projected demand for consumption of electricity, natural gas, and other fuels for heating and other related uses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Existing and proposed electricity and natural gas generation and transmission facilities, the effects of future retirements and new resources, and consideration of possible alternatives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Renewable energy and fuel diversity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Small-scale and distributed energy resources, energy storage technologies, and their potential in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The role of energy efficiency, demand response, and other demand-side resources in meeting the state's energy needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The processes for siting energy facilities in the state and the criteria used by the site evaluation committee in giving adequate consideration to the protection of the state's ecosystems and visual, historic, and aesthetic resources in siting processes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The relationship between land use and transportation policies and programs on electricity and thermal energy needs in the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) New Hampshire's role in the regional electric markets, how the regional market affects the state's energy policy goals, and how the state can most effectively participate at the regional level.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The strategy shall include a review of all state policies related to energy, including the issues in paragraph I, and recommendations for policy changes and priorities necessary to ensure the reliability, safety, fuel diversity, and affordability of New Hampshire's energy sources, while protecting natural, historic, and aesthetic resources and encouraging local and renewable energy resources.  The strategy shall also include consideration of the extent to which demand-side measures including efficiency, conservation, demand response, and load management can cost-effectively meet the state's energy needs, and proposals to increase the use of such demand resources to reduce energy costs and increase economic benefits to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The strategy development process shall include review and consideration of relevant studies and plans, including but not limited to those developed by the independent system operator of New England (ISO-NE), the public utilities commission, the energy efficiency and sustainable energy board, legislative study committees and commissions, and other state and regional organizations as appropriate.  The strategy shall also include consideration of new technologies and their potential impact on the state's energy future.
