<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The treasurer shall establish deposit procedures for all state departments and institutions receiving money for the state.  Such procedures shall include, but shall not be limited to, deposits to a department's or institution's bank accounts, related transfers to treasury bank accounts, electronically collecting state moneys, and concurrence of the treasurer for the opening of department and institution bank accounts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If more than $500 is in the possession of any state department or institution such funds shall be on deposit in the related department's bank account or in a treasury bank account.  The treasurer shall transfer moneys from state departments and institutions to the treasurer's account in the most expeditious manner possible, including, but not limited to, the use of electronic transfers.  If any facility of any state department or institution is in a location where there is no bank or other depository institution within 10 miles of that facility, that state department or institution shall make deposits at least on a weekly basis or when funds remitted total $1,500 or more.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All state departments and institutions, except the university system of New Hampshire, the building projects revolving fund of the state board of education, and the supreme court for the purposes of the escrow account for court facility improvements under RSA 490:26-c, receiving money for the state shall deposit the full amount of all such moneys into a state treasurer's bank account or into a state department's bank account from which the treasurer shall collect funds by automated means, unless the treasurer determines that such means cannot be implemented or concurs with department procedures for deposits and collection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All state departments and institutions, except those state departments and institutions which are exempted in RSA 6:11, III, which are not depositing directly into a treasury bank account or which are not included in a treasury electronic collection system may deposit state moneys into a department's bank account and shall either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Remit to treasury daily all moneys in excess of an amount established by each department with the concurrence of the treasurer;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Deposit all moneys at the department of treasury daily in accordance with rules established under RSA 6:3-a, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All state departments and institutions, except those state departments and institutions which are exempted in RSA 6:11, III, depositing moneys directly into a treasury bank account shall prepare and submit to treasury the appropriate accounting documentation.  Such departments and institutions shall make every effort to ensure that the documentation is received by treasury on the same day as the day of deposit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All state departments and institutions depositing moneys into a department's bank account shall, in a timely manner, prepare and submit to treasury the appropriate accounting documentation related to treasury's daily automated collections as provided in RSA 6:11, III or a department's remittances as provided in RSA 6:11, IV(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. All payments due to the state of New Hampshire for services provided shall be paid for in United States dollars.  Any payment received in any other currency shall be returned to the payor.  All outstanding obligations are subject to the terms and conditions of said payment.  Exceptions to the provisions of this paragraph are subject to the approval of the treasurer.
