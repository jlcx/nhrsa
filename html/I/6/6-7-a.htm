&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 6:7-a Cost of Bank Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The state treasurer may pay for the cost of bank services, securities transactions fees, and investment management fees from income generated by the treasury department.  If the income generated is insufficient to pay for the cost of bank services, security transaction fees, and investment management fees, payment may be made from funds not otherwise appropriated until such time as the income generated is sufficient to pay for the costs and fees.  If the income generated is insufficient to pay for the costs and fees at the end of the fiscal year, the governor may draw a warrant from funds not otherwise appropriated in an amount to cover the deficiency.
