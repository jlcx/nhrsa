<codesect>
The 10-year limitation does not apply to leases for state facility energy cost reduction projects pursuant to RSA 21-I:19-a through RSA 21-I:19-e, which shall be subject to the term limitation applicable to energy performance contracts, as defined therein.  The treasurer may establish financing criteria to be met by any state agency or department before entering into leases for equipment.  In no instance shall the term of such lease exceed 10 years.  For purposes of this section "leases'' shall include lease-purchase, sale and lease back, installment sale, or other similar agreements entered into by various agencies or departments to acquire such equipment from time to time for the agencies or departments;  provided that funding for such equipment leases was specifically approved by the legislature in a budget.  Payment obligations under any lease entered into under this section shall be subject to annual appropriation and shall not be treated as debt obligations of the state.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the treasurer from entering into financing agreements or executing any related documents, including any document creating or confirming any security interest retained by the seller or lessor of the equipment.
