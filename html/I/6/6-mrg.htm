<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Account'' means a formal record in the state's accounting system that represents, in words, money, or other unit of measurement, certain resources, claims to such resources, transactions, or other events that result in changes to those resources and claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Fund'' means a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts recording cash and other financial resources, together with all related liabilities and residual equity or balances and changes therein, which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific activities or attaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions, or limitations.  A fund can also be a grouping of related funds that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Dedicated fund or account'' means moneys collected by the state from a specific source in the form of taxes, fees, licenses, fines, donations, gifts, or other sources as designated by statute, a requirement of federal law, or other legal arrangements that must be spent for a specific program or purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Revolving fund or account'' means a fund or account that, when initially established, is intended for repeated expending and replenishment of resources for a specific program or purpose.

(f) "Trust'' means an arrangement, usually with a formal written agreement, contract, or will of deceased person, whereby money or other property is placed under the legal ownership and control of a person, the trustee, who is responsible for administering it, with specific instructions about how the principal or corpus is to be managed, invested, and disposed, for the benefit of others, the beneficiary or beneficiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) "Trustee'' means a person named in a trust agreement, as a trusted third party, to nominally own, protect, and manage moneys or other assets for the benefit of a beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  A trustee is usually charged with investing prudently and productively on behalf of the beneficiary and may be allowed some compensation or recovery of costs incurred in the administration of a trust.  Restrictions of a trust may include, but are not limited to, commingling other moneys or assets with that of the trust, entering into any transactions with the trust, and benefiting from the trust.  Only when the intention or the purpose of the trust is fulfilled may a trustee be discharged of these duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) "Agency fund or account'' means an arrangement whereby moneys or other assets are received by the state as an agent for other governmental units, other organizations, or individuals and are held in a custodial capacity.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) "Custodial fund or account'' means moneys or other assets owned by a person or entity but which are entrusted to and controlled by another, the custodian.  The role of the custodian includes, but is not limited to, holding such moneys or other assets in safekeeping, arranging for the settlement of any purchases or sales of such assets, collecting income from investments, and providing information to the owners of such moneys or other assets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(k) "Lapsing fund or account'' means moneys in funds or accounts which, if not spent at the end of the fiscal year or biennium, revert back to the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) "Nonlapsing fund or account'' means moneys in funds or accounts at the end of the fiscal year or biennium that do not revert back to the general fund but remain in the fund or account to be used in the next fiscal year and that are allowed to accumulate for use in future years.
