&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When it is anticipated that there will not be sufficient general funds in the treasury for the payment of obligations, the treasurer, under the direction of the governor and council, is authorized to borrow on the state's credit such sums as may be necessary, not to exceed the amount authorized by the governor and council, provided that at no time shall the indebtedness of the state, pursuant to the authority granted by this section exceed the sum of $200,000,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unless otherwise provided by the governor and council, the treasurer shall have the authority to borrow at one time, or from time to time, up to the aggregate amount authorized by the governor and council under this section, and to determine the amounts, dates, maturities, and other details of each borrowing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The treasurer, when authorized by the governor and council, may enter into agreements with banks or other financial institutions, within or without the state, in the form of lines or letters of credit or other banking arrangements in connection with any indebtedness incurred under this section or RSA 6-A:4.  The agreement may include covenants and provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security and remedies of the lenders as, in the discretion of the treasurer, may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.  Notes issued under this section or RSA 6-A:4 shall bear interest at such rate or rates as the treasurer may deem proper, including rates variable from time to time as determined by any index, banker's loan rate or other method specified in any such agreement.
