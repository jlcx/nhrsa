If the agency head disagrees with the attorney general's request, he or she shall be afforded the opportunity to confer with the governor before a decision on the transfer request is made.  When a transfer is made, all unexpended appropriations and funds allocated for the payment of the salary associated with such position shall be transferred from the agency to the department of justice, provided that if the unexpended appropriations and funds of the transferring agency are restricted by law, then any person filling the transferred position shall continue to perform legal work exclusively for the transferring agency in compliance with the funding restrictions.  Upon transfer from the agency to the department of justice, the position shall be converted to an unclassified position.

State agencies and departments may refer any uncollected debt owed to the state to the attorney general for collection after determining that a debt owed to the state cannot be collected through means other than an action in court.  All debts collected pursuant to this section shall be credited to the debt recovery fund established in paragraph IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No debt may be referred to the attorney general unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) There have been at least 2 documented attempts in writing to notify the debtor of the existence of the debt and of the fact that the debt may be assigned to the attorney general for collection if it is not paid;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At least 30 days have elapsed from the last notice attempt;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All applicable administrative remedies have been exhausted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The attorney general may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Compromise the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of the debt by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Cancel the debt or cause it to be cancelled if the attorney general finds, after investigation, that any debt due and owing to the state cannot be reasonably collected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) There is established in the office of the state treasurer a nonlapsing fund to be known as the debt recovery fund which shall be kept distinct and separate from all other funds.  The debt recovery fund is established to receive all recoveries of debts paid to the state under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A percentage of each amount collected under this section shall be retained in the debt recovery fund for the purpose of funding the costs of all debt collection.  The percentage shall be set annually by the attorney general in consultation with the commissioner of the department of administrative services at 150 percent of the total costs and expenses of the debt collection during the prior fiscal year divided by the total debt collected.  Any amount remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year in excess of 200 percent of the costs and expenses of debt collection during the fiscal year shall be paid in a proportional amount to the accounts for which they were collected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The treasurer shall deposit in the debt recovery fund all amounts collected by the department of justice under this section.  The attorney general is authorized to accept, budget, and expend moneys in the debt recovery fund received from any party without the approval of the governor and council for the purposes of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After deducting the amounts authorized in subparagraph IV(b), transferring on a quarterly basis a proportional amount recovered to the accounts for which they were collected;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Recruitment, training, administration, overhead, and supervision of such assistant attorneys general and support staff as necessary for the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) All moneys in the debt recovery fund shall be continually appropriated to the department of justice and shall not lapse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The state treasurer, upon approval of the attorney general, shall pay the expenses of recruitment, training, administration, and supervision of assistant attorneys general and support staff as necessary for the purposes of this section, and transfer a proportional amount of unretained funds recovered to the accounts for which they were collected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For purposes of this section, the term "debt'' shall include fines and other debts or amounts owed to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, and subject to the supervision of the attorney general as to matters of law, state agencies and departments may seek collection of debts in small claims court without referring the debt to the attorney general.  The authorization granted to seek collection of debts in small claims court under this paragraph shall not be construed to constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the state, or any other defense, right, immunity, or other protection under law, including any statutory provision.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the event of a vacancy in the office of assistant attorney general, the attorney general may downgrade such office to the position of attorney I, II or III in his discretion for the purpose of filling the same with a person lacking sufficient experience to qualify for the office of assistant attorney general.  Said position, when downgraded, shall entitle the person holding the same to all the rights and privileges of the classified state system except that the persons holding the same shall serve at the pleasure of the attorney general;  and provided, that no later than the expiration of 3 years from the initial date of employment, the person holding such position shall either be nominated and confirmed in the office of assistant attorney general as provided in RSA 7:16 for the unexpired term or shall be discharged.  In the event that said person is discharged, the attorney general may fill the vacancy in the office of assistant attorney general for the unexpired term as provided in RSA 7:16 or may again downgrade the position to attorney I, II, or III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The attorney general may designate up to 3 full-time unclassified assistant attorneys general positions as temporary, part-time positions, provided such positions are vacant at the time of such designation.

The attorney general may employ part-time assistant attorneys general up to the limit of funds available for the full-time positions designated by the attorney general for part-time employment.  A part-time assistant attorney general shall be governed by the same terms and conditions of employment as a full-time assistant attorney general, including the prohibition of the private practice of law under RSA 7:6-d, except that a part-time assistant attorney general shall serve at the pleasure of the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the duration of the temporary part-time positions designated under paragraph II of this section, the funds that would have been paid for benefits for the designated full-time positions, with the exception of social security benefits, shall be paid into the general fund of this state.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 7:19-a Regulation of Certain Transactions Involving Directors, Officers, and Trustees of Charitable Trusts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Definitions.  In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Director, officer, or trustee'' means a director, officer, or trustee of a charitable trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Financial interest'' means an interest in a transaction exceeding $500 in value for any officer, director, or trustee, on an annual aggregate basis.  An "indirect'' financial interest arises where the transaction involves a person or entity of which a director, officer, or trustee, or a member of the immediate family of a director, officer, or trustee, is a proprietor, partner, employee, or officer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Pecuniary benefit transaction'' means a transaction with a charitable trust in which a director, officer, or trustee of the charitable trust has a financial interest, direct or indirect.  However, the following shall not be considered as pecuniary benefit transactions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Reasonable compensation for services of an executive director, and expenses incurred in connection with official duties of a director, officer, or trustee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A benefit provided to a director, officer, or trustee or member of the immediate family thereof if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The benefits are provided or paid as part of programs, benefits, or payments to members of the general public;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The charitable trust has adopted written eligibility criteria for such benefit in accordance with its bylaws or applicable laws;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The director, trustee, or family member meets all of the eligibility criteria for receiving such benefit;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A continuing transaction entered into by a charitable trust, merely because a person with a financial interest therein subsequently becomes a director, officer, or trustee of the charitable trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Charitable trust'' does not include, for purposes of this section only, an organization qualified as a private foundation under the applicable provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A pecuniary benefit transaction shall be prohibited unless it is in the best interest of the charitable trust and unless all of the following conditions are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The transaction is for goods or services purchased or benefits provided in the ordinary course of the business of the charitable trust, for the actual or reasonable value of the goods or services or for a discounted value, and the transaction is fair to the charitable trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The transaction receives affirmative votes from at least a  2/3 majority of all the disinterested members of the governing board of the charitable trust, which majority shall also equal or exceed any quorum requirement specified in the bylaws of the charitable trust:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After full and fair disclosure of the material facts of the transaction to the governing board and after notice and full discussion of the transaction by the board;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Without participation, voting, or presence of any director, officer, or trustee with a financial interest in the transaction or who has had a pecuniary benefit transaction with the charitable trust in the same fiscal year, except as the board may require to answer questions regarding the transaction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A record of the action on the matter is made and recorded in the minutes of the governing board;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The charitable trust maintains a list disclosing each and every pecuniary benefit transaction, including the names of those to whom the benefit accrued and the amount of the benefit, and keeps such list available for inspection by members of the governing board and contributors to the charitable trust.  The list shall also be reported to the director of charitable trusts each year as part of the charitable trust's annual report required under RSA 7:28;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the transaction, or the aggregate of transactions with the same director, officer, or trustee within one fiscal year, is in the amount of $5,000 or more, the charitable trust publishes notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the community in which the charitable trust's principal New Hampshire office is located, (or if there is no such office, then in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the state), and gives written notice to the director of charitable trusts, before consummating the transaction.  At a minimum, such notice shall state that it is given in compliance with this section and shall include the name of the charitable trust, the name of any director, officer, or trustee receiving pecuniary benefit from the transaction, the nature of the transaction, and the specific dollar amount of the transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every director, officer, or trustee, or member of the immediate family of such director, officer, or trustee, who engages in a pecuniary benefit transaction with a charitable trust shall provide copies of all contracts, payment records, vouchers, other financial records or other financial documents at the request of the director of charitable trusts in accordance with RSA 7:24.  All documents so provided may be disclosed to the public for inspection and copying, subject to applicable confidentiality laws.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every charitable trust shall adopt policies pertaining to pecuniary benefit transactions and conflicts of interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No charitable trust shall lend money or property to its directors, officers, or trustees.  Any director, officer, or trustee who assents to or participates in the making of any such loan shall be jointly and severally liable to the charitable trust for the amount of such loan until it is repaid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No charitable trust shall sell, lease for a term of greater than 5 years, purchase, or convey any real estate or interest in real estate to or from an officer, director, or trustee without the prior approval of the probate court after a finding that the sale or lease is fair to the charitable trust.  However, this paragraph shall not apply to a bona fide gift of an interest in real estate to a charitable trust by a director, officer, or trustee of the charitable trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A pecuniary benefit transaction undertaken in violation of this section is voidable.  The director of charitable trusts may investigate complaints regarding pecuniary benefit transactions and if, after an investigation pursuant to RSA 7:24, the director determines that a pecuniary benefit transaction is in violation of this section, the director may institute appropriate proceedings under RSA 7:28-f to enforce these provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any member of the governing board of a charitable trust shall have standing to petition, pursuant to RSA 491:22, for a declaratory judgment that one or more pecuniary benefit transactions of the charitable trust are void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The provisions of this section shall not apply to transactions between a charitable trust and its incorporators, members, or other contributors who are not also directors, officers, or trustees of the charitable trust, provided that such transactions are fair to the charitable trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Notwithstanding subparagraph I(c) of this section, in the case of hospitals, "pecuniary benefit transaction'' shall not include reasonable compensation for professional services of members of the hospital's professional medical or nursing staff who also serve as members of the governing board of the hospital, if persons receiving such compensation do not constitute more than 25 percent of the membership of such board or the governing board of the charitable trust which owns the hospital.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Notwithstanding subparagraph I(c) of this section, in the case of educational organizations normally maintaining a regular faculty and curriculum and normally having a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where their educational activities are regularly carried on, "pecuniary benefit transaction'' shall not include reasonable compensation for professional services of members of the organization's faculty and staff who also serve as members of the governing board of the educational organization if such persons do not constitute more than 25 percent of the membership of such board.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 7:19-b Standards for Acquisition Transactions Involving Health Care Charitable Trusts and Review by Director of Charitable Trusts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Acquisition transaction'' or "acquisition'' means transfer of control, direct or indirect, of a health care charitable trust, or of 25 percent or more of the assets thereof, including, but not limited to, purchases, mergers, leases, gifts, consolidations, exchanges, joint ventures, or other transactions involving transfer of control or of 25 percent or more of assets.  However, changes in membership of the governing body of a health care charitable trust occurring through regular election or filling of vacancies in accordance with the bylaws thereof do not of themselves constitute acquisition transactions within the meaning of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Acquirer'' means a person acquiring control, direct or indirect, of a health care charitable trust, or of 25 percent or more of the assets thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Control'' of a health care charitable trust means the power to elect a majority or more of the membership of the governing body thereof, or otherwise to direct the affairs thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Health care charitable trust'' means a charitable trust organized to provide health care services including, but not limited to, hospitals, community health services, and medical-surgical or other diagnostic or therapeutic facilities or services, or a charitable trust operating as a health insurer or health maintenance organization.  "Health care charitable trust'' shall not include any testamentary or inter vivos trust which is not organized to provide health care services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The governing body of a health care charitable trust, or any other persons having authority to direct the affairs of a health care charitable trust, shall not approve the acquisition thereof unless the governing body has acted in good faith and in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to the health care charitable trust, and unless the following minimum standards are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The proposed transaction is permitted by applicable law, including, but not limited to, RSA 7:19-32, RSA 292, and other applicable statutes and common law;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Due diligence has been exercised in selecting the acquirer, in engaging and considering the advice of expert assistance, in negotiating the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction, and in determining that the transaction is in the best interest of the health care charitable trust and the community which it serves;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any conflict of interest, or any pecuniary benefit transaction as defined in this chapter, has been disclosed and has not affected the decision to engage in the transaction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The proceeds to be received on account of the transaction constitute fair value therefor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The assets of the health care charitable trust and any proceeds to be received on account of the transaction shall continue to be devoted to charitable purposes consistent with the charitable objects of the health care charitable trust and the needs of the community which it serves;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the acquirer is other than another New Hampshire health care charitable trust, control of the proceeds shall be independent of the acquirer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Reasonable public notice of the proposed transaction and its terms has been provided to the community served by the health care charitable trust, along with reasonable and timely opportunity for such community, through public hearing or other similar methods, to inform the deliberations of the governing body of the health care charitable trust regarding the proposed transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notice of a proposed acquisition transaction shall be given to the director of charitable trusts in writing to be received by the director no less than 120 days before consummation of the transaction.  Such notice shall identify all parties to the transaction;  shall set forth all material terms thereof, including, without limitation, any changes in control or ownership of assets, any acquisition price, any change in the capital structure and management, and any and all compensation paid or to be paid in connection therewith;  shall include a copy of the minutes and other documents evidencing the decision of the governing body of the health care charitable trust, including documentation of steps taken to comply with paragraph II(g) of this section and any changes in the proposed transaction resulting therefrom, any relevant community needs assessment developed by the health care charitable trust, and a copy of the acquisition agreement and financial statements of all parties;  and shall include a certification signed by those members of the governing body or other person approving the acquisition on behalf of the health care charitable trust that the standards set forth in paragraph II of this section have been considered in good faith and complied with, together with such explanations and other documentation as may be necessary to demonstrate such compliance.  The notice shall also include a statement from the acquirer specifying the manner in which it proposes to continue to fulfill the charitable objects of the health care charitable trust.  Any information submitted pursuant to this section shall be subject to RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within a reasonable time, not to exceed 120 days after receipt of the notice specified in the preceding paragraph, the director shall determine compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph II of this section and shall notify the parties either that the director will take no further action with respect thereto, or that the director objects to the transaction on specified grounds.  Within 60 days following receipt of the notice specified in the preceding paragraph, the director may require submittal of such additional information as may be reasonably necessary to make such a determination.  In making such a determination, the director shall accept public comment and may conduct public hearings relating thereto within the time specified in this paragraph and may direct the health care charitable trust to publish notice thereof in a manner reasonably specified by the director.  Such hearing may be conducted informally or in conformity with RSA 541-A, at the discretion of the director.  The expenses of such public hearing shall be paid for by the parties to the proposed transaction, after consultation with the parties.  Where the acquisition transaction involves assets, the fair value of which are in excess of $5,000,000, after consultation with the parties, the director may employ, at the parties' expense, expert assistance, including independent counsel and independent financial advisors that are reasonably necessary to make the determination specified in this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to all other powers conferred by statute or common law, the director may bring judicial proceedings to enjoin consummation of any acquisition transaction in which notice has not been provided in accordance with paragraph III of this section.  Any acquisition transaction which has been consummated following the effective date of this section without such notice having been provided, or any acquisition transaction of which such notice was deceptive or materially inaccurate, shall be voidable through appropriate judicial proceedings instituted by the director of charitable trusts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Nothing in this section shall derogate from authority of the attorney general, or the rights of others, provided by common law or other statute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This section shall not supplant or restrict the general powers of the probate courts with respect to charitable trusts pursuant to RSA 498, RSA 547:3 through 547:3-h, RSA 564-B:2-203, article 4 of RSA 564-B, or at common law.  Nor do the standards set forth in paragraph II of this section supplant or restrict the standards that may lawfully be applied in connection with the doctrines of cy pres, deviation, and termination as applicable by the probate courts of this state in such proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commissioner of insurance retains full jurisdiction to regulate any charitable trust operating as a health insurer or health maintenance organization, including through the application of RSA 401-B.  If the insurance commissioner determines that an acquisition or acquisition transaction otherwise subject to the provisions of this section is necessary to avoid the future impairment or insolvency of either or both of the merging health insurers or health maintenance organizations, the commissioner may waive any of the provisions of this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 7:21 Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For the purposes of this subdivision, the following words shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Charitable sales promotion'' means an advertising or sales campaign, conducted by a commercial co-venturer, which represents that the purchase or use of goods or services offered by the commercial co-venturer shall benefit, in whole or in part, a charitable trust or purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) "Charitable trust'' means any fiduciary relationship with respect to property arising under the law of this state or of another jurisdiction as a result of a manifestation of intention to create it, and subjecting the person by whom the property is held to fiduciary duties to deal with the property within this state for any charitable, nonprofit, educational, or community purpose.  Charitable trust includes, but is not limited to "charitable organization,'' as that term is defined in subparagraph (b).  The fact that any person or entity sought to be charged with fiduciary duties is a corporation, association, foundation, or any other type of organization that, under judicial decisions or other statutes, has not been recognized as, or has been distinguished from, a charitable trust does not provide a presumption against its being a charitable trust as defined in this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Charitable organization'' means the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any person or entity that is determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be a tax exempt organization pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as that section now exists or may hereafter be amended;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any other person or entity that is or holds itself out to be established, in whole or in part, for any benevolent, philanthropic, patriotic, educational, humane, scientific, public health, environmental conservation, civic, or other charitable purpose or any person who in any manner employs a charitable appeal as the basis of any solicitation or an appeal that suggests that there is a charitable purpose to any solicitation.  "Charitable organization'' is not limited to those organizations to which contributions are tax deductible under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Commercial co-venturer'' means a person who for profit is regularly and primarily engaged in trade or commerce other than in connection with soliciting for charitable trusts or purposes and who conducts a charitable sales promotion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Contribution'' means the grant, promise, or pledge of money, credit, property, financial assistance, or other thing of any kind or value in response to a solicitation.  It does not include bona fide fees, dues or assessments paid by members, provided that membership is not conferred solely as consideration for making a contribution in response to a solicitation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Fund raising counsel'' means a person who for compensation plans, manages, advises, consults, or prepares material for, or with respect to, the solicitation in this state of contributions for a charitable trust, but who does not solicit contributions and who does not employ, procure, or engage any compensated person to solicit contributions.  No lawyer, investment counsellor, or banker who advises a person to make a contribution shall be deemed, as a result of such advice, to be a fund raising counsel.  A bona fide salaried officer, employee or volunteer of a charitable trust shall not be deemed to be a fund raising counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Paid solicitor'' means a person who for compensation performs for a charitable trust any service in connection with which contributions are or shall be solicited in this state by such compensated person or by any compensated person he employs, procures, or engages, directly or indirectly, to solicit.  No lawyer, investment counsellor, or banker who advises a person to make a charitable contribution shall be deemed, as the result of such advice, to be a paid solicitor.  A bona fide salaried officer, employee, or volunteer of a charitable trust shall not be deemed to be a paid solicitor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Solicit'' and "solicitation'' means the request directly or indirectly for money, credit, property, financial assistance, or other thing of any kind or value on the plea or representation that such money, credit, property, financial assistance, or other thing of any kind or value, or any portion thereof, shall be used for a charitable purpose or benefit a charitable trust.  Without limiting the scope of such terms, these words shall include the following methods of requesting or securing such money, credit, property, financial assistance or other thing of value:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any oral or written request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The making of any announcement to the press, by radio, television, telephone, or telegraph concerning an appeal or campaign by or for any charitable trust or purpose.

A solicitation shall be deemed to have taken place whether or not the person making the same receives any contribution.
<br>

VIII. "Trustee'' means:
<br>

(a) Any individual, group of individuals, corporation or other legal entity holding property in trust pursuant to any charitable trust or charitable purpose.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as otherwise provided, every trustee subject to this chapter shall, in addition to filing copies of the instruments required by RSA 7:28, I file with the attorney general periodic written reports, under oath, setting forth information as to the nature of the assets held for charitable purposes and the administration thereof by the trustee, the property so held or administered, the receipts and expenditures in connection therewith, the names and addresses of the beneficiaries thereof, the conduct of any charitable solicitation by the trustee, or the conduct of any charitable solicitation or charitable sales promotion on its behalf by others, and such other information as he may require, in accordance with the rules of the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The attorney general shall make rules and regulations as to the time for filing reports, the contents thereof, and the manner of executing and filing them.  He may classify trusts and other relationships concerning property held for a charitable purpose as to purpose, nature of assets, duration of the trust or other relationship, amount of assets, amounts to be devoted to charitable purposes, nature of trustee, or otherwise, and may establish different rules for the different classes as to time and nature of the reports required to the ends (a) that he shall receive reasonably current, periodic reports as to all charitable trusts or other relationships of a similar nature, which will enable him to ascertain whether they are being properly administered, and (b) that periodic reports shall not unreasonably add to the expense of the administration of charitable trusts.  The attorney general may suspend the filing of reports as to a particular charitable trust for a reasonable, specifically designated, time upon written application of the trustee filed with the attorney general and after the attorney general has filed in the register of charitable trusts a written statement that the interests of the beneficiaries will not be prejudiced thereby and that periodic reports are not required for proper supervision by his office.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. Any charitable organization with revenue, gains, and other support of $500,000 or more that is required to file an Internal Revenue Service Form 990 with the attorney general shall also submit the organization's latest financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Any charitable organization with revenue, gains, and other support of $1,000,000 or more that is required to file an Internal Revenue Service Form 990 with the attorney general shall also submit the organization's latest audited financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-c. Charitable organizations for which compliance with paragraphs III-a or III-b would constitute a financial burden may request an exemption according to criteria established and administered by the director of charitable trusts.  An exemption, if granted, shall be valid for 3 years from the date of issuance unless revoked by the director of charitable trusts and written notice of such revocation is provided to the charitable organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A copy of an account filed by the trustee in any court having jurisdiction of the trust or other relationship, if the account substantially complies with the rules and regulations of the attorney general, may be filed as a report required by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The first report for a trust or similar relationship hereafter established, unless the filing thereof is suspended as herein provided, shall be filed not later than 4 months and 15 days following the close of the first calendar or fiscal year in which any part of the income or principal is authorized or required to be applied to a charitable purpose and annually thereafter, unless excused by the attorney general under RSA 7:28, III.  If any part of the income or principal of a trust previously established is authorized or required to be applied to a charitable purpose at the time this act takes effect, the first report, unless the filing thereof is suspended, shall be filed within 6 months after the effective date of this act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Failure for 2 successive years to file a report shall, unless excused by the attorney general under RSA 7:28, III, constitute a breach of trust and the attorney general shall take such action as may be appropriate to compel compliance.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 7:32-c Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this subdivision is to ensure that health care charitable trusts provide the communities they serve with benefits in keeping with the charitable purposes for which the trusts were established and in recognition of the advantages the trusts enjoy.  It acknowledges that each community is unique and its particular health care problems and needs should be examined and the community benefits provided by health care charitable trusts which serve it should be directed toward addressing the issues and concerns of that community.  Community involvement in the development of community benefits plans is necessary to make the health care charitable trusts more responsive to the true needs of the community.  State oversight of the planning process and public access to the community benefits plans will assure appropriate use of the resources of health care charitable trusts.

The legislature finds that persons attempting to escape from actual or threatened domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault frequently establish new addresses in order to prevent their assailants or probable assailants from finding them.  The purpose of this program is to enable state and local agencies to respond to requests for public records without disclosing the location of a victim of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault, to enable interagency cooperation with the attorney general in providing address confidentiality for victims of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault, and to enable state and local agencies to accept a program participant's use of an address designated by the attorney general as a substitute mailing address.
