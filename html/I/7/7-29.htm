&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 7:29 Information From Clerk. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each clerk shall furnish such copies of papers and such information as to the records and files in his office relating to charitable trusts as the attorney general may require.  Such clerk shall also permit an examination of the files and records in the probate office by representatives of the attorney general for the purpose of establishing and maintaining said register of charitable trusts.  A refusal or neglect by the clerk so to send such copies or refuse such information or to refuse access to the probate records relating to charitable trusts shall be a breach of his official bond.  Upon the offering for probate in solemn form of any document purporting to be a will or testament containing clauses creating a charitable trust as defined herein, and upon presentation of any petition or other matter concerning a charitable trust and in all proceedings related thereto, the clerk shall seasonably notify the attorney general of the pendency thereof in advance of hearing thereon.  As soon as possible after the probate in common form of any will containing clauses creating a charitable trust, the clerk shall notify the attorney general thereof.  No charitable trust shall be terminated by decree of the probate court until the attorney general has been given an opportunity to be heard, if he so desires.
