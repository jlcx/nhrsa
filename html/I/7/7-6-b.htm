<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

II. No such communications common carrier nor any agent, servant, or employee thereof, shall be civilly or criminally responsible or liable for furnishing or delivering any records or information in compliance with said demand and the attorney general shall not disclose any information obtained as a result of said demand except as it is essential to the proper discharge of the attorney general's duties.  Any such written demand by the attorney general shall be understood to constitute an administrative subpoena for purposes of determining compliance with federal law.
