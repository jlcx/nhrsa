&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 7:41 Findings and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The legislature finds that persons attempting to escape from actual or threatened domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault frequently establish new addresses in order to prevent their assailants or probable assailants from finding them.  The purpose of this program is to enable state and local agencies to respond to requests for public records without disclosing the location of a victim of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault, to enable interagency cooperation with the attorney general in providing address confidentiality for victims of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault, and to enable state and local agencies to accept a program participant's use of an address designated by the attorney general as a substitute mailing address.
