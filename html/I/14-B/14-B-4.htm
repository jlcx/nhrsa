<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the committee concludes that the complaint is within its jurisdiction and has merit, then by recorded vote, the committee may conduct a preliminary investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Upon completion of its preliminary investigation, the committee shall conclude by recorded vote that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No action is appropriate because no improper conduct occurred;
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph VII(b) effective until December 7, 2016;  see also paragraph VII(b) set out below.]
</p>
</center>
<br>

</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The conduct complained of is of a serious nature and formal proceedings should be instituted to inquire further into the complaint.  The committee shall then make a statement of formal charges and hold a hearing on the complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Upon completion of the hearing, the committee shall conclude by recorded vote that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No action is appropriate because no improper conduct occurred;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No action is appropriate because there is not clear and convincing evidence that improper conduct occurred;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) There was improper conduct based upon clear and convincing evidence, but such conduct does not justify formal disciplinary action and should be resolved by informal methods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) There was improper conduct based upon clear and convincing evidence, and the improper conduct was of a serious nature so as to warrant formal disciplinary action by the general court in the case of a legislator or officer of the legislature, or formal disciplinary action by the joint committee on legislative facilities in the case of an employee of the legislature, except in the case of an employee of the legislature employed by the legislative budget assistant, in which case the formal disciplinary action shall be taken by the fiscal committee of the general court.  The committee shall submit to the speaker of the house and senate president in the case of a legislator or officer of the legislature, to the joint committee on legislative facilities in the case of an employee of the legislature, or to the fiscal committee of the general court in the case of an employee of the legislature employed by the legislative budget assistant, a summary report of the deliberations regarding the complaint and of its findings.  The report shall contain any specific recommendations concerning disciplinary actions to be imposed. With respect to any recommendations for disciplinary actions against a legislator, the committee may recommend one or more of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Reprimand.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Censure.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Denial or limitation of any right, power, privilege, or immunity of the legislator that the constitution of New Hampshire permits the general court to deny or limit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Before any disciplinary action may be taken against a legislator or against an officer of the legislature, the report shall be ratified by the legislator's or by the officer's respective body of the general court. Such ratification need not occur during the biennium in which the complaint was submitted, but may be considered and acted upon by the general court in the next succeeding session;  provided that no action shall be taken against an individual who is no longer a member of the general court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In a case involving an employee of the legislature, the joint committee on legislative facilities shall determine what disciplinary action shall be taken against the employee.  In a case involving an employee of the legislature who is employed by the legislative budget assistant, the fiscal committee of the general court shall determine what disciplinary action shall be taken against the employee.  In making its determination, the joint committee on legislative facilities or the fiscal committee of the general court as appropriate may use any of the specific recommendations concerning disciplinary actions which are contained in the report which it receives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In processing complaints filed under this chapter, the committee shall have subpoena powers.  If the legislator, the officer, or the employee of the legislature refuses to participate in the proceedings, the committee may refer the complaint to the attorney general for appropriate action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Any member of the legislative ethics committee who is directly or indirectly involved in any complaint before the committee shall not participate in any proceedings regarding the complaint.  In the event that a member does not participate in a particular case, the appointing authority shall designate an alternate to serve on the committee for that case only.
