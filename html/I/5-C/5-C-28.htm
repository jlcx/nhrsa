I. A parent or legal guardian may request to rescind an affidavit of paternity from the clerk of the city or town where the birth occurred within 60 days of the filing of an affidavit of paternity unless an administrative or judicial proceeding related to the child results in an earlier date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Once the completed rescission of paternity form is filed, the clerk of the town or city shall remove the name of the father from the birth record and insert "not stated'' in the space provided for the father's name or, if the original birth record was filed prior to the completion of an affidavit of paternity, change the child's name on the birth record back to the name stated on the original record before the affidavit of paternity was filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. After the 60-day rescission period has passed, any challenge to the affidavit shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction.
