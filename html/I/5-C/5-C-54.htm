&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state registrar shall review each application certified by a clerk of a town or city to determine that the application meets the requirements of RSA 5-C:52 and the evidence submitted establishes the facts of the marriage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the application complies with the requirements of paragraph I, the state registrar shall approve the application by signing and dating it and shall file the application at the division.  The registrar shall return the documentary evidence to the applicant along with a certified copy of the delayed certificate of marriage and send a copy of the documents and the delayed certificate of marriage to the clerk of the town or city.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When an applicant does not submit the minimum acceptable documentation required for a delayed registration, or when the state registrar has cause to question the validity or adequacy of the applicant's sworn statement or the documentary evidence, the state registrar shall deny the application by not registering the delayed certificate.  The registrar shall notify the applicant of the denial in writing and request the additional documentary evidence to prove the facts of marriage.  The registrar shall advise the applicant of the reason for this action and of his or her right to appeal within 30 days to the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the state registrar is unable to approve an application because the documentary evidence does not comply paragraph I, the registrar shall notify the applicant and the clerk of the town or city of the denial within 10 days of receipt of the application and return the application to the clerk of the town or city.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the state registrar has denied the application, a clerk of the town or city shall contact the applicant to obtain the necessary evidence to meet the requirements, except that the state registrar shall dismiss an application for a delayed certificate of marriage that has not been completed within one year from the date of application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The state registrar shall send a copy of the letter of dismissal or denial to the clerk of the town or city where the alleged marriage license was issued.
