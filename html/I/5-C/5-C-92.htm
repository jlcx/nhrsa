I. Within 6 months of the filing of the marriage registration, corrections shall be made on the marriage record using the form indicated under RSA 5-C:85, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a person makes application to amend or correct a marriage record, the clerk of the city or town who issued the marriage license shall be paid the application fee required of the applicant by RSA 5-C:10, unless the correction is due to an error by the clerk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Other than minor corrections in spelling or clerical errors, name changes involving the name of a spouse as listed on a marriage certificate shall be made as follows:  a certified copy of the court order from a court of competent jurisdiction changing the name shall be obtained by the applicant;  the court order shall be presented to the clerk of the town or city who issued the marriage license;  the name change shall be shown with the notation A.K.A.;  there shall be a notation on the marriage record which shall show the name of the court and the date of the court order;  and shall be in accordance with RSA 5-C:90.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When an applicant does not submit documentation to substantiate the need to amend a marriage record, or when the state registrar has reasonable cause to question the validity or adequacy of the applicant's sworn statements or the documentary evidence, the state registrar shall notify the applicant, in writing of the deficiencies in the application.  The state registrar shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the vital record shall not be amended unless the deficiencies are corrected and that the applicant has the right to appeal the registrar's decision within 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The correction process as described above shall not apply to public records under RSA 5-C:105 unless it is shown that such a record is to be used for legal purposes or the registrant is still alive.
