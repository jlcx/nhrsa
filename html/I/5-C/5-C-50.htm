<codesect>
The clerk of the town or city shall refer to the state registrar all requests for a marriage license made by parties who are currently married but the validity of the marriage is questioned by the court, law enforcement agencies or the state registrars outside of New Hampshire.  If the validity of a marriage is questioned, the clerk of the town or city shall obtain from the licensees any documentation of their current marriage, including, but not limited to, a copy of a marriage license or the certified copy of a final divorce decree, and forward all the information to the division for a review by the state registrar.  If a review of the documentation provides sufficient evidence that the marriage in question is subject to challenge, the state registrar shall notify in writing the married couple and the clerk of the town or city.  The couple may petition the court for a review of the legal status of the marriage or the couple may initiate the application for a marriage license.
