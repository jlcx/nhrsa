&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 5-C:24 Affidavit of Paternity. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of a child born in the state of New Hampshire whose paternity has not been established by means of an affidavit of paternity, the mother or the natural father may initiate a request for an acknowledgment of paternity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The affidavit of paternity shall be completed and filed in accordance with RSA 5-C:25.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A hospital shall attempt to have the affidavit of paternity completed in the hospital, but if an affidavit is not completed before the birth record is sent to the division and the paternity is not yet established, then the phrase "not stated'' shall be inserted for the father's name.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the affidavit of paternity is not completed in the hospital, the mother and natural father shall contact the clerk of the town or city to execute the affidavit of paternity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The natural father's name, date of birth, and state of birth shall be added to the birth record by the clerk of the town or city upon the registrar's receipt of a sworn, notarized affidavit of paternity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A copy of the completed affidavit of paternity shall be forwarded by the hospital to the department of health and human services, division of child support services and the original to the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the mother or natural father is not of legal age, then each signature on the affidavit of paternity form of a person under the age of 18 shall be accompanied by the signature of his or her parent or legal guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. When an affidavit of paternity is executed after the death of a child, a notation shall be made on the affidavit indicating that the child is deceased and that the changes authorized on the birth record are also applicable to the death record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. When the married mother of a child born in a hospital indicates that her husband is not the natural father of the child but because of time constraints a 3-party affidavit of paternity cannot be executed before she leaves the hospital, the surname of the child shall be any name chosen by the mother and the hospital shall enter "not stated'' on the birth record for all information pertaining to the father of the child.  The mother, natural father, and husband shall subsequently sign a 3-party affidavit of paternity form, with each signature notarized, and submit it to the clerk of the city or town where the birth occurred.  Upon receipt of the signed and notarized 3-party affidavit of paternity, the clerk shall create a new birth record for the child, reflecting the new name of the child as well as the natural father's information.  The natural father may sign the affidavit before the birth of the child has occurred, but the mother's signature shall not be affixed to the affidavit form until after the birth of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. When an unwed mother applies to the clerk of a town or city wishing to add the name of a father to her child's birth record the following shall apply:  the affidavit of paternity shall be executed prior to the child's 18th birthday;  the natural father to be named shall personally sign the affidavit;  if signed separately, each signature shall be separately notarized;  in those cases where the alleged natural father is deceased, the mother shall present her request in the form of petition to a court of competent jurisdiction;  and, if the court approves the request, the resulting court order shall be processed by the clerk of the town or city in the same manner as a court determination of paternity and in accordance with RSA 5-C:26.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Once the surname of the child has been established through an executed affidavit of paternity, any subsequent change shall be made upon receipt of a certified copy of a legal change of name issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon receipt of a notice of adoption from the probate court, the clerk of the town or city of birth occurrence shall immediately process a new birth record and, within 2 weeks, forward a copy to the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon receipt by the division of a notice of adoption in New Hampshire for a child born out-of-state the division shall send notice of the adoption to the vital records agency of the state of birth so that the birth record in that state can be amended and, if the adoption notice received by the division contains inaccurate or missing information, the state registrar shall return the notice to the court issuing the adoption decree via the applicable state's vital records agency asking for necessary corrections.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 5-C:33 Procedure for Amending the Birth Record Following Adoption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When the clerk of the town or city of birth occurrence receives a notice of adoption, a new birth record shall be prepared as specified in RSA 5-C:31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The new birth record shall be substituted immediately for the original birth record by the clerk of the town or city.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The original birth record and the notice of adoption shall not be subject to inspection except pursuant to RSA 5-C:9 or upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to RSA 170-B:23.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The actual place and date of birth shall be shown on the new birth record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If no original birth record is on file for the adoptee the clerk of the town or city shall prepare a new birth record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the date and place of birth have not been determined in the adoption proceedings, a delayed certificate of birth shall be filed with the state registrar as provided in RSA 5-C:38 through RSA 5-C:40 before a new certificate of birth is prepared and, if the required evidence cannot be obtained that would justify the creation of a delayed certificate of birth, the registrar shall authorize the preparation of a birth certificate for the adoptee using court records as the authority for approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In the case of a single parent adoption, the information concerning the other parent shall be listed as "not stated.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In the case of an adopting parent whose spouse is deceased, upon written request of the adopting parent, the clerk of the town or city shall include the information about the husband when his date of death is not more than 9 months prior to the adoptee's birth and information on the wife shall be included when her date of death is after the adoptee's date of birth.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. When a new birth record following an adoption is prepared by the clerk of the town or city of birth occurrence, no copy of the original birth certificate in the state of New Hampshire shall be disclosed except pursuant to RSA 5-C:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. When the adoption concerns a child who had been born at home, the clerk of the town or city of birth occurrence shall minimize disclosure of information that would provide a possible connection with the natural mother by recording only the city or town of birth and not the street address on the new birth record;  and, if the name of the natural mother is shown on the original birth record as the certifier, informant or attendant, replacing it with the adoptive mother's name on the new birth record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. When it has been determined by the division that an adoption had previously been decreed by an authorized court, including out-of-state courts, but the amended birth record had not been prepared at the time of the adoption, then the clerk of the city or town of birth occurrence shall immediately prepare a new birth record and the division shall contact the court that authorized the adoption and ask that a certified copy of the adoption decree be prepared and transmitted to the city or town of birth with a copy sent to the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Upon receipt of a report of decree of annulment of adoption, the clerk of the town or city of birth occurrence shall replace the amended birth record with the original.  The previous amended birth record and evidence shall not be subject to inspection except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to RSA 170-B:23.

II. The state registrar shall send a letter via certified mail to the accused stating the alleged facts and requesting documentation to prove the marriage certificate in question is valid and dispute the claim of bigamy such as, but not limited to a certified copy of a final divorce or civil annulment of the previous marriage or a death certificate of the spouse from the previous marriage.  If the division does not receive a response to the certified letter within 30 days of the signed receipt of the letter, the state registrar shall inform the person making the initial allegation of the lack of response and the need to refer the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction.  Upon receipt of the evidence submitted by the accused, the state registrar shall determine whether the validity of the marriage certificate is in question.  If the evidence submitted shows that the validity of the marriage certificate is not in question, then the state registrar shall send a certified letter to the accused with the results of the investigation and a copy of the letter to the person making the allegation and the clerk of the town or city.  If the evidence submitted shows that the validity of the marriage certificate is in question, then the state registrar shall send a certified letter, indicating the results of the investigation and that the marriage certificate shall be voided, to the accused, the person making the allegation, and the clerk, and the county attorney.  In the case where the accused disputes the determination of the state registrar, the accused may request, within 30 days, an administrative hearing.

The form shall be completed by the clerk of the town or city with the following:  an indication of the type of vital record, whether the correction is being done in order to enact a legal change of name, correct a state or town record which contains incorrect information, or make a correction due to spelling or other typographical errors;  the items to be corrected;  the items as they now appear on the record;  the items as they should appear on the record after the correction is made;  the date of the vital record event;  information sufficient to identify the person requesting the correction;  the source for the correction;  the date the original vital record was filed with the clerk of the town or city;  and the clerk's signature, town or city name, and date the clerk of the town or city signed the form.  The form shall be forwarded to the division upon completion in order to have the correction made to the state record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A second form shall be used if corrections to a vital record are to be made more than 6 months after the filing of the birth, marriage, or death.  The form shall be completed by the clerk of the town or city with the following:  an indication of the type of vital record;  the items to be corrected;  the items as they now appear on the record;  the items as they should appear on the record after the correction is made;  the date of the vital record event;  the name and address of the person requesting the correction;  the birthplace of the person requesting the correction;  a list of evidence presented indicating the type of documentation presented by the requestor;  and the signature of the clerk of the town or city and date signed by month, day, and year.  The form shall be signed by the person requesting the correction and shall be notarized by a notary public or justice of the peace.  The clerk of the town or city shall submit the form to the state registrar along with a copy of the supporting documentation.  The state registrar shall review the documentation for completeness and indicate approval or disapproval of the requested changes in accordance with RSA 5-C:40 for birth records, RSA 5-C:54 for marriage records, and RSA 5-C:94 for death records.
