&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In those cases in which personal data concerning the deceased is not available or it is not possible to obtain the cause of death information within the 36 hours stipulated for obtaining the burial permit, the funeral director, next of kin, or designated agent shall request that an emergency burial permit be issued.  The request shall be submitted to the division and accompanied by the incomplete death record.  The request shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The full name of the deceased.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The date and place of death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The place the body will be stored, if applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The method and place of final disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An explanation of the emergency condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The name of the funeral director, next of kin, or designated agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The license number of the funeral director, if applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The current date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The funeral director, next of kin, or designated agent shall supply the missing data to the division within 6 calendar days of the date of death.  If the funeral director, next of kin, or designated agent is unable to supply the missing information within 6 calendar days, he or she shall request a further extension.  The request for a further extension shall be in writing and contain an explanation as to why a further extension is necessary.  An additional 6 calendar day extension may be granted by the state registrar.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The use of the emergency process for obtaining a burial permit shall be restricted to New Hampshire licensed funeral directors, the next of kin, or the designated agent of the deceased.  If a New Hampshire licensed funeral director is acting to assist an out-of-state funeral director in obtaining a burial permit that will involve removal of the body from the state of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire funeral director shall process a burial permit as outlined in RSA 5-C:67 through RSA 5-C:73.
