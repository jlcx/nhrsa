&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 15:5 Prohibited Activities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, no recipient of a grant or appropriation of state funds may use the state funds to lobby or attempt to influence legislation, participate in political activity, or contribute funds to any entity engaged in these activities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any recipient of a grant or appropriation of state funds that wishes to engage in any of the activities prohibited in paragraph I, or contribute funds to any entity engaged in these activities, shall segregate the state funds in such a manner that such funds are physically and financially separate from any non-state funds that may be used for any of these purposes.  Mere bookkeeping separation of the state funds from other moneys shall not be sufficient.
