&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 5-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the establishment of pooled risk management programs and to affirm the status of such programs established for the benefit of political subdivisions of the state.  The legislature finds and determines that insurance and risk management is essential to the proper functioning of political subdivisions;  that risk management can be achieved through purchase of traditional insurance or by participation in pooled risk management programs established for the benefit of political subdivisions;  that pooled risk management is an essential governmental function by providing focused public sector loss prevention programs, accrual of interest and dividend earnings which may be returned to the public benefit and establishment of costs predicated solely on the actual experience of political subdivisions within the state;  that the resources of political subdivisions are presently burdened by the securing of insurance protection through standard carriers;  and that pooled risk management programs which meet the standards established by this chapter should not be subject to insurance regulation and taxation by the state.
