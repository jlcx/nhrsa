&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-J:14-h Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that the encouragement and support of the establishment of multi-jurisdictional assessing districts is in the state's interest in order to ensure the accuracy and fairness of valuations of real property for the purposes of administration of the education tax, county property taxes, school district property taxes, municipal property taxes, the distribution of various forms of state aid, and the equalization of property values among jurisdictions.  The general court further recognizes that many municipalities do not have sufficient numbers of real estate parcels, sufficient varieties of real property, or sufficient levels of new development to make it practical or economical to engage full-time, trained, and certified assessing professionals.  The general court further finds that the state has a vested interest in encouraging and supporting the establishment of cooperative assessing districts which can efficiently and economically provide full-time, trained, and certified assessing professionals to serve the municipalities which elect to create and join said districts.
