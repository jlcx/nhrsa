<codesect>
All reasonable expenses incurred by the department in conducting an audit shall be paid in the first instance from the appropriation for the department, but each county, city, town, school district, village district or precinct shall, upon notification by the commissioner of the amount due, reimburse it for such reasonable expenses as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each county and city shall make reimbursement for all such reasonable expenses including salaries of members of the department for such time as said members have spent in said audit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
