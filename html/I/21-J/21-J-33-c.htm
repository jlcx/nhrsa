(a) Aids or assists in, procures, or advises with respect to, the preparation or presentation of any portion of a return, affidavit, claim, or other document in connection with any matter arising under statutes and rules administered by the department;  and

(b) Knows that such portion will be used in connection with any material matter arising under statutes and rules administered by the department;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Knows that such portion, if so used, will result in an understatement of liability for tax of another person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(a) The term "procures'' shall mean ordering or causing a subordinate to do an act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The term "subordinate'' includes any other person over whose activities the person has direction, supervision or control, whether or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The term "understatement of liability'' means any understatement of the net amount payable with respect to any tax imposed or any overstatement of the net amount creditable or refundable with respect to any such tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A person furnishing typing, reproducing or other mechanical assistance shall not be treated as having aided or assisted in the preparation of any portion of a return, affidavit, claim, or other document.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This penalty shall apply whether or not the understatement is with the knowledge or consent of the persons authorized or required to present the return, affidavit, claim or other document.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner shall have the authority under this chapter and RSA 80 to administer and enforce this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
