&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-J:9-a Equalization Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following procedures shall apply in determining the equalization of property within the cities, towns, and unincorporated places as required by RSA 21-J:3, XIII, but shall not affect a municipality's requirements for inventory of property and assessment of taxes as of April 1:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall annually conduct a sales-assessment ratio study which shall include arm's length sales or transfers of property that occurred 6 months prior to and 6 months following April 1 of the tax year for which such equalization is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining the arm's length sales or transfers that are included in the sales-assessment ratio study, the commissioner may use a randomly selected sample of such sales and transfers the size of which shall be determined by the total taxable parcels in the city, town, or unincorporated place.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If less than 2 percent of the total taxable parcels in a city, town, or unincorporated place has been transferred by an arm's length sale or transfer during the 6 months prior to and 6 months following April 1 of the tax year for which such equalization is made or the commissioner determines the sales are unrepresentative of the property within the municipality, the commissioner may choose one or more of the following options:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Include appraisals of any of the taxable property of such city, town, or unincorporated place in the sales-assessment ratio study.  Such appraisals shall be based on full and true value pursuant to RSA 75:1 and shall be performed by department appraisers.  The property to be appraised shall be selected by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Include arm's length sales or transfers in the city, town, or unincorporated place, within 2- 1/2 years preceding April 1 of the year preceding the tax year for which such equalization is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Consider recent equalization ratio activity in adjoining cities, towns, or unincorporated places.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may use the inventory of property transfers authorized by RSA 74:18 in determining the equalized value of property and may consider such other evidence as may be available to the commissioner on or before the time the final equalized value is determined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A report filed by the assessing officials of each city, town, and unincorporated place shall certify sales-assessment information necessary for the commissioner to conduct the annual sales-assessment ratio study required under paragraph I. This report shall be filed within 45 days after receipt from the commissioner.  Municipalities which fail to timely file the report due to willful neglect or intentional disregard of laws or rules and not reasonable cause shall pay a penalty to the state in the amount of $100 for each day that the report is not timely filed.  Within 30 days after the imposition of the penalty by the commissioner, officials of the city, town, or unincorporated place upon which the penalty was imposed may appeal by written application to the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court in the county in which the city, town, or unincorporated place is located.  The board of tax and land appeals or the superior court, as the case may be, shall determine de novo the correctness of the commissioner's actions.

<center><h3>Section 21-J:14-h</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-J:14-h Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that the encouragement and support of the establishment of multi-jurisdictional assessing districts is in the state's interest in order to ensure the accuracy and fairness of valuations of real property for the purposes of administration of the education tax, county property taxes, school district property taxes, municipal property taxes, the distribution of various forms of state aid, and the equalization of property values among jurisdictions.  The general court further recognizes that many municipalities do not have sufficient numbers of real estate parcels, sufficient varieties of real property, or sufficient levels of new development to make it practical or economical to engage full-time, trained, and certified assessing professionals.  The general court further finds that the state has a vested interest in encouraging and supporting the establishment of cooperative assessing districts which can efficiently and economically provide full-time, trained, and certified assessing professionals to serve the municipalities which elect to create and join said districts.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For all taxes administered by the department, interest on amounts not paid when due shall be computed at the annual underpayment rate determined from time to time pursuant to paragraph II from the prescribed payment date or original statutory due date to the date payment is actually made.  Interest shall be allowed and paid at the annual overpayment rate determined from time to time pursuant to paragraph III upon any overpayment of taxes administered by the department.  No interest shall be allowed or paid on amounts less than $10 unless specifically requested in writing.  If any overpayment of tax administered by the department is refunded within 3 months after the due date or authorized extension date or within 3 months after the return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed under this section.  Interest on amounts not paid when due, or interest on overpayments shall be equal to the sum of the simple interest amounts computed with respect to each calendar year, or a portion thereof, during which the underpayment or overpayment remains outstanding.  Interest with respect to only a portion of a calendar year shall be determined on a pro rata basis based on the number of days the underpayment or overpayment remains outstanding during the 365-day calendar year.  Upon certification by the commissioner, the state treasurer shall refund the overpayment with interest from the revenue of the specific tax.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After a claim for refund is filed, the department shall examine it and either issue a notice of refund or credit to the claimant or issue a notice of denial.  After receipt of the department's decision, the claimant may file a written petition for reconsideration with the department as provided in RSA 21-J:28-b.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. With respect to any refund claim filed with the department pursuant to this section, the commissioner and the taxpayer may, in writing, agree to extend the time for action upon such claim for refund.

The department shall notify the taxpayer in the event of any such offset in tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In all cases where it appears that a taxpayer has overpaid his or her tax and the overpayment is $10 or less, the department may, in its discretion, disregard the overpayment if the cost to the state to refund the overpayment would exceed the amount involved, unless the taxpayer has requested the refund.

The preparation of a substantial portion of a return or claim for refund shall be treated as if it were the preparation of such return or claim for refund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A person shall not be a "tax preparer'' for purposes of this section merely because such person:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance;
<br>

(b) Prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer, or of an officer or employee of the employer, by whom he is regularly and continuously employed;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

VI. If at any time there is a final administrative determination or a final judicial decision that there was no understatement of liability in the case of any return or claim for refund with respect to which a penalty under this section has been assessed, such assessment shall be abated, and if any portion of such penalty has been paid the amount so paid shall be refunded to the person who made such payment as an overpayment of tax without regard to any period of limitation which would apply to the making of such refund.
