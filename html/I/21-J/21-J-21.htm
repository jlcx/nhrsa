&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-J:21 Publication of Report of Audit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A written or printed report of every completed audit shall be made to the proper local officials including a summary of the findings and recommendations of the auditors and a copy of such summary shall be published in the next annual report following the fiscal year in which the audit was completed.  If, in the opinion of the governing board of a city or the selectmen, school board, county or village district commissioners, the whole report of audit should be published, the report may be published.  If such summary of findings and recommendations is not so published, the commissioner, at the expense of the county, city, town, or district affected thereby, may cause such summary to be separately published and distributed or published in a newspaper having a general circulation in said county, city, town, or district.
