&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 regulates the deployment of wireless services in the United States.  Its purpose is to make these services available to the American people quickly and in a very competitive manner.  Nothing in this chapter is intended to preempt the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The visual effects of tall antenna mounts or towers may go well beyond the physical borders between municipalities, and should be addressed so as to require that all affected parties have the opportunity to be heard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Carriers wishing to build personal wireless service facilities (PWSFs) in New Hampshire should consider commercially available alternative PWSFs to tall cellular towers, which may include the use of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Lower antenna mounts which do not protrude as far above the surrounding tree canopies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Disguised PWSFs such as flagpoles, artificial tree poles, light poles, and traffic lights, which blend in with their surroundings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Camouflaged PWSFs mounted on existing structures and buildings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Custom designed PWSFs to minimize the visual impact of a PWSF on its surroundings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Other available technology.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A PWSF map is necessary to allow for the orderly and efficient deployment of wireless communication services in New Hampshire, and so that local communities have adequate information with which to consider appropriate siting and options to mitigate the visual effects of PWSFs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Municipalities will benefit from state guidance regarding provisions to be considered in zoning ordinances relative to the deployment of wireless communications facilities, including one or more model ordinances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. It is the policy of this state to facilitate the provision of broadband and other advanced personal wireless services across the state;  and to promote access to broadband and advanced personal wireless services for all residents, students, government agencies, and businesses to ensure the availability of educational opportunities, economic development, and public safety services throughout New Hampshire.  Deployment of personal wireless service facilities infrastructure is also critical to ensuring that first responders can provide for the health and safety of all residents of New Hampshire.
