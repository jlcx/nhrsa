&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-K:10 Application Review. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any ordinance, bylaw, or regulation to the contrary, in order to ensure uniformity across New Hampshire with respect to the process for reviewing a collocation application and a modification application, each authority shall follow the following process:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Collocation applications and modification applications shall be reviewed for conformance with applicable building permit requirements but shall not otherwise be subject to zoning or land use requirements, including design or placement requirements, or public hearing review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority, within 45 calendar days of receiving a collocation application or modification application, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Review the collocation application or modification application in light of its conformity with applicable building permit requirements and consistency with this chapter.  A collocation application or modification application is deemed to be complete unless the authority notifies the applicant in writing, within 15 calendar days of submission of the specific deficiencies in the collocation application or modification application which, if cured, would make the collocation application or modification application complete.  Upon receipt of a timely written notice that a collocation application or modification application is deficient, an applicant shall have 15 calendar days from receiving such notice to cure the specific deficiencies.  If the applicant cures the deficiencies within 15 calendar days, the collocation application or modification application shall be reviewed and processed within 45 calendar days from the initial date received by the authority.  If the applicant requires more than 15 calendar days to cure the specific deficiencies, the 45 calendar days deadline for review shall be extended by the same period of time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Make its final decision to approve or disapprove the collocation application or modification application;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Advise the applicant in writing of its final decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the authority fails to act on a collocation application or modification application within the 45 calendar days review period, the collocation application or modification application shall be deemed approved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, an authority may not mandate, require or regulate the installation, location, or use of PWSFs on utility poles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A party aggrieved by the final action of an authority, either by an affirmative denial of a collocation application or modification application under paragraph II or by its inaction, may bring an action for review in superior court for the county in which the PWSF is situated.
