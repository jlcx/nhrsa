&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Applicant'' means a carrier or any person engaged in the business of providing the infrastructure required for a PWSF who submits a collocation application or a modification application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Authority'' means each state, county, and each governing body, board, agency, office, or commission of a municipality authorized by law to make legislative, quasi judicial, or administrative decisions relative to the construction, installation, modification, or siting of PWSFs and mounts.  The term shall not include state courts having jurisdiction over land use, planning, or zoning decisions made by an authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Average tree canopy height'' means the average height found by inventorying the height above ground level of all trees over a specified height within a specified radius.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Base station'' means a station at the base of a mount or in the area near the PWSF that is authorized to communicate with mobile stations, generally consisting of radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial cables, power supplies, and other associated electronics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Building permit'' means a permit issued pursuant to RSA 676 by an authority prior to the collocation or modification of PWSFs, solely to ensure that the work to be performed by the applicant satisfies the applicable building code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Camouflaged'' means for a personal wireless service facility one that is disguised, hidden, part of an existing or proposed structure, or placed within an existing or proposed structure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. "Carrier'' means a person that provides personal wireless services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. "Collocation'' means the placement or installation of new PWSFs on existing towers or mounts, including electrical transmission towers and water towers, as well as existing buildings and other structures capable of structurally supporting the attachment of PWSFs in compliance with applicable codes.  "Collocation'' does not include a "substantial modification.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. "Collocation application'' shall mean a request submitted by an applicant to an authority for collocation on a tower or mount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. "Director'' means the director of the office of energy and planning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. "Disguised'' means, for a PWSF, designed to look like a structure which may commonly be found in the area surrounding a proposed PWSF such as, but not limited to, flagpoles, light poles, traffic lights, or artificial tree poles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. "Electrical transmission tower'' means an electrical transmission structure used to support high voltage overhead power lines.  The term shall not include any utility pole.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. "Equipment compound'' means an area surrounding or near the base of a tower or mount supporting a PWSF, and encompassing all equipment shelters, cabinets, generators, and appurtenances primarily associated with the PWSF.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. "Equipment shelter'' means an enclosed structure, cabinet, shed vault, or box near the base of a mount within which are housed equipment for PWSFs, such as batteries and electrical equipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. "Height'' means the height above ground level from the natural grade of a site to the highest point of a structure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. "Modification'' means the replacement or alteration of an existing PWSF within a previously approved equipment compound or upon a previously approved mount.  Routine maintenance of an approved PWSF shall not be considered a modification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIX. "Modification application'' means a request submitted by an applicant to an authority for modification of a PWSF.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XX. "Mount'' means the structure or surface upon which antennas are mounted and includes roof-mounted, side-mounted, ground-mounted, and structure-mounted antennas on an existing building, as well as an electrical transmission tower and water tower, and excluding utility poles.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Increases or results in the increase of the permitted vertical height of a tower, or the existing vertical height of a mount, by either more than 10 percent or the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Involves adding an appurtenance to the body of a tower or mount that protrudes horizontally from the edge of the tower or mount more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower or mount at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater, except where necessary to shelter the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the antenna to the tower or mount via cable;  or
