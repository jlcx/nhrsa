<center><h2>CHAPTER 12-K<br>DEPLOYMENT OF PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES</h2></center>
<center><h3>Section 12-K:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-K:1 Goals;  Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 regulates the deployment of wireless services in the United States.  Its purpose is to make these services available to the American people quickly and in a very competitive manner.  Nothing in this chapter is intended to preempt the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The visual effects of tall antenna mounts or towers may go well beyond the physical borders between municipalities, and should be addressed so as to require that all affected parties have the opportunity to be heard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Carriers wishing to build personal wireless service facilities (PWSFs) in New Hampshire should consider commercially available alternative PWSFs to tall cellular towers, which may include the use of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Lower antenna mounts which do not protrude as far above the surrounding tree canopies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Disguised PWSFs such as flagpoles, artificial tree poles, light poles, and traffic lights, which blend in with their surroundings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Camouflaged PWSFs mounted on existing structures and buildings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Custom designed PWSFs to minimize the visual impact of a PWSF on its surroundings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Other available technology.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A PWSF map is necessary to allow for the orderly and efficient deployment of wireless communication services in New Hampshire, and so that local communities have adequate information with which to consider appropriate siting and options to mitigate the visual effects of PWSFs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Municipalities will benefit from state guidance regarding provisions to be considered in zoning ordinances relative to the deployment of wireless communications facilities, including one or more model ordinances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. It is the policy of this state to facilitate the provision of broadband and other advanced personal wireless services across the state;  and to promote access to broadband and advanced personal wireless services for all residents, students, government agencies, and businesses to ensure the availability of educational opportunities, economic development, and public safety services throughout New Hampshire.  Deployment of personal wireless service facilities infrastructure is also critical to ensuring that first responders can provide for the health and safety of all residents of New Hampshire.  Consistent with the federal Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Public Law 112-96, section 6409, which creates a national wireless emergency communications network for use by first responders that will be dependent on facilities placed on existing antenna mounts or towers, it is the policy of this state to facilitate the collocation of personal wireless services facilities on existing antenna mounts or towers in all areas of New Hampshire, while also allowing for expeditious modification of existing personal wireless service facilities to keep pace with technological improvements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Except as provided in RSA 12-K:10 and RSA 12-K:11, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as altering any municipal zoning ordinance, and this chapter itself shall not be construed as a zoning ordinance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 12-K:10 Application Review. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any ordinance, bylaw, or regulation to the contrary, in order to ensure uniformity across New Hampshire with respect to the process for reviewing a collocation application and a modification application, each authority shall follow the following process:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Collocation applications and modification applications shall be reviewed for conformance with applicable building permit requirements but shall not otherwise be subject to zoning or land use requirements, including design or placement requirements, or public hearing review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority, within 45 calendar days of receiving a collocation application or modification application, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Review the collocation application or modification application in light of its conformity with applicable building permit requirements and consistency with this chapter.  A collocation application or modification application is deemed to be complete unless the authority notifies the applicant in writing, within 15 calendar days of submission of the specific deficiencies in the collocation application or modification application which, if cured, would make the collocation application or modification application complete.  Upon receipt of a timely written notice that a collocation application or modification application is deficient, an applicant shall have 15 calendar days from receiving such notice to cure the specific deficiencies.  If the applicant cures the deficiencies within 15 calendar days, the collocation application or modification application shall be reviewed and processed within 45 calendar days from the initial date received by the authority.  If the applicant requires more than 15 calendar days to cure the specific deficiencies, the 45 calendar days deadline for review shall be extended by the same period of time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Make its final decision to approve or disapprove the collocation application or modification application;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Advise the applicant in writing of its final decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the authority fails to act on a collocation application or modification application within the 45 calendar days review period, the collocation application or modification application shall be deemed approved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, an authority may not mandate, require or regulate the installation, location, or use of PWSFs on utility poles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A party aggrieved by the final action of an authority, either by an affirmative denial of a collocation application or modification application under paragraph II or by its inaction, may bring an action for review in superior court for the county in which the PWSF is situated.
