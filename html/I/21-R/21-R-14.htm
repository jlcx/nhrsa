<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall develop a statewide information policy based on the following principles of open government data.  According to these principles, open data is data that is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Complete.  All public data is made available, unless subject to valid privacy, security, or privilege limitations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Primary.  Data is collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, rather than in aggregate or modified forms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Timely.  Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Accessible.  Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Machine processable.  Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Nondiscriminatory.  Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Nonproprietary.  Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control, with the exception of national or international published standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) License-free.  Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret regulation.  Reasonable privacy, security, and privilege restrictions may be allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The information policy developed under paragraph I shall include a mechanism for adoption and review by each state agency.  Each agency that adopts the policy shall designate a contact person responsible for oversight and implementation of open government data standards for that agency.  The contact shall act as a liaison between the department, the implementing agency, and the public in matters related to open government data standards.  The commissioner shall include the status of the development and implementation of the statewide information policy based on open government data standards in the quarterly report to the legislative oversight committee under RSA 21-R:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In developing the open data standards policy, the commissioner shall solicit information from the secretary of state relative to state archiving practices and the collection of data for historical purposes.
