&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall assist state agencies in the purchase or creation of data processing devices or systems that comply with open standards for the accessing, storing, or transferring of data.  The commissioner shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Ensure that any new data standards which the state of New Hampshire defines and to which it owns all rights are open standards compliant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Use open standards unless specific project requirements preclude use of an open data format.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Reexamine existing data stored in a restricted format to which the state of New Hampshire does not own the rights every 4 years to determine if the format has become open and, if not, whether an appropriate open standard exists.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Make readily accessible, on the state website, documentation on open data formats used by the state of New Hampshire.  When data in open format is made available through the state's website, a link shall be provided to the corresponding data format documentation.
