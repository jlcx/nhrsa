<center><h3>Section 21-K:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 21-K:1 Finding;  Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that the state library, commission on the arts, and historic preservation office, in existence prior to the effective date of this chapter, and all of which currently function separately, are inextricably linked because they are ultimately and fundamentally engaged in pursuits which are cultural in nature, and deserve increased visibility and recognition within state government.  Therefore, in recognition of its duty under Part 2, Article 83 of the state constitution to cherish the interest of literature, and to encourage public institutions for the promotion of arts and sciences, the general court enacts this chapter creating a department of cultural resources.  The general court intends by this action to provide for the general welfare of the citizens of the state by recognizing the essential nature of pursuits which broaden our minds and spirits and preserve our history and culture for future generations.  Combining state government functions of collecting, cataloguing, and making available all manner of books and other information;  encouraging and assisting the development of the arts;  and preserving historical, archaeological, architectural, and cultural heritage, is intended to enhance and strengthen the role of cultural arms of state government.  The general court intends that a single, strong, visible cultural agency shall assume equal status with other major departments of state government.
