III. The bureau shall be further responsible for coordinating efforts in obtaining easements and rights-of-way, in establishing trails and trail facilities, and any other similarly related tasks that may be required as a responsibility of the department of resources and economic development in relation to snowmobiles and OHRVs.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The bureau shall also have the responsibility to make or participate in a continuing study on the effects of snowmobile and OHRV operations on erosion and other damage to the environment.  If other state agencies are involved in an overall study of this nature, the bureau shall cooperate with such agencies, and maintain a record of all findings that pertain to snowmobiles.
<br>
