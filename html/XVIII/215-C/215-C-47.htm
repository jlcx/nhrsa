&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A snowmobile which is registered in Vermont, Maine, or Quebec shall be deemed to be properly registered for the purposes of this chapter if it is registered in accordance with the laws of the state or province in which it is registered, but only to the extent that a reciprocal exemption or privilege is granted under the laws of that state or province for snowmobiles registered in this state.  For the purpose of this section, the executive director shall determine the extent of the privilege of operation granted by Vermont, Maine, and Quebec and, when necessary, adopt rules and charge fees to achieve a true reciprocity.  The executive director's determination shall be final.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In order to operate any snowmobile granted reciprocity under paragraph I, such vehicle shall meet all equipment requirements and sound level decibel limitations which are mandated by RSA 215-C for snowmobiles registered in New Hampshire.
