VI. The chief supervisor of the bureau may make recommendations concerning RSA 215-C:3 and such rules as the chief supervisor feels may be necessary for the use and control of snowmobile trails, facilities, and lands under bureau control or lease to the commissioner of the department of resources and economic development.  The commissioner may adopt such recommendations as rules as provided in RSA 215-C:3.

IX. The bureau may make application to the commissioner of transportation for a permit in writing to allow snowmobiles to operate on or across certain bridges of class I, II, and III highways when such operation is necessary for gaining access to established trails or to events being developed or held in conjunction with established snowmobile club activities.  The commissioner of transportation may issue or deny such permits.  A permit shall specify the type of snowmobiles to be allowed, the permitted dates and hours of operation, and shall require the bureau to erect and maintain all signs required under the terms of the permit.  Any person operating a snowmobile on or across a bridge under this paragraph shall do so at his or her own risk.  Said person shall keep to the extreme right side of the bridge and shall yield to all oncoming vehicular traffic.

Operators of snowmobiles using said roads, or portions thereof, shall keep to the extreme right and shall yield to all conventional motor vehicle traffic.  The bureau, or its designee, shall so post such highways where authorized.  Following a duly noticed public hearing, except in the case of an emergency closure, such city or town authorities may change the allowable usage of a class IV, class V, or class VI highway by snowmobiles by giving notification to the supervisor of the bureau and removing any signs that no longer apply.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. In those instances where a municipality does not maintain a class IV, class V, or class VI highway for winter use by conventional motor vehicles, the city or town council or board of selectmen may authorize the use of such a highway by snowmobiles;  or, alternatively, it may authorize dual use of such highway by snowmobiles and by those conventional highway vehicles that are being used solely for access to property abutting such highway.  Vehicles of any type being used for law enforcement, firefighting, rescue, and road maintenance shall have unrestricted access to such highways in either case.  The bureau or its designee shall post said highways in accordance with the status established by municipal authorities as provided in this paragraph.  Following a duly noticed public hearing, except in the case of an emergency closure, such authorities may change the status of a highway by giving notification to the supervisor of the bureau and removing any signs that no longer apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a snowmobile may be operated within the right-of-way of a public way across a bridge when operated in accordance with a permit issued by the commissioner of public works and highways pursuant to RSA 215-C:2, IX.

Therefore, each person who drives or rides a snowmobile accepts, as a matter of law, the dangers inherent in the sport, and shall not maintain an action against an owner, occupant, or lessee of land for any injuries which result from such inherent risks, dangers, or hazards.  The categories of such risks, hazards, or dangers which the snowmobile user assumes as a matter of law include, but are not limited to, the following:  variations in terrain, trails, paths or roads, surface or subsurface snow or ice conditions, bare spots, rocks, trees, stumps, and other forms of forest growth or debris, structures on the land, equipment not in use, pole lines, fences, and collisions with other operators or persons.
