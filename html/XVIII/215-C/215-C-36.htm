&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 215-C:36 Registration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Registration of a snowmobile or OHRV does not constitute a license to operate the vehicle on private land.  Any person operating a snowmobile upon the land of another shall stop and identify himself or herself upon the request of the landowner or a duly authorized representative and, if requested, shall promptly remove the snowmobile from the premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as otherwise provided, no snowmobile shall be operated in this state unless registered as provided in this chapter.  No registration shall be required for a snowmobile operated solely on land owned or leased by the owner of the snowmobile.  All snowmobile registrations shall expire on July 1 in each year.  The executive director shall collect a fee for each registration as provided in RSA 215-C:39.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The executive director or designee is authorized to establish a snowmobile and OHRV registry.  The executive director shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A for the establishment and requirements of said registry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No person under the age of 18 shall register a snowmobile.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. If a snowmobile is held by a trust, the trust may designate a person who is a beneficiary to register the snowmobile in the person's name pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All snowmobiles shall be registered with a number to be placed on both sides of the front cowl in a location designated by the executive director for the purpose of placing identification numbers.  The registration number shall be contained on a decal of a type and size designated by the executive director.  The number for said vehicle shall be assigned by the executive director or one of his or her agents.  In case of a transfer, the number shall expire and become invalid.  If a new machine is obtained a new number shall be assigned, unless otherwise authorized by the executive director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph V, antique snowmobiles may be registered by a one-time purchase of a permanent plate to be affixed permanently to the snowmobile.  This registration shall be available at the fish and game headquarters only.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding paragraph V, no registration shall be required for a youth model snowmobile when the operator is under 12 years of age and accompanied by a person 18 years of age or older who holds a valid license to operate a snowmobile.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. (a) All snowmobile trails maintenance vehicles shall be registered with a number to be placed and attached in the manner prescribed in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The registration number shall be contained on a decal of a design, color, and size designated by the executive director.  The registration number for said vehicle shall be assigned by the executive director or one of his or her agents.  In case of a transfer, the number shall expire and become invalid.  If a new machine is obtained a new number shall be assigned, unless otherwise authorized by the executive director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. No person shall operate any snowmobile unless the assigned snowmobile registration numbers, plates, or decals are placed on the snowmobile as required by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The registration certificate shall be subject to inspection on demand by any officer authorized to enforce provisions of this chapter.  The registration certificate shall be carried while the snowmobile is in operation.  The operator shall, when requested, show proof of personal identification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. No person shall register a snowmobile at the resident fee, as defined in RSA 215-C:39, unless such person is a resident as defined in RSA 215-C:1.
