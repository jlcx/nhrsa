<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Verbal or written permission given by a landowner to a snowmobile club, the chief of the bureau of trails, or an individual to permit snowmobile operation on trails on his or her property shall in no way be construed as granting a lien or an irrevocable right to operate snowmobiles on said property.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV.
