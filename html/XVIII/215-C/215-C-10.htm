&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person shall not operate a snowmobile on the traveled portions or the plowed snowbanks adjacent to class I, class II, class III, or class III-a highways.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any provisions of the law to the contrary, a person may operate a snowmobile on a class I, class II, class III, or class III-a highway that is not maintained for winter use by conventional motor vehicles;  provided, however, that if a class I, class II, class III, or class III-a highway is not maintained for winter use by conventional motor vehicles and said highway is opened for a snowmobile trail, said highway shall be so posted and conventional motor vehicle traffic prohibited.  The commissioner of the department of transportation, upon notification to the supervisor of the bureau, may open at any time a class I, class II, or class III highway which has been closed for conventional motor vehicle use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person may operate a snowmobile when snow conditions permit, on separate bicycle trails or pedestrian walkways constructed for such purposes by the department of transportation on the interstate highways, toll roads, or limited access highways, if the trails and walkways are designated and maintained as approved snowmobile trails by the bureau and if such designation and maintenance is approved by the commissioner of the department of transportation.
