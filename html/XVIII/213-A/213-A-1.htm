<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The duty of said commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the restoration of Atlantic salmon in the Connecticut River and its tributaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
To promote the restoration, preservation and protection of Atlantic salmon in the Connecticut River basin the commission may draft and recommend to the governors of the various signatory states legislation to accomplish this end.  The commission shall, more than 60 days prior to any regular meeting of the legislature of any signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to proposed enactments to be made by the legislature of the state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The commission shall have the power to recommend to the states party hereto stocking programs, management procedures and research projects and when 2 or more states party hereto shall jointly stock waters or undertake cooperative management or research the commission shall act as the coordinating agency.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the signatory states with regard to other anadromous species and their potential impact or the potential impact of sport fisheries and commercial fisheries for other anadromous species on the restoration of Atlantic salmon to the Connecticut River basin.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In the interest of developing a sound program of Atlantic salmon management the commission shall promulgate regulations governing Atlantic salmon fishing in the main stem of the Connecticut River in all 4 signatory states as hereinafter provided.  Such regulations may:  (1) establish the open and closed seasons for Atlantic salmon which may vary by river section, (2) establish hours, days of periods during the open season when fishing for Atlantic salmon shall not be permitted in designated areas, (3) prescribe the legal methods of taking Atlantic salmon including the type of gear such as gaffs, landing nets or tailers which may be used to assist in landing such fish, (4) establish the minimum legal length for Atlantic salmon, (5) establish the daily creel limit, the season creel limit and the possession limit for Atlantic salmon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The commission shall recommend, review and issue comments on such regulations as may be promulgated by the signatory states governing Atlantic salmon fishing in tributary streams.
