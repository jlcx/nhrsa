&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 215-A:23-a Individual Vanity Plates or Decals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The executive director is hereby authorized to design and to issue vanity plates or decals for residents only to be used on off highway recreational vehicles in lieu of other number plates or decals.  Such plates or decals shall be of such design and shall bear such letters or letters and numbers as the executive director shall prescribe, but there shall be no duplication of identification.  The executive director, or designee, may deny or revoke any plate or decal deemed inappropriate.  Such vanity plates or decals shall be issued only upon application therefor and upon payment of a special fee of $20.  The special fee shall be in addition to the regular OHRV registration fee under RSA 215-A:23 and any fee otherwise required by law for the particular vehicle.  All special fees collected under this section shall be nonlapsing and continually appropriated to the fish and game department for the purposes described in RSA 215-A:23, VIII(b), the administrative costs of this section, and the actual costs to produce the plates or decals.  The executive director shall, if necessary, adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A relative to the application for, design of, issuance, denial, or revocation of vanity plates or decals.
