&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 215-A:41 Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court declares it to be in the public interest to balance the demand for ATV and trail bike trails on state lands:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) With other, non-motorized recreational trail uses;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Potentially conflicting management goals for state lands;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Protection of wildlife and ecologically important areas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In furtherance of the public interest, the bureau, in cooperation with the department of fish and game and all other state agencies that are custodians of the property involved shall work to develop a system of trails for ATVs and trail bikes on both public and private lands that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Uses, to the greatest extent possible, private lands, under voluntary agreement with landowners;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Uses public lands that can host ATV and trail bike trails that are compatible with existing uses and management goals and plans;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Is managed cooperatively with formally established ATV and trail bike clubs recognized by the bureau;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Is regularly monitored for overuse, compliance with laws and regulations, and environmental degradation, with curtailment of trail use if such conditions are found to exist;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Ensures safe and legal use through consistent enforcement of all laws as set forth in this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Provides opportunities for public input in all decisions regarding development of new or significantly revised trail systems on state lands.
