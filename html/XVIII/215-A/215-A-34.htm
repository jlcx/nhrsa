&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An owner may post all or any portion of his land against use by an OHRV.  Such notices may read "SNOW TRAVELING VEHICLES PROHIBITED'' or "OHRVs PROHIBITED'' or may have in lieu of these words an appropriate sign with the designated symbol of sufficient size to be readable at a distance of 50 feet indicating that use of this land is prohibited for the purpose so specified.  Whoever without right enters such land that has been so posted shall be guilty of a violation.  Provided, however, that failure of an owner to post his land as provided in this section shall not be construed as granting any license to users of OHRVs to enter said premises, nor shall said failure be construed as implying any duty of care to the user of an OHRV by the owner.
