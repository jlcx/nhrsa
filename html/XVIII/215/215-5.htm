Every resident 65 years of age or older who has been a licensed guide in this state for 5 or more years may obtain a license as a guide to fish or to hunt not by payment of the fees prescribed in RSA 215:4, I and II, but rather by payment of only the cost of issuing said license as determined by the executive director.
