<codesect>
The executive director, in conjunction with the commissioner of agriculture, markets, and food, may establish and maintain state fish and game refuges for the protection and propagation of fish, game, and fur-bearing animals, on all or any portion of the state fish and game lands, wherein fish, game, and fur-bearing animals shall not be hunted, pursued, taken, disturbed, or molested at any time except as provided in RSA 212:15.  They may also, with and by the consent of the proper authorities, establish and maintain such refuges on state forests, national forests, or otherwise publicly owned lands or waters within the state.  They may also establish and maintain such refuges on privately owned lands with the consent of the owner and abutters, for such purposes.  No such refuge shall exceed in area  1/2 of the total area of the state or national forest on which it is located, nor shall it exceed 2,500 acres in area, if not located on a state or national forest.  No such refuge exceeding 500 acres in area shall be established within 10 miles of another such refuge.
