<codesect>
Fish passage facilities shall be constructed and maintained at existing dams or obstructions in accordance with the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After the executive director of the fish and game department has made a determination that a fish passage facility is needed at an existing dam or obstruction, and upon his request, the governor, with the advice of the council, shall appoint a commission of 3 disinterested citizens of the state to review this determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Said commission shall hold public hearings to determine the need and desirability of providing fish passage facilities over the dam or obstruction, and the deliberations of the commission shall include a careful consideration of the economic values associated with the project.  Upon completion of its study, the commission shall report its findings to the governor and council;  the report shall include any recommendations for special conditions to be associated with the project and a recommendation for the distribution of cost between the owner and the state for construction and maintenance of the fish passage and a recommendation as to whether the owner or the fish and game department shall operate and maintain said fish passage facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon receipt of said report, the governor, with the advice of the council, shall determine the share of the cost of construction and the share of the cost of maintenance to be borne by the owner and by the state.  The state's share shall be a charge on the fish and game fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The actual design and location of fish passage facilities authorized under this section shall be determined by the executive director of the fish and game department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The owner of the dam or obstruction at which a fish passage facility is constructed as provided in this section or the fish and game department, as determined by the governor and council shall, consistent with the primary purpose of the dam or obstruction, operate the fish passage facility to allow for the passage of fish species present during the period of their normal migration as determined by the executive director of the fish and game department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any party to the action or proceedings under this section may apply for a rehearing or appeal under the procedure as provided by RSA 541.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who is licensed to engage in the wholesale trade of marine species in accordance with RSA 211:49-c may engage in the processing of lobster tails after procuring from the executive director a lobster tail permit.  The lobster tail permit authorizes the licensee to remove a lobster tail from a legal sized lobster, as defined in RSA 211:27, I and II, and process that whole and intact lobster tail.  No lobster greater than the maximum legal length as described in RSA 211:27, III shall be used for lobster tail processing.  Processing shall only be conducted at the one location or place of business which is listed on the lobster tail permit.  All containers in which lobster tails are packed to be sold, shipped, or transported must be clearly labeled with the name, address, and permit number of the packer along with a description of the product.  The processing and possession of these lobster tails shall be permitted only for distribution outside New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The executive director may adopt rules relative to the taking, inspection, and processing of lobster necessary for implementation and enforcement of this section in accordance with RSA 211:62 and which may also include rules for determining that lobster tails processed under this section were removed from legal-sized lobsters and other provisions as may be necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Measurements for the purpose of inspection shall consist of removal of the cooked meat intact from the lobster tail section and measured to ascertain conformity with size restrictions as specified in RSA 211:27, II.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The executive director shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to license types, fees, bonding, insurance and the taking, permitting, inspection, possession, processing, sale, propagation, rearing, planting, growth promotion, harvesting, releasing and transportation of aquatic or marine species as related to aquaculture or fishing preserve operations including, but not limited to:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) A person may be granted an aquaculture license by the executive director, under such terms and conditions as he may deem necessary, to release and recapture domestically reared anadromous fish in state waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No license shall be issued which may interfere with the natural or established runs of anadromous fish, result in waste or deterioration of fish, or when the proposed operation is on a stream or river below a state or federal fish hatchery or egg taking station.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All fish released into the wild under the authority of this section, while they are in the wild, will lose their status as private property and may be taken by duly licensed anglers as defined under RSA 207:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any license granted by the executive director pursuant to this section shall contain the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the executive director finds that the operation described in the license and conducted pursuant to this section is not in the public interest, he may alter the conditions of the license to mitigate the adverse effects, or cause an orderly termination of the operation under the license.  An orderly termination shall not exceed a 3-year period and shall culminate in the revocation of the license in its entirety.  During this period, the licensee may continue to take specified domesticated anadromous fish according to the provisions of the license but shall be prohibited from releasing any additional fish.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the executive director finds that the operation has caused deterioration of the natural or established runs of anadromous fish in the waters covered by the license he shall require the licensee to return the run to the same condition as it was prior to the issue of the license.  If the licensee fails to take appropriate action, the executive director may take such action and the licensee shall bear any cost incurred by the agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Prior to the release into state waters all fish shall be examined by a qualified pathologist approved by the executive director and certified that they are not diseased or affected with any disease which in the opinion of the executive director may be detrimental to the resources of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) If the licensed operation is located on a stream or river which does not have a state or federal fish passage facility the licensee shall have the right to divert all fish returning to the stream or river to an inspection area as authorized by the executive director, and shall be allowed to examine all fish for the purpose of identifying domestically reared fish that have returned.  No unmarked fish may be transported from the trapping facility and must immediately be returned unmarked to the stream or river.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) If the operation is located on a stream or river possessing a state owned fish passage facility, fish and game department personnel will examine all fish and separate and hold any marked domestically reared fish that have returned.  The licensee shall reimburse the fish and game department for actual expenses incurred.

I. To search without a warrant and examine any person or any boat, conveyance, vehicle, box, bag, locker, traps, crate or other receptacle or container for marine species, when the conservation officer has reasonable and articulable suspicion to believe that marine species taken contrary to the provisions of this chapter are concealed thereon or therein.
