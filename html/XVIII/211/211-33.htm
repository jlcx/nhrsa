&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 211:33 Distinctive Colors. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each applicant for a lobster and crab license shall state the color scheme or other special markings of the buoys desired to be used by him.  These colors, if approved by the executive director, shall be set forth in his license, and all buoys used by the licensee shall be marked accordingly.  Also, each lobster boat must have painted said colors on port and starboard bow in a section not less than one foot square, or a freshly painted buoy set at the highest point on the boat excluding the mast and visible for 360 degrees.  Such buoy or colors must be permanently attached at all times that lobster gear fished under that license is in the water.
