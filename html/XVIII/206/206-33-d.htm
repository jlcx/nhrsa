<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The executive director may establish a wildlife legacy initiative that encourages gifts and donations to support fish, wildlife, and marine resource conservation projects, conservation education activities, and opportunities to use, access, and appreciate these public resources by promoting the benefits of the initiative and recognizing individuals or organizations for their voluntary participation.  The executive director in establishing any relationship with such persons shall use care to deal with persons who are supportive of the full mission of the fish and game department and not persons opposing the legal taking of game or fish.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The executive director may establish levels of giving and offer incentives for various levels of donations, enter into agreements and partnerships with the public or private sector as necessary to develop, market, promote, solicit for, and conduct the wildlife legacy initiative.  The executive director may issue certificates, documentation, and other gifts to identify and recognize participants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. There is established an account within the fish and game fund to be known as the wildlife legacy initiative account.  All gifts and donations received through the wildlife legacy initiative shall be deposited in this account.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, donations made to the wildlife legacy initiative shall not require acceptance by the commission or the governor and council.  Moneys deposited in the wildlife legacy initiative account are nonlapsing and continually appropriated to the fish and game department and may be used with approval of the fish and game commission for the purposes stated in paragraphs I and II.
