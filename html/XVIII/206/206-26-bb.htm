&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding RSA 153-A:24, any person determined by the department to have acted negligently in requiring a search and rescue response by the department shall be liable to the department for the reasonable cost of the department's expenses for such search and rescue response.  The executive director shall bill the responsible person for such costs.  Payment shall be made to the department within 30 days after the receipt of the bill, or by some other date determined by the executive director.  If any person shall fail or refuse to pay the costs by the required date, the department may pursue payment by legal action, or by settlement or compromise, and the responsible person shall be liable for interest from the date that the bill is due and for legal fees and costs incurred by the department in obtaining and enforcing judgment under this paragraph.  All amounts recovered, less the costs of collection and any percentage due pursuant to RSA 7:15-a, IV(b), shall be paid into the fish and game search and rescue fund established in RSA 206:42.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any person fails to make payment under paragraph I, the executive director of the fish and game department may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Order any license, permit, or tag issued by the fish and game department to be suspended or revoked, after due hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notify the commissioner of the department of health and human services of such nonpayment.  The nonpayment shall constitute cause for revocation of any license or certification issued by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 126-A:20 and RSA 151:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notify the director of motor vehicles of such nonpayment and request suspension of the person's driver's license pursuant to RSA 263:56.
