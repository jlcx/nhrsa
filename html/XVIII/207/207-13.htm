I. Field trials for dogs may be held at such times, in such manner, and under such restrictions, as may be prescribed by the executive director.  Any person wishing to hold a field trial shall first obtain a written permit from the person on whose land it is proposed to hold the trial, present the same to the executive director, and pay a fee of $9.50, including field trials for coon dogs and such night hunts for coon dogs as authorized by paragraph II.  The executive director may thereupon issue a permit for such field trial.  The executive director or his duly authorized agent shall supervise the holding of such field trial, enforce the terms of the permits, and the rules for its conduct.  The executive director shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A for the conduct of field trials as in his opinion are necessary to safeguard the interest of the wildlife of the state, provided that the executive director shall issue permits for beagle trials to any beagle club recognized by the American Kennel Club for trials to be run under the rules and regulations of the American Kennel Club.  The fee for this permit shall not exceed $9.50.  The executive director or his authorized agent shall enforce the terms of such permits.
