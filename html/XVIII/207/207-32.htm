During periods when woodland is closed, the operation of sawmills and other machine units, except trucks and pleasure motor vehicles, in or near woodland may also be suspended and smoking prohibited.  All persons engaged in lumbering operations may be required to furnish sufficient fire guards to patrol areas under operation, to provide sufficient fire-fighting tools which shall be located at convenient places therein, to forbid smoking within such areas and to take all other reasonable precautions to prevent fires.  Each day's violation of any such suspension and each day's failure to meet any requirement hereof shall constitute a violation.  Unlawful smoking shall constitute a violation.
