I. To discourage the use of lead, the fish and game department, in consultation with the department of health and human services and in partnership with the department of environmental services, the Loon Preservation Committee, the Audubon Society of New Hampshire, and the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation, shall institute an educational program consisting of, but not limited to, press releases or articles for all news media, an informational brochure for distribution by licensing agents and at department sponsored training programs, videos for use by television outlets, posters for boat access kiosks and other bulletin boards, and a mobile display for use at public events.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of the educational program is to inform the public about adverse, though unintentional, effects of lead on wildlife, and how to reduce the introduction of lead into the environment through personal action.
