<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of this section, "wild animal'' shall not include fish or marine species.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The executive director, with the approval of the commission, shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the manner of issuance of the wildlife habitat stamp or license, and may, with the approval of the commission, provide for the reproduction, sale, licensing, and other disposal of art created for the stamp.  The art for the stamp may be selected through an art contest administered by the executive director with the approval of the commission.  A stamp may be issued only upon prior authorization by the legislature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V.

The state treasurer may accept public and private grants and donations into the account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The state treasurer shall invest the moneys in the wildlife habitat account as provided by law.  Interest received on investments shall be credited to the account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The wildlife habitat account is continually appropriated and may only be used for the following purposes within the state of New Hampshire:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Providing information to the public on the location of properties managed by the fish and game department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. When stamp and license revenue is used to either obtain an easement under subparagraph VII(c) or purchase land under subparagraph VII(d), no condition shall be accepted which restricts hunting and trapping on the associated land.  This requirement shall not apply to lands used for access purposes or if the executive director finds that it is in the interest of the hunting and trapping community to allow such a restriction.  The executive director shall allow hunting and trapping on such lands, as is permissible, but may prohibit for any length of time the hunting or trapping on the whole or part of such lands when it is necessary for the protection or propagation of a wildlife species or for public safety reasons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The executive director, with the approval of the commission, shall expend the funds in the wildlife habitat account.  Prior to the expenditure of any funds, the fish and game department shall analyze the proposed project and provide the executive director and the commission with recommendations as to the project's usefulness and feasibility.
