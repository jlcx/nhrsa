<codesect>
Any person who wishes to hunt but who has not completed a hunter education program or provided proof of a previous hunting or archery license, as required in RSA 214:23-a, may purchase an apprentice hunting license.  A person holding an apprentice hunting license shall be allowed to hunt only when accompanied by a properly licensed person who is 18 years of age or over.  The fees for an apprentice hunting license shall be as provided in RSA 214:9, I for a resident apprentice hunting license, as provided in RSA 214:9, VI for a nonresident apprentice hunting license, as provided in RSA 214:9, VII-a for a nonresident small game apprentice hunting license, or as provided in RSA 208:5, I for a resident or nonresident archery license.  The properly licensed person who is 18 years of age or over accompanying the apprentice shall be fully accountable for any damage incurred or for any violations which may be committed by the apprentice while hunting.  Any other permits or licenses for hunting shall be purchased as required by the apprentice hunter.  The apprentice hunting license shall not be valid to take moose, shall not apply to the 3-day small game license, and shall not be used as proof of a previous license under RSA 214:23-a, I(c) or II(c).  An apprentice hunting license may be purchased only once in the lifetime of the hunter.
