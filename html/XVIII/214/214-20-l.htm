&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 214:20-l Blood Testing on Certain Hunting Fatalities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When death or serious bodily injury occurs to any person in the course of a hunting related shooting or the result of target practice, the person or persons responsible shall be tested for blood alcohol content.  A law enforcement officer shall request a licensed physician, registered nurse, certified physician's assistant, or qualified medical technician or medical technologist to withdraw blood from each person involved, provided that the officer has probable cause to believe that the person responsible was under the influence of alcohol or a controlled drug or any combination of controlled drug or alcohol.  All tests made under this section shall be conducted by the forensic science laboratory established in RSA 106-B:2-a, or in any other laboratory capable of conducting such tests which is licensed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 as amended.  A copy of any report of any such test shall be kept on file by the medical examiner.  The filed report is not a public record under RSA 91-A.  However, the report shall be made available to any person, including their legal representative, who is or may be involved in a civil, criminal or administrative action arising out of an accident in connection with which the test was performed.
