&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 214:1-d State Migratory Waterfowl License Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person shall at any time hunt, shoot, pursue, kill, or take migratory waterfowl without first procuring, in addition to the applicable hunting license required by RSA 214 and the federal duck stamp required by RSA 209:6, a license to do so under RSA 214:9, XII, for the same period.  A person under the age of 16 years may hunt, shoot, pursue, kill, or take migratory waterfowl without such a license, provided that, while so doing, he or she is accompanied by an adult who has procured such a license.  For the purpose of this section "migratory waterfowl'' shall mean ducks, mergansers, coots, geese, and brant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who violates any provision of this section or RSA 214:9, XII shall be guilty of a violation and shall be guilty of a separate offense for each migratory waterfowl bird taken.
