<codesect>
No person shall at any time hunt, shoot, pursue, kill or take pheasants in this state without first procuring, in addition to the applicable hunting license required by RSA 214:1, a stamp or license to do so under RSA 214:9, X, for the same period.  If a stamp is issued, it must be permanently affixed to the back of said hunting license and signed across the face in a permanent manner with the applicant's signature.  A person under the age of 16 years may hunt, shoot, pursue, kill or take pheasants without such a stamp or license provided that, while so doing, he is accompanied by an adult who has procured such a stamp or license.
