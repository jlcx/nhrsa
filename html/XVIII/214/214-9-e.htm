&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The executive director and the commission jointly may, after notice and public hearing, issue stamps or permits for the taking of any species of wildlife.  A majority of the commission and the executive director shall agree to take such action before it shall be authorized.  The decision to issue such stamp or permit shall be recorded in the minutes of the commission which shall also indicate the agreement of the executive director to such action.  Notwithstanding RSA 214:1, the purchase of such stamp or permit where authorized shall permit the taking of such species and the purchase of such stamp or permit shall be required before such species may be taken.  The decision to authorize such stamps or permits shall not be considered a rule subject to the provisions of RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The executive director and the commission jointly may, after notice and public hearing, rescind any action taken under paragraph I of this section by following the same procedure specified in paragraph I of this section for authorizing the issuance of a stamp or permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the issuance of a stamp or permit is authorized under the provisions of this section a fee for such stamp or permit shall be adopted by rule under RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The state treasurer shall establish a separate nonlapsing account within the fish and game fund for each such stamp or permit, to which all fees collected by the fish and game department from such stamps or permits shall be applied.  The moneys in these accounts shall be used, in accordance with RSA 212-A:15, exclusively for the implementation of comprehensive management programs, including education, research, protection and management, and are hereby appropriated for said purpose.
