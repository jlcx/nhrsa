<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All skins as specified in paragraph I shall be presented to a conservation officer, he shall tag or seal the same if legally taken.  Such skins shall be presented for tagging or sealing during the open season in which they are caught or within 10 days after the closing of the open season thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any of the skins as specified in paragraph I that come into this state in any manner from any other state, country or province shall bear the official tag, seal or stamp of such other state, country or province.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If any of the skins as specified in paragraph I come into this state from another state, country or province and said state, country or province does not require an official tag, seal or stamp, the person possessing such skins shall have said skins tagged or sealed within 3 days of entrance into this state in accordance with this section, or he shall possess an itemized bill of sale and said bill of sale shall be produced for inspection upon the request of any law enforcement officer.

The executive director shall notify all licensed trappers and hunters in advance of the opening of the season of the species of fur-bearers to be turned over to the department.
