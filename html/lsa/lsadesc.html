<p align="left"><font size="3">Each year new laws are passed which amend current
sections in the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSAs), insert new
sections, reenact sections or repeal sections. The printed and online versions
of the RSAs do not reflect these changes until late in the fall of each year. In
the case of the printed version, new cumulative pocket parts are issued and the
online version is updated.</font>
<p><font size="3">In order to determine the current law before the changes are
made to the RSAs, the Sections Affected should be used.</font>
<p><font size="3">The Sections Affected provides a list of all the changes made
to the Revised Statutes by the laws passed in the current year. It is arranged
by RSA Chapter number. To determine if a chapter has been changed, there are
several search options.</font>
<p><font size="3" color="#008000"><b>SEARCH</b></font>
<p><font size="3">1. Click on the down arrow in the Search by RSA box, and a
dropdown box will display all the RSAs affected by the laws passed in the
current year. Scroll down to the Chapter and Section that needs to be updated
and click on it and then click on Search.</font>
<p><font size="3"><i>If the RSA Chapter or section do not appear, then it was
not affected by the laws passed to date.</i></font>
<p><font size="3">In addition to searching by <b>RSA Chapter</b>, Sections
Affected can also be searched by <b>Session Law Chapters</b>, <b>Private Acts</b>
and <b>Bill Numbers</b>. All of these, have dropdown menus which list all the
respective items. Scroll down to the one of interest , click on it., and then
click on Search.</font>
<p><font size="3"><font color="#FF0000"><i>Note:</i></font><i> Only one type of
search can be performed at a time. You cannot combine searches. Select only one
box.</i></font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Chapter</b> - As laws are passed they are given a Chapter
number. The first law passed is assigned 1, the next one 2 and so forth. These
chapter numbers have no relationship to the RSA chapter numbers. They are used
to refer to a law passed in a specific year (e.g. Chapter 2 of the Laws of 2000)
By clicking on a chapter, and then clicking Search, all the RSA Chapters and
sections affected by the Chapter law will display.</font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Private Ac</b>t - Laws that do not affect any sections of
the RSAs are called private acts. Often they affect only a specific town or
organization. By clicking on Private Acts, and then clicking on Search, all the
Private Acts will display.</font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Bill Number</b> - By clicking on the bill number that
became law, and then clicking on Search, all the RSA Chapters and Sections
affected by the bill number which has become law will display.</font>
<p><font size="3" color="#008000"><b>DISPLAY</b></font>
<p><font size="3">The display for all the searches will be the same. The
following columns of information will be provided:</font><font color="#0000a0" size="3"><font color="#800000" size="3">
