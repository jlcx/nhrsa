&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 456-B:6 Foreign Notarial Acts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A notarial act has the same effect under the law of this state as if performed by a notarial officer of this state if performed within the jurisdiction of and under authority of a foreign nation or its constituent units or a multi-national or international organization by any of the following persons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A notary public or notary;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A judge, clerk, or deputy clerk of a court of record;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any other person authorized by the law of that jurisdiction to perform notarial acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An "Apostille'' in the form prescribed by the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961, conclusively establishes that the signature of the notarial officer is genuine and that the officer holds the indicated office.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A certificate by a foreign service or consular officer of the United States stationed in the nation under the jurisdiction of which the notarial act was performed, or a certificate by a foreign service or consular officer of that nation stationed in the United States, conclusively establishes any matter relating to the authenticity or validity of the notarial act set forth in the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An official stamp or seal of the person performing the notarial act is prima facie evidence that the signature is genuine and that the person holds the indicated title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An official stamp or seal of an officer listed in subparagraph I(a) or (b) is prima facie evidence that a person with the indicated title has authority to perform notarial acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the title of office and indication of authority to perform notarial acts appears either in a digest of foreign law or in a list customarily used as a source for that information, the authority of an officer with that title to perform notarial acts is conclusively established.
