The amount of motor fuel or fuel sold to and used in the propulsion of aircraft shall be determined by, and the toll shall be collected by, the director of motor vehicles, under the authority and procedure established by the provisions of RSA 260:30-65-a and the director of motor vehicles may further promulgate and establish such additional rules, regulations and procedures as the director may deem necessary in the collection and allocation of the airways toll provided herein.  In the case of sales of fuel, the airways toll shall be collected at the time of the sale of such fuel, and payment made to the director in the same manner as in the case of motor fuel.  The director shall pay monthly to the state treasurer all revenue collected in accordance with the foregoing provisions.

The director of motor vehicles, before paying over to the state treasurer revenue collected from said airways toll, shall deduct therefrom expenses of collection.
