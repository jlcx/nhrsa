&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any municipality or person desiring or planning to construct or establish an airport prior to the acquisition of the site or prior to the construction or establishment of the proposed airport may make application to the department for approval of the site.  The department shall, with reasonable dispatch, grant approval of the site if it is satisfied:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the site is adequate for the proposed airport;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That such proposed airport, if constructed or established, will conform to minimum standards of safety;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That safe air traffic patterns could be worked out for such proposed airport and for all existing airports and approved airport sites in its vicinity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An approval of a site may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions which the department may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, and shall remain in effect, unless revoked sooner by the department, until a registration for an airport located on the approved site has been issued pursuant to RSA 422:17, or a period of 10 years, whichever shall first occur.  No approval shall be required for the site of any existing airport.
