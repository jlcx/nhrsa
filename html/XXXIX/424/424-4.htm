<codesect>
The department of transportation is hereby empowered and directed to formulate and adopt, and from time to time as may be necessary revise, an airport-approach plan for such airports as are privately owned but which have been licensed for commercial operation, have facilities available for public use and are necessary in the opinion of the department for the maintenance of an effective airway system in the state.  Every privately-owned airport so designated by the department is hereby declared to be eligible for zoning protection and for the purposes hereof shall be deemed to be a publicly-owned airport for the purposes of airport zoning as provided in this chapter.
