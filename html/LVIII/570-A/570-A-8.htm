I. Any law enforcement officer who, by any means authorized by this chapter, has obtained knowledge of the contents of any telecommunication or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, may disclose such contents to another law enforcement officer to the extent that such disclosure is appropriate to the proper performance of the official duties of the officer making or receiving the disclosure.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who has received, by any means authorized by this chapter, any information concerning a telecommunication or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom intercepted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter may disclose the contents of that communication or such derivative evidence while giving testimony under oath or affirmation in any criminal proceeding in any court of the United States or of any state or in any federal or state grand jury proceeding.
