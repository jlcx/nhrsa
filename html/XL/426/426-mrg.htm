&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 426:4 Use of Brands and Labels Restricted. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
After the establishment of grades and standards and the determination of the design of the brands or labels as provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful to use such brand or label to identify farm products as being of an established grade or standard without authorization for its use, or after the revocation of the right to use such brand or label by the commissioner.  For the purpose of further protecting the grades as officially established by the commissioner, or any grades established under an act of Congress by the United States Department of Agriculture on the same products, it shall be unlawful to use the officially designated grade words, titles, or names for the purpose of identifying, advertising, designating, or describing any lots of such products unless such designated grade words, titles, or names for the purpose of identifying, advertising, designating, or describing any lots of such products unless such products fully meet the requirements of the official grade indicated.  When, in the opinion of the commissioner or the commissioner's representative, it is believed that any lot or lots of such products so identified, advertised, designated, or described may not be of the grade indicated, the commissioner shall cause inspections of such products to be made for the purpose of determining the actual grade.
