<codesect>
The commissioner may employ inspectors to inspect farm products, marked, branded or labeled in accordance with official grades or standards so established, for the purpose of determining and certifying the quality and condition thereof and other material facts relative thereto.  Upon such investigation, the inspector may issue a certificate which shall state the date and place of inspection, the grade, condition and quality of the farm products inspected and such other facts as the commissioner may require.  Such a certificate and all federal certificates relative to the condition or quality of said farm products shall be prima facie evidence in all courts of the state of the facts set forth in such certificates.
