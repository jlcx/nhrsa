<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Exemptions from the inspection requirements of RSA 438:14 with respect to weights and measures of such character or size that such inspection would be inappropriate, impracticable, or damaging, to the apparatus in question or from standards listed in RSA 438:8, II and RSA 438:8, III which may cause, in the opinion of the commissioner, disproportionate cost or undue economic hardship to a public solid waste management district, as defined in RSA 53-B, a public facility, as defined in RSA 149-M:4, or transfer station, as defined in RSA 149-M:4.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Specifications, tolerances, and other technical requirements for weights and measures of the character of those specified in RSA 438:10, designed to eliminate from use, without prejudice to apparatus that conforms as closely as practicable to the official standards, those:

For the purpose of this chapter, apparatus shall be deemed to be "correct'' when it conforms to all applicable rules adopted as specified in this section.  Other apparatus shall be deemed to be "incorrect.''
