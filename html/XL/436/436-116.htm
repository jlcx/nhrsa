&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 436:116 Program Goals;  Applicable Federal Regulations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The voluntary scrapie flock certification program is a cooperative effort between APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture), participating state governments, and sheep and goat producing industries, established and maintained to reduce scrapie's occurrence and spread, identify flocks that have been free of evidence of scrapie over specified time periods, and contribute to the eventual eradication of scrapie.  Applicable federal regulations regarding the program and its requirements are contained in 9 CFR parts 54 and 79.  Compliance with requirements outlined by this subdivision does not excuse program participants from compliance with the complete program requirements provided by 9 CFR parts 54 and 79.
