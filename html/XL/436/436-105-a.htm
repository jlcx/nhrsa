&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any cat displaying symptoms which indicate a likelihood that such cat is afflicted with rabies which has bitten a person and caused a puncture of the skin or which has caused a nonbite exposure shall be immediately euthanized and the head sent for examination to the public health laboratory, department of health and human services.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner for any expense for euthanizing the cat and for preparing the head for shipment to the public health laboratory.  If the owner of the cat is not known, the rabies control authority shall be responsible for the expense, and such expense shall be paid from fees collected under RSA 466:4 and 466:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any apparently healthy cat not vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown which has bitten any person and caused a puncture of the skin or which has caused a nonbite exposure of the person shall be seized and, if the owner consents, impounded under the supervision of the local authorities for a period of not less than 10 days.  If, upon examination by a licensed veterinarian, the cat has no signs of rabies at the end of the impoundment, it may be released to the owner.  Any illness in the cat during confinement or before release shall be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.  If signs suggestive of rabies develop, the cat shall be euthanized and the head sent for examination to the public health laboratory, department of health and human services.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner for any expense for the examination and for the impoundment of the cat.  If the owner of the cat is not known or if the owner does not consent to impoundment, the cat shall be euthanized upon seizure and the head sent for examination to the public health laboratory, department of health and human services.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner for any expense for euthanizing the cat and for preparing the head for shipment to the public health laboratory.  If the owner of the cat is not known, the rabies control authority shall be responsible for the expense and such expense shall be paid from fees collected under RSA 466:4 and 466:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any healthy cat vaccinated in accordance with RSA 436:100, which has bitten any person and caused a puncture of the skin or which has caused a nonbite exposure, shall be confined by the owner or other responsible person as required by the local authorities for a period of 10 days, at which time the cat shall be examined by a licensed veterinarian.  If no signs of rabies are observed by the veterinarian, the cat may be released from confinement.  Any illness in the cat during confinement or before release shall be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.  If signs suggestive of rabies develop, the cat shall be euthanized and the head sent for examination to the public health laboratory, department of health and human services.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner for any expense for the examination and the impoundment of the cat, for euthanizing the cat and for preparing the head for shipment to the public health laboratory.  If the owner of the cat does not consent to the confinement or if the owner of the cat is not known, the rabies control authority shall be responsible for the expense and such expense shall be paid from fees collected under RSA 466:4 and 466:6.
