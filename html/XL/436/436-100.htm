&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, every dog, cat, and ferret 3 months of age and older shall be vaccinated against rabies.  Young dogs, cats, and ferrets shall be vaccinated within 30 days after they have reached 3 months of age.  Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets acquired or moved into the state shall be vaccinated within 30 days after purchase or arrival, unless under 3 months of age, as specified above.  Every dog, cat, and ferret shall be revaccinated between 9 and 12 months after the initial vaccination and subsequently receive booster vaccines as outlined in the most current National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians' Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control.  In rabies infected areas, dogs, cats, and ferrets recently vaccinated shall be kept under control for at least 30 days before being allowed to run free.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A rabies immunization exemption may be issued, where illness or a veterinary medical condition warrants, by the local rabies control authority upon the written recommendation of a veterinarian licensed under RSA 332-B.  The recommendation shall also be signed by an American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine diplomate and the state veterinarian.  The exempted animal shall be maintained in strict rabies isolation, under conditions that are at the discretion of the local rabies control authority, until such time as the medical condition has been resolved and the animal can be immunized against rabies.  Exempted animals shall not be allowed outdoors without being on a leash and shall be under the direct physical control of an adult owner at all times.  In addition, when the animal is outdoors, it shall be muzzled in a manner approved by the local rabies control authority.  The exemption shall be valid for no more than one year from the date of the last signature on the written recommendation for exemption.
