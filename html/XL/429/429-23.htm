<codesect>
It shall be unlawful to use the term "honey'', however modified, to describe any product, flavoring, sweetener or food additive unless the product, flavoring, sweetener or food additive so described meets the statutory definition of "honey''.  Terms such as "artificial honey'' are declared to be misleading and deceptive and may not be used in the labeling or advertising of any product.  Terms such as "artificial honey flavor'' or "artificial honey flavor sweetener'' may be used to describe a product flavored or sweetened with a substance which attempts to duplicate real honey flavor, providing that words such as "artificial'', "flavor'', and other modifiers of the word "honey'' shall appear in equal prominence and in letters of equal size to the word "honey'' on the label and in all advertising of the product.
