&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 430:40 Experimental Use Permits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Provided the state is authorized by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency to issue experimental use permits and subject to the terms and conditions of such authorization, the division may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Issue an experimental use permit to any person applying for such permit if determined that the applicant needs such permit in order to accumulate information necessary to register a pesticide for special local needs under RSA 430:39.  An application for an experimental use permit may be filed at the time of or before or after an application for registration is filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Refuse to issue an experimental use permit if determined that issuance of such permit is not warranted or that the pesticide applications that would be made under the proposed terms and conditions may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Prescribe terms, conditions, and a period of time for the experimental use permit, which shall be under supervision of the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Revoke or modify any experimental use permit, at any time, if it is found that its terms or conditions are being violated or that its terms or conditions are inadequate to avoid adverse unreasonable effects on the environment.
