&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 430:9 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For the purpose of preserving and promoting the public health and welfare by providing for the control of mosquitos and other arthropods of public health and welfare significance (hereinafter referred to as mosquitos), the creation of mosquito control districts is hereby authorized.  The boundaries of the districts shall cover the same area as the boundaries of the cities and towns in the district.  The mosquito control districts may further be identified by that state region in which they are located.  Permanent control of mosquitos shall be the primary aim of the state committee, recommending and initiating only such temporary measures as are necessary and judicious, to be guided by the various state, federal and local departmental requirements.

<center><h3>Section 430:21</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 430:21 Compact Enacted. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The Pest Control Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
<center>
<p>
<b>Article I</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Findings</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The party states find that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this compact, the annual loss of approximately 7 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Because of varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests;  but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another to complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crop and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an insurance fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interests, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.

<p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. Assist in the coordination of activities pursuant to the compact in his state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Represent his state on the governing board of the insurance fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefor within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the governing board of the insurance fund by not to exceed 3 representatives.  Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, but no such representative shall have a vote on the governing board or on the executive committee thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The governing board shall meet at least once each year for the purpose of determining policies and procedures in the administration of the insurance fund and, consistent with the provisions of the compact, supervising and giving direction to the expenditure of moneys from the insurance fund.  Additional meetings of the governing board shall be held on call of the chairman, the executive committee, or a majority of the membership of the governing board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) At such times as it may be meeting, the governing board shall pass upon applications for assistance from the insurance fund and authorize disbursements therefrom.  When the governing board is not in session, the executive committee thereof shall act as agent of the governing board, with full authority to act for it in passing upon such applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The executive committee shall be composed of the chairman of the governing board and 4 additional members of the governing board chosen by it so that there shall be one member representing each of the 4 geographic groupings of party states.  The governing board shall make such geographic groupings.  If there is representation of the United States on the governing board, one such representative may meet with the executive committee.

</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests.  It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. The maintenance of pest control and eradication activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level that would be reasonable for its protection in the absence of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been done in the absence of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, or whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the governing board to authorize expenditures from the insurance fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent, or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state.  Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted.  A responding state shall use moneys made available from the insurance fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In order to apply for expenditures from the insurance fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. A detailed statement of the circumstances which occasion the request for the invoking of the compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
3. A statement of the extent of the present and projected program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefor, in connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of introduction of the pest concerned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
4. Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
5. A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the invoking of the compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of moneys from the insurance fund in one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
6. Such other information as the governing board may require consistent with the provisions of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The governing board or executive committee shall give due notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the insurance fund is to be considered.  Such notice shall be given to the compact administrator of each party state and to such other officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party states.  The requesting state and any other party state shall be entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this compact and justified thereby, the governing board or executive committee shall authorize support of the program.  The governing board or the executive committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application.  Any and all determinations of the governing board or executive committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefor shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a determination of the executive committee shall, upon notice in writing given within 20 days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the governing board.  Determinations of the executive committee shall be reviewable only by the governing board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the governing board may authorize.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this compact may receive moneys from the insurance fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the insurance fund.  The governing board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Before authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the insurance fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the insurance fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation which may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of the federal government for such assistance and participation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The insurance fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent and degree of assistance or participation between and among the insurance fund, cooperating federal agencies, states and any other entities concerned.

Any such advisory or technical committee, or any member or members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations.  Upon request of the governing board or executive committee an advisory or technical committee may furnish information and recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from the insurance fund being considered by such board or committee and the board or committee may receive and consider the same;  provided that any participant in a meeting of the governing board or executive committee held pursuant to Article VI(d) of the compact shall be entitled to know the substance of any such information and recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto, or as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at which the governing board or executive committee makes its disposition of the application.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A party state may make application for assistance from the insurance fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state.  Such application shall be considered and disposed of by the governing board or executive committee in the same manner as an application with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in this Article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At or in connection with any meeting of the governing board or executive committee held pursuant to Article VI(d) of this compact a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate, and receive information only to such extent as the governing board or executive committee may provide.  A nonparty state shall not be entitled to review any determination made by the executive committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The governing board or executive committee shall authorize expenditures from the insurance fund to be made in a nonparty state only after determining that the conditions in such state and the value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify them.  The governing board or executive committee may set any conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure of moneys from the insurance fund in a nonparty state and may enter into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the insurance fund with respect to expenditures and activities outside of party states.

<b>Finance</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The insurance fund shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget for the insurance fund for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for presentation to the legislature thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.  The requests for appropriations shall be apportioned among the party states as follows:   1/10 of the total budget in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products, produced in each party state.  In determining the value of such crops and products the insurance fund may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states.  Each of the budgets and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning the value of products.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The financial assets of the insurance fund shall be maintained in 2 accounts to be designated respectively as the "Operating Account'' and the "Claims Account''.  The operating account shall consist only of those assets necessary for the administration of the insurance fund during the next ensuing 2-year period.  The claims account shall contain all moneys not included in the operating account and shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be sufficient to pay all legitimate claims on the insurance fund for a period of 3 years.  At any time when the claims account has reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the addition of moneys requested for appropriation by the party states, the governing board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata basis in such manner as to keep the claims account within such maximum limit.  Any moneys in the claims account by virtue of conditional donations, grants or gifts shall be included in calculations made pursuant to this paragraph only to the extent that such moneys are available to meet demands arising out of claims.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The insurance fund shall not pledge the credit of any party state.  The insurance fund may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with moneys available to it under Article IV(g) of this compact, provided that the governing board takes specific action setting aside such moneys prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner.  Except where the insurance fund makes use of moneys available to it under Article IV(g) hereof, the insurance fund shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of moneys by the party states adequate to meet the same.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The insurance fund shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and disbursements of the insurance fund shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.  However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the insurance fund shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and a report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the insurance fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The accounts of the insurance fund shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly authorized officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the insurance fund.

(b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 2 years after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states.

I. Provided the state is certified by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, if required, to register pesticides to meet special local needs pursuant to section 24(c) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended, the division shall require the information set forth in RSA 430:38 and shall, subject to the terms and conditions of the United States Environmental Protection Agency certification, register such pesticide if it is determined that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Its composition is such as to warrant the proposed claims for it;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Its labeling and other material required to be submitted comply with the requirements of this subdivision;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) It will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice it will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A special local need exists;  provided that, prior to registering a pesticide for a special local need, the board shall classify the uses of the pesticide for general or restricted use in conformity with section 3(d) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended, and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto;  provided, further, that the division shall not make any lack of essentiality a criterion for denying registration of any pesticide.  If 2 pesticides meet the requirements of this paragraph, one may not be registered in preference to the other.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board may develop and adopt such other requirements by rules as are necessary for the state plan to receive certification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Provided the state is certified by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, if required, to register pesticides formulated to meet special local needs, the division shall consider the following for refusal to register, for suspension, for cancellation, or for legal recourse for such pesticides:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If it appears to the division that an application for registration cannot be granted pursuant to paragraphs I and II, and any rules adopted thereunder, the applicant shall be notified of the manner in which the pesticide, labeling, or other material required to be submitted fails to comply with this subdivision or any rules thereunder, so as to afford the applicant an opportunity to make the necessary corrections.  If, upon receipt of such notice the applicant does not make the required changes, the division may refuse to register the pesticide.  The applicant may request a hearing as otherwise provided in this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the division determines that a pesticide or its label does not comply with this subdivision or the rules adopted thereunder, or when necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, they may cancel the registration of a pesticide or change the classification of a pesticide, after a hearing in accordance with this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the division determines that there is an imminent hazard, they may, on their own motion, suspend the registration of a pesticide in conformance with RSA 541-A, the administrative procedure act.  Hearings shall be held as soon as practicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any person who may be adversely affected by any order issued pursuant to this section may obtain judicial review thereunder by filing in the superior court, within 60 days after the entry of such order, a petition praying that the order be set aside in whole or in part.  A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the division and thereupon the division shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which they based their order.  The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm or set aside the order complained of in whole or in part.  The findings of the division with respect to questions of fact shall be sustained if supported by substantial evidence when considered on the record as a whole.  Upon application, the court may remand the matter to the division to make further testimony if there are unreasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the prior hearing.  The division may modify their findings and their order by reason of the additional evidence so taken and shall file the additional record and any modification of the findings or order with the clerk of the court.

<center><h3>Section 430:50</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 430:50 Program Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner of the department of agriculture, markets, and food shall establish an integrated pest management program.  "Integrated pest management'' means a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining the use of biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tactics in a way that minimizes economic, health, and environmental risks.  The purpose of the program shall be to bring about the broadest possible application of the principles of integrated pest management to agriculture, horticulture, arborculture, landscape and building maintenance, and any other areas in which economic poisons are employed.  To this end, the commissioner shall work cooperatively with the university of New Hampshire agricultural experiment station, cooperative extension, and college of life sciences and agriculture;  other educational institutions with competence in relevant disciplines;  commodity and trade organizations;  conservation groups;  other governmental agencies;  and private sector individuals and corporations.  Wherever possible, such research, education, and evaluation endeavors shall be conducted cooperatively by 2 or more supporting entities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There is established a nonlapsing fund to be known as the integrated pest management fund.  Twenty-five percent of the pesticide registration fees collected under RSA 430:38, III shall be deposited in the fund.  The fund shall only be used to support the purposes of the integrated pest management program.  The state treasurer may invest moneys in the fund as provided by law and all interest received on such investment shall be credited to the fund.  The commissioner shall be authorized to accept grants, gifts, and donations from any public or private sources for deposit in the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall report by October 1 of each year to the house environment and agriculture committee and the senate environment committee concerning the use of the fund, the work accomplished, and the effectiveness of efforts to broaden application of integrated pest management principles throughout the state.
