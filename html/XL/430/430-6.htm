&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 430:6 Suppression by Property Owners. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For the purposes of this subdivision, the commissioner and the state entomologist may require the owner of any parcel of land which is infested with any destructive insect pest or plant disease to take such measures as, in their judgment, are reasonable and proper, up to a cost not exceeding, in any one year,  1/2 of one percent of the assessed valuation of said land, including buildings and improvements thereon, as fixed by the last preceding tax appraisal.  If the owner of such lands shall fail to execute the prescribed measures, the commissioner and the state entomologist may cause the work to be done, either directly or through the town in which the land is situated, and the expense thereof, not exceeding  1/2 of one percent of the assessed valuation of said land as specified, shall be assessed upon said lands and improvements.
