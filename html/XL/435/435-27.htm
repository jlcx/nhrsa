&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purpose of enforcement of this subdivision, and in order to determine whether its provisions have been complied with, including whether or not any operations may be subject to such provisions, officers or employees duly designated by the commissioner, upon presenting appropriate credentials and a written notice to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, are authorized (a) to enter, during normal business hours, any factory, warehouse, or establishment within the state in which commercial feeds are manufactured, processed, packed, or held for distribution, or to enter any vehicle being used to transport or hold such feeds;  and (b) to inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, such factory, warehouse, establishment or vehicle and all pertinent equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, and labeling therein.  The inspection may include the verification of only such records, and production and control procedures as may be necessary to determine compliance with the good manufacturing practice rules adopted under RSA 435:23, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A separate notice shall be given for each such inspection, but a notice shall not be required for each entry made during the period covered by the inspection.  Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness.  Upon completion of the inspection, the person in charge of the facility or vehicle shall be so notified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the officer or employee making such inspection of a factory, warehouse, or other establishment has obtained a sample in the course of the inspection, upon completion of the inspection and prior to leaving the premises he shall give to the owner, operator, or agent in charge a receipt describing the samples obtained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the owner of any factory, warehouse or establishment described in paragraph I or his agent refuses to admit the commissioner or his agent to inspect in accordance with paragraphs I and II, the commissioner is authorized to obtain from any state court a warrant directing such owner or his agent to submit the premises described in such warrant to inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For the purpose of the enforcement of this subdivision, the commissioner or his duly designated agent is authorized to enter upon any public or private premises including any vehicle of transport during regular business hours to have access to, and to obtain samples, and to examine records relating to distribution of commercial feeds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted in accordance with methods published by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, or in accordance with other generally recognized methods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The results of all analyses of official samples shall be forwarded by the commissioner to the person named on the label and to the purchaser.  When the inspection and analysis of an official sample indicate a commercial feed has been adulterated or misbranded, and upon request within 30 days following receipt of the analysis, the commissioner shall furnish to the registrant a portion of the sample concerned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner, in determining for administrative purposes whether a commercial feed is deficient in any component, shall be guided by the official sample as defined in RSA 435:19, XVI and obtained and analyzed as provided for in paragraphs III, V and VI above.
