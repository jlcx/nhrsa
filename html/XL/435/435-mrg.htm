For the purpose of enforcement of this subdivision, and in order to determine whether its provisions have been complied with, including whether or not any operations may be subject to such provisions, officers or employees duly designated by the commissioner, upon presenting appropriate credentials and a written notice to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, are authorized (a) to enter, during normal business hours, any factory, warehouse, or establishment within the state in which commercial feeds are manufactured, processed, packed, or held for distribution, or to enter any vehicle being used to transport or hold such feeds;  and (b) to inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, such factory, warehouse, establishment or vehicle and all pertinent equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, and labeling therein.  The inspection may include the verification of only such records, and production and control procedures as may be necessary to determine compliance with the good manufacturing practice rules adopted under RSA 435:23, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A separate notice shall be given for each such inspection, but a notice shall not be required for each entry made during the period covered by the inspection.  Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness.  Upon completion of the inspection, the person in charge of the facility or vehicle shall be so notified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the officer or employee making such inspection of a factory, warehouse, or other establishment has obtained a sample in the course of the inspection, upon completion of the inspection and prior to leaving the premises he shall give to the owner, operator, or agent in charge a receipt describing the samples obtained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the owner of any factory, warehouse or establishment described in paragraph I or his agent refuses to admit the commissioner or his agent to inspect in accordance with paragraphs I and II, the commissioner is authorized to obtain from any state court a warrant directing such owner or his agent to submit the premises described in such warrant to inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For the purpose of the enforcement of this subdivision, the commissioner or his duly designated agent is authorized to enter upon any public or private premises including any vehicle of transport during regular business hours to have access to, and to obtain samples, and to examine records relating to distribution of commercial feeds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted in accordance with methods published by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, or in accordance with other generally recognized methods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The results of all analyses of official samples shall be forwarded by the commissioner to the person named on the label and to the purchaser.  When the inspection and analysis of an official sample indicate a commercial feed has been adulterated or misbranded, and upon request within 30 days following receipt of the analysis, the commissioner shall furnish to the registrant a portion of the sample concerned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner, in determining for administrative purposes whether a commercial feed is deficient in any component, shall be guided by the official sample as defined in RSA 435:19, XVI and obtained and analyzed as provided for in paragraphs III, V and VI above.

I. When the commissioner or his authorized agent has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of this subdivision or of any rule adopted under this subdivision, he may issue and enforce a written or printed "withdrawal from distribution'' order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until written permission is given by the commissioner or the court.  The commissioner shall release the lot of commercial feed so withdrawn when said provisions and rules have been complied with.  If compliance is not obtained within 30 days, the commissioner may begin, or upon request of the distributor or registrant shall begin, proceedings for condemnation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any lot of commercial feed not in compliance with said provisions and rules shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the commissioner to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which said commercial feed is located.  In the event the court finds the commercial feed to be in violation of this subdivision and orders the condemnation of commercial feed, it shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of the state;  provided that in no instance shall the disposition of said commercial feed be ordered by the court without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of said commercial feed or for permission to process or relabel said commercial feed to bring it into compliance with this subdivision.
