If after inspection the department finds that the premises and cages and facilities thereon meet the proper standards for health and sanitation and that their use will not result in inhumane treatment of said animals or birds, and proof is provided with the application that the zoning enforcement official of the municipality wherein such facility is to be maintained has certified that the facility conforms to the municipal zoning regulations, a license shall be issued.  Licenses shall expire on June 30 following issue, and may be renewed on application to the department accompanied by a renewal fee of $200.  Such licenses shall be in the form prescribed by the department, shall be publicly displayed at the premises covered by them, and shall be adjacent to animal display cages.  Each such license shall be subject to revocation at any time by the department, if in the judgment of the department the conditions under which it was issued are not being maintained.
