&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 437-A:2 Program Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department shall establish and implement an animal population control program.  The purpose of this program shall be to reduce the population of unwanted and stray dogs and cats by encouraging the owners of dogs and cats to have them permanently sexually sterilized, thereby reducing potential threats to public health and safety from mid-Atlantic rabies and other sources.  The program shall not begin operation until June 1, 1994.  The commissioner shall make an annual report relative to the progress of the program beginning on September 1, 1994, to the president of the senate, the speaker of the house and the governor.
