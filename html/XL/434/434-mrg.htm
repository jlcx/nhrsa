Before establishing, amending or modifying any such grades, the commissioner shall consult with growers and shippers of apples relative to proposed grades, or, upon written petition of 10 or more growers producing annually an aggregate of not less than 100,000 bushels of apples, the commissioner shall, after reasonable notice specifying the date, place and purpose of the proposed hearing, hold a public hearing for the purpose of obtaining information with a view to establishing or amending or modifying as the case may be, such official grades.  The grades so established shall include grades identical in name and requirements with all grades or standards of apples as promulgated from time to time by the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States and commonly known as the United States grades.  The commissioner may, in an emergency and after consultation with representative growers, establish temporary grades, without holding a public hearing, but he shall indicate the period for which such temporary grades will be in effect.  Apples not conforming to official grades, or, if conforming, not branded in accordance therewith, shall be considered "unclassified'' and so branded.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purposes of this subdivision, "native lumber'' means wood processed in the state of New Hampshire by mills registered in accordance with the provisions of RSA 227-I.  Such wood shall be considered certified or stamped in accordance with the requirements of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a mill registered in accordance with RSA 227-I selling native lumber shall, when required, certify in writing to the purchaser on a form approved by the commissioner of agriculture, markets, and food that the quality and safe working stresses of the lumber are equal to or better than No. 2 grade in accordance with the conditions set forth in the American Softwood Standard PS 20-70, or as amended, provided that lumber for use in load bearing wall members shall be of stud grade minimum.  The certificate shall include wood species, quantity, location of use, green or dry, sawmill name, name of permitted grader and date.  The certification shall be filed with the local building official having jurisdiction as part of the building permit application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), a mill registered in accordance with RSA 227-I selling native timber may stamp such timber.
