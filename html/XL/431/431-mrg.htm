The guarantees for such other nutrients shall be expressed in the form of the element.  The source (oxides, salts, chelates, etc.) of such other nutrients may be required to be stated on the application for registration and may be included on the label.  Other beneficial substances or compounds, determinable by laboratory methods, also may be guaranteed by permission of the commissioner and with the advice of the director of the agricultural experiment station.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There shall be paid to the commissioner for all fertilizers distributed in this state to nonregistrants an inspection fee on each ton of fertilizer sold in a manner and at a fee prescribed by the commissioner by rules;  provided, that sales or exchanges between importers, manufacturers, distributors, or registrants are exempted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every registrant who distributes fertilizer in the state shall file with the commissioner a semiannual statement for the reporting period setting forth the number of net tons of each fertilizer so distributed in this state during such period.  The report shall be due on or before 30 days following the close of the filing period and upon filing such statement the registrant shall pay an inspection fee.  If the tonnage report is not filed and the payment of inspection fees is not made within 30 days after the end of the specified filing period, a collection fee, amounting to 10 percent (minimum $10) of the amount due, shall be assessed against the registrant and added to the amount due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When more than one person is involved in the distribution of a fertilizer, the last person who has the fertilizer registered and who distributed to a nonregistrant dealer or consumer is responsible for reporting the tonnage and paying the inspection fee, unless the report and payment is made by a prior distributor of the fertilizer.

IV. Fees collected under this section shall be deposited with the state treasurer into the general fund as unrestricted revenue.

<center><h3>Section 431:7</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 431:7 Inspection, Sampling, and Analysis. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be the duty of the commissioner to sample, inspect, make analyses of, and test fertilizers distributed within this state at any time and place and to such an extent as the commissioner may deem necessary to determine whether such fertilizers are in compliance with the provisions of this subdivision.  The commissioner is authorized to enter upon any public or private premises or carriers during regular business hours in order to access fertilizer subject to provisions of this subdivision and the rules adopted pursuant to it, and the records relating to their distribution and storage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The methods of sampling and analysis shall be those adopted by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC).  In cases not covered by such methods, or in cases where methods are available in which improved applicability has been demonstrated, the commissioner may adopt by rule such appropriate methods from other sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner, in determining for administrative purposes whether any fertilizer is deficient in plant food, shall be guided solely by the official sample as defined in RSA 431:3, and obtained and analyzed as provided for in paragraph II of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The results of official analysis of fertilizers and portions of official samples shall be distributed by the commissioner as provided by rule.  Official samples establishing a penalty for nutrient deficiency shall be retained for a minimum of 90 days from issuance of a deficiency report.

<center><h3>Section 431:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 431:8 Plant Food Deficiency. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When the official analysis under RSA 431:7 shall show that a fertilizer is deficient in nitrogen, available phosphate, and/or soluble potash in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b), then a penalty payment of 3 times the value of such deficiency shall be assessed.  When a fertilizer is subject to a penalty payment under both (a) and (b), the larger penalty payment shall apply.  A fertilizer is deficient when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) One or more of its guaranteed primary plant nutrients are beyond the investigational allowances established by rule;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The overall index value of the fertilizer is below the level established by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Penalty payments for deficiencies beyond the investigational allowances as established by rule for any other constituent covered under RSA 431:5, I(c)(2), which the registrant is required to or may guarantee, shall be evaluated and penalty payments prescribed by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All penalty payments assessed under this section shall be paid by the registrant to the commissioner within 3 months of receiving written notification from the commissioner of the penalty notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Penalty payments received from the registrant shall be refunded to the consumer of the fertilizer which has been analyzed and found deficient, provided that the purchase is of one ton or more.  Penalty payments on lots of fertilizer which have been analyzed and found deficient and whose purchaser cannot be found shall be deposited in the general fund as unrestricted revenue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If, upon satisfactory evidence, a person is shown to have altered the content of a fertilizer shipped to such person by a registrant, or to have mixed or commingled fertilizer from 2 or more suppliers such that the result of either alteration changes the analysis of the fertilizer as originally guaranteed, then that person shall become responsible for obtaining a registration and shall be held liable for all penalty payments and be subject to other provisions of this subdivision, including seizure, condemnation, and stop sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A deficiency in an official sample of mixed fertilizer resulting from nonuniformity is not distinguishable from a deficiency due to actual plant nutrient shortage and is properly subject to official action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent any person from appealing to a court of competent jurisdiction seeking judgment as to the justification of such penalty payments.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

When the commissioner finds, after public hearing following due notice under rules adopted by the commissioner under RSA 541-A, that the requirement for expressing the calcium and magnesium in elemental form would not impose an economic hardship on distributors and users of agricultural liming materials by reason of conflicting label requirements among the states, the commissioner may require by rule that the minimum percentage of calcium oxide and magnesium oxide and/or calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate shall be expressed in the following form:
