<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Agricultural liming materials sold, offered, or exposed for sale in the state shall have affixed to the outside of each package in a conspicuous manner, a plainly printed, stamped, or otherwise marked label, tag or statement, or in the case of bulk sales, a delivery slip, setting forth at least the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name and principal office address of the manufacturer or distributor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The brand or trade name of the material.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The identification of the product as to the type of the agricultural liming material.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The net weight of the agricultural liming material.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The minimum percentage of calcium oxide and magnesium oxide and/or calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The calcium carbonate equivalent as determined by methods prescribed by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) International.  Minimum calcium carbonate equivalents shall be as prescribed by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The minimum percent by weight passing through U.S. Standards sieves as prescribed by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No information or statement shall appear on any package, label, delivery slip, or advertising matter which is false or misleading to the purchaser as to the quality, analysis, type, or composition of the agricultural liming material.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of any material which has been adulterated subsequent to packaging, labeling or loading and before delivery to the consumer, a plainly marked notice to that effect shall be affixed by the vendor to the package or delivery slip to identify the kind and degree of such adulteration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. At every site from which agricultural liming materials are delivered in bulk and at every place where consumer orders for bulk deliveries are placed, there shall be conspicuously posted a copy of the statement required by this section for each brand of material.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When the commissioner finds, after public hearing following due notice under rules adopted by the commissioner under RSA 541-A, that the requirement for expressing the calcium and magnesium in elemental form would not impose an economic hardship on distributors and users of agricultural liming materials by reason of conflicting label requirements among the states, the commissioner may require by rule that the minimum percentage of calcium oxide and magnesium oxide and/or calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate shall be expressed in the following form:
<PRE>
 Total Calcium (Ca) .................. percent
 Total Magnesium (Mg) .................. percent
</PRE>
<br>
The effective date of such a rule shall be not less than 6 months following the adoption of the rule, and for a period of 2 years following the effective date of the rule, the equivalent of calcium and magnesium may also be shown in the form of calcium oxide and magnesium oxide and/or calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.
