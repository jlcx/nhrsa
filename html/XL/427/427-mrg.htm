&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 427:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Meat and meat food products are an important source of the nation's total supply of food.  It is essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged.  Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat food products are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged meat and meat food products, and result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat food products, as well as injury to consumers.  The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally.  It is hereby found that regulation by the commissioner and cooperation by this state and the United States as contemplated by this subdivision are appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise effectuate the purposes of this subdivision.
