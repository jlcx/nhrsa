&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 53-F:8 Priority;  Collection and Enforcement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Collection of assessments under this chapter shall be made by the tax collector or other official responsible for property tax or municipal service charge collection.  A municipality shall commit bills for amounts due on the assessments, including interest and any charges, to the tax collector with a warrant signed by the appropriate municipal officials requiring the tax collector to collect them.  Each year bills for amounts due on the assessments shall coincide with bills for property taxes or municipal service charges.  Each assessment on the property of a participating property owner shall create a lien on the property pursuant to RSA 80:19, except that the lien shall be junior to existing liens of record at the time the bill for the assessment is mailed to the participating property owner.  Enforcement powers for nonpayment shall be those provided under RSA 80 relative to property tax collection, including RSA 80:19;  provided, however, a tax sale of the property shall not extinguish prior liens of record.  At the time of enforcement, only the past due balances of the assessment under this chapter, including all interest, charges, and penalties, shall be due for payment.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the event of a transfer of property ownership through foreclosure or a sheriff's sale by a senior lienor, the lien of the municipality shall be extinguished.  Payment of a past due balance from the loss reserve established under this chapter shall not relieve a participating property owner from the obligation to pay that amount.
