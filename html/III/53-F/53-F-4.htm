<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) A municipality may make an assessment under this chapter only pursuant to an agreement entered into with the free and willing consent of the owner of the property to which the assessment applies.  In the case of any property with multiple owners, an agreement under this chapter shall be signed by all owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An agreement with a property owner shall provide that the owner shall contract for qualifying improvements with one or more qualified contractors, purchase materials to be used in making qualified improvements, or both, and that, upon submission of documentation required by the municipality, the municipality shall disburse funds to those contractors and vendors in payment for the qualifying improvements or materials used in making qualified improvements.  An agreement with a property owner shall require that the property owner report post-installation energy use data for program evaluation purposes over a period determined by the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The agreement shall be in writing and shall include a payment schedule showing the term over which payments will be due on the assessment, the frequency with which payments will be billed and amount of each payment, and the annual amount due on the assessment.  Upon full payment of the amount of the assessment, including all outstanding interest and charges and any penalties that may become due, the municipality shall provide the participating property owner with a written statement certifying that the assessment has been paid in full.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The municipality shall disclose to participating property owners the risks associated with participating in the program, including risks related to their failure to make payments and the risk of enforcement of property tax or special assessment liens under RSA 53-F:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At least 30 days prior to entering into an agreement with a municipality under this chapter, the property owner shall provide to the holders of any existing mortgages on the property notice of his or her intent to enter into the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The municipality shall file a notice of the assessment under this chapter for recording in the county registry of deeds.  The notice shall consist of the following statement or its substantial equivalent:  "This property is subject to a special assessment related to the installation of qualifying cost-effective energy conservation and efficiency improvements or clean energy improvements under RSA 53-F.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any personal financial information provided to a municipality or an entity administering a program under this chapter on behalf of a municipality by a participating property owner or potential participating property owner shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person except as required to administer the program and only on a need-to-know basis.
