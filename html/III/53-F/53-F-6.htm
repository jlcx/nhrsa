&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 53-F:6 Qualifying Improvements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Improvements financed pursuant to an agreement under this chapter shall be based upon an audit performed by a person who has been certified as a building analyst by the Building Performance Institute or who has obtained other appropriate certification as determined by the public utilities commission or another appropriate New Hampshire-based entity.  The audit shall identify recommended energy conservation and efficiency and clean energy improvements;  provide the estimated energy cost savings, useful life, benefit-cost ratio, and simple payback or return on investment for each improvement;  and provide the estimated overall difference in annual energy costs with and without recommended improvements.  Financed improvements shall be consistent with the audit recommendations.  The cost of the audit may be included in the total amount financed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Improvements shall be permanently affixed to an existing building or facility that is part of the eligible property.  The owner of the property may not finance projects in buildings or facilities under new construction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Improvements shall be made by a contractor or contractors, which may include a cooperative or not-for-profit organization, determined by the municipality to be qualified to make the energy efficiency or clean energy improvements in the agreement.  Contractors may be designated as qualified by an electric or gas utility program or another appropriate New Hampshire-based entity.  Any work requiring a license under any applicable law shall be performed by an individual holding such license.  A municipality may elect to permit the financing pursuant to an agreement under this chapter of improvements made by the owner of the property, but shall not permit the value of the owner's labor to be included in the amount financed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Prior to disbursement of final payments to any contractor or vendor pursuant to an agreement with a property owner, submission is required by the property owner in a form acceptable to the municipality of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A post-installation report, based on an independent inspection acceptable to the municipality, certifying that improvements have been installed properly and verifying that they are performing satisfactorily;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Documentation of all costs to be financed and copies of any required permits.
