An agreement with a property owner shall require that the property owner report post-installation energy use data for program evaluation purposes over a period determined by the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The agreement shall be in writing and shall include a payment schedule showing the term over which payments will be due on the assessment, the frequency with which payments will be billed and amount of each payment, and the annual amount due on the assessment.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The municipality shall disclose to participating property owners the risks associated with participating in the program, including risks related to their failure to make payments and the risk of enforcement of property tax or special assessment liens under RSA 53-F:8.

IV. The municipality shall file a notice of the assessment under this chapter for recording in the county registry of deeds.  The notice shall consist of the following statement or its substantial equivalent:  "This property is subject to a special assessment related to the installation of qualifying cost-effective energy conservation and efficiency improvements or clean energy improvements under RSA 53-F.''

The municipality shall adopt additional criteria, appropriate to property-assessed clean energy finance programs, for determining the creditworthiness of property owners.  The municipality shall determine whether any mortgages or liens of record exist in the registry of deeds on the property and whether they are current in the obligations.  If any such mortgage or lien exists, the municipality shall notify each such mortgagee or lienholder in writing that it is considering making a loan secured by a municipal lien pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and request the consent of each such mortgagee or lienholder to the making of such loan.  Each mortgagee or lienholder shall have the right to determine in its sole discretion whether or not it will consent to such loan.  If all of the mortgagees or lienholders of record elect to consent, the consents shall be in writing and recorded with the municipal lien in the registry of deeds.  The legal effect of having all consents shall be that the municipal lien shall not be extinguished in the event of a foreclosure or sheriff's sale by the mortgagee or lienholder as provided in RSA 53-F:8.  If all of the mortgagees or lienholders of record do not consent, but the municipality determines that it will proceed in making such loan, then in the event of a foreclosure or sheriff's sale by a mortgagee or lienholder, the municipal lien shall be extinguished.  Special assessment liens held by municipalities plus existing mortgages shall not exceed $1,000,000 or 35 percent of the assessed value of the building and property, whichever is greater.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 53-F:6 Qualifying Improvements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Improvements financed pursuant to an agreement under this chapter shall be based upon an audit performed by a person who has been certified as a building analyst by the Building Performance Institute or who has obtained other appropriate certification as determined by the public utilities commission or another appropriate New Hampshire-based entity.  The audit shall identify recommended energy conservation and efficiency and clean energy improvements;  provide the estimated energy cost savings, useful life, benefit-cost ratio, and simple payback or return on investment for each improvement;  and provide the estimated overall difference in annual energy costs with and without recommended improvements.  Financed improvements shall be consistent with the audit recommendations.  The cost of the audit may be included in the total amount financed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Improvements shall be permanently affixed to an existing building or facility that is part of the property.  An agreement between a municipality and a qualifying property owner may not cover projects in buildings or facilities under new construction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Improvements shall be made by a contractor or contractors, which may include a cooperative or not-for-profit organization, determined by the municipality to be qualified to make the energy efficiency or clean energy improvements in the agreement.  A municipality may accept a designation of contractors as qualified made by an electric or gas utility program or another appropriate New Hampshire-based entity.  Any work requiring a license under any applicable law shall be performed by an individual holding such license.  A municipality may elect to permit the financing pursuant to an agreement under this chapter of improvements made by the owner of the property, but shall not permit the value of the owner's labor to be included in the amount financed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A municipality shall require, prior to disbursement of final payments to any contractor or vendor pursuant to an agreement with a property owner, submission by the property owner in a form acceptable to the municipality of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A post-installation report, based on an independent inspection acceptable to the municipality, certifying that improvements have been installed properly and verifying that they are performing satisfactorily;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Documentation of all costs to be financed and copies of any required permits.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Improvements shall be financed pursuant to an agreement under this chapter only on terms such that the property owner experiences a positive cash flow impact during the first year and the total energy cost savings realized by the property owner and the property owner's successors during the useful lives of the improvements are expected to exceed the total cost to the property owner and the property owner's successors of the improvements.  In determining the amount that may be financed pursuant to an agreement under this chapter, the total amount of all rebates, tax credits, grants, and other financial assistance received by the owner on account of the improvements shall be deducted from the cost of the improvements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A municipality that provides financing to participating property owners shall establish a loss reserve account and maintain funds in such account at a level that meets generally accepted standards for property-assessed clean energy finance programs.  Funds in a loss reserve account shall not be provided from general municipal revenues.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The total amount of assessments for a property under this chapter shall not be less than $5,000 and shall not exceed $35,000 in the case of a single-family residential property or $60,000 in the case of a commercial, industrial, or multifamily residential property, or 15 percent of the assessed value of the property multiplied by the municipality's current equalization ratio, whichever is less.  The combined amount of assessments under this chapter, any outstanding mortgage obligations for the property, and any other outstanding debt attached to the property shall not exceed 85 percent of the assessed value of the property multiplied by the municipality's current equalization ratio.  A property owner who escrows property taxes with the holder of a mortgage on a property subject to an agreement under this chapter may be required by the holder to escrow amounts due on the assessment under this chapter and the mortgage holder shall remit such amounts to the municipality in the manner that property taxes are escrowed and remitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The maximum term of finance provided pursuant to an agreement under this chapter shall be 20 years.  The term shall in no case exceed 85 percent of the average expected useful life of all improvements, weighted by cost.  Expected useful lives used for all calculations under this chapter shall be consistent with the expected useful lives of energy conservation and efficiency and clean energy measures approved by the public utilities commission for utility or other programs.
