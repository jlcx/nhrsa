&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 53-F:2 Adoption by Municipality. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A city, town, or village district may adopt the provisions of this chapter in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In a town, other than a town that has adopted a charter pursuant to RSA 49-D, the question shall be placed on the warrant of an annual meeting only by the governing body, and not pursuant to RSA 39:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In a city or a town that has adopted a charter pursuant to RSA 49-C or RSA 49-D, the legislative body may consider and act upon the question in accordance with its normal procedures for passage of resolutions, ordinances, and other legislation.  In the alternative, the legislative body of any such municipality may vote to place the question on the official ballot for any regular municipal election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In a village district, the question may be considered and acted upon by any means authorized by RSA 52.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The language of the question shall designate an energy efficiency and clean energy district, which may cover all or a portion of the area within the municipality, or may designate all or a portion of the area within the municipality as part of an energy efficiency and clean energy district that encompasses all or portions of multiple municipalities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A municipality may vote to rescind its action in the same manner as it may vote to adopt, provided that all agreements entered into with property owners and related legal obligations created prior to its vote to rescind shall remain in effect.
