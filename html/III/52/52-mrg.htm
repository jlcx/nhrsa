In the case of districts with annual budgets of $200,000 or more, the town treasurer shall distribute the amount of taxes collected and held in trust by the town under paragraph I by distributing to the district treasurer all taxes collected in any given calendar month by the end of the next following month, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the town and district treasurers.  The town treasurer, furthermore, shall turn over to the district treasurer all interest earned on district tax revenues held in trust by the town and all interest collected by the town on the account of any delinquent district taxpayers' district taxes in the same manner as the tax revenues are distributed.

Any village district and any district now in existence having the rights and powers of a village district, may, at an annual meeting, by a  2/3 vote of its legal voters, terminate its existence and dispose of its corporate property.  Upon the dissolution of any such district, the property, real and personal, which is contained within the former boundaries of the dissolved district shall continue to be subject to taxation and betterment assessments for the purpose of paying any unpaid bonds, notes, bills or other obligations incurred while the district was in existence, in the same manner as if the said district had not been dissolved.  The selectmen of the town or towns in which the district was situated shall assess the taxes and betterment assessments in the same manner as if the district had not been dissolved and shall have the duty, authority, and power to pay such bonds, notes, bills or other obligations after the moneys received from such taxes and assessments.  Provided, however, that in no case shall the total of any such taxes or assessment exceed the balance necessary to pay said bonds, notes, bills or other obligations after the net income derived from the property disposed of has been applied for the payment of the same.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 52:23 Public Water. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon the written application of 10 percent of the registered voters in any village water district, presented to the commissioners or one of them at least 15 days before the day prescribed for an annual meeting of the district, the commissioners shall insert in their warrant for such meeting an article relative to the use of fluoride in the water system for said district, and the district clerk shall prepare a ballot for said meeting with the following question:  "Shall fluoride be used in the district water system?'' Beside the question shall be printed the word "yes'' and the word "no'' with the proper boxes for the voter to indicate his or her choice.  If a majority of those voting in a water system that serves only one municipality does not approve the use of fluoride in the district water system, no fluoride shall be introduced into the district water system;  or if fluoride has, prior to said vote, been so introduced, such use shall be discontinued until such time as the majority of those voting in the town approve of the use of fluoride.  After such popular referendum, the commissioners shall not insert an article relative to the use of fluoride in the district water system in the warrant nor shall the district clerk prepare such a ballot for a minimum period of 3 years from the date of the last popular referendum of the district and only upon written application at that time of not less than 10 percent of the registered voters of said district.  The procedure for a referendum on the use of fluoride in a village district that is part of a water system serving more than one municipality shall be the procedure in RSA 485:14-a.
