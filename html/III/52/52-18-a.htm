<codesect>
Any district which shall have received an order by the department of environmental services under the provisions of RSA 147, 485, or 485-A shall proceed forthwith to acquire whatever easements and lands as are necessary to comply with said order provided that a majority of the voters vote in favor of said acquisition at any regular or special district meeting called for the purpose of taking action on such order and may enter upon, for the purpose of survey leading to land description, any land within the town or towns in which such district is situated.  In so proceeding the district commissioners or other duly authorized agents shall institute any necessary land taking in accordance with the provisions of RSA 52:18 and, anything contained in RSA 231 or in the statutes generally notwithstanding, the decision of the commissioners of the town or towns in which such land or lands are situated shall not be vacated and any subsequent appeal or other action by the owner or owners shall be based solely on the amount of damages assessed, and the duly appointed agents of the district shall have full right of immediate entry for the purposes of detailed surveys, borings, or the conduct of any and all other actions necessary or desirable to aid the district in implementation of the order by the department of environmental services.
