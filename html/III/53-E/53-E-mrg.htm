<center><h3>Section 53-E:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 53-E:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds it to be in the public interest to allow municipalities and counties to aggregate retail electric customers, as necessary, to provide such customers access to competitive markets for supplies of electricity and related energy services.  The general court finds that aggregation may provide small customers with similar opportunities to those available to larger customers in obtaining lower electric costs, reliable service, and secure energy supplies.  The purpose of aggregation shall be to encourage voluntary, cost effective and innovative solutions to local needs with careful consideration of local conditions and opportunities.
