Every governmental unit is hereby authorized and empowered to borrow money from the bank evidenced by its municipal bonds purchased by the bank and to contract with the bank with respect to such borrowing or purchase.  Every governmental unit is hereby authorized and empowered to pay fees and charges required to be paid to the bank for its services.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or statute applicable to or constituting any limitation on the sale of bonds or notes, any governmental unit may sell its bonds or notes to the bank without limitation as to denomination, and such bonds or notes may be fully registered, registrable as to principal or in bearer form, may bear interest at such rate or rates, may be evidenced in such manner and may contain other provisions not inconsistent herewith, and may be sold to the bank without advertisement, all as shall be determined or authorized to be determined in respect of the foregoing or other matters by the officers of the governmental unit authorized by law to provide for the sale of such bonds or notes.  In case any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds or notes shall cease to be officers before the delivery of the bonds or notes, such signatures shall be valid or sufficient for all purposes, the same as if they had remained in office.
