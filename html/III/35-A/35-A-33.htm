&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 35-A:33 Application of Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Money or investments in any fund or account of the bank established or held for any bonds, notes, indebtedness or liability to be paid, funded or refunded by issuance of bonds or notes shall, unless the resolution authorizing such bonds or notes provides otherwise, be applied to the payment or retirement of any such bonds, notes, indebtedness or liability, and to no other purpose.  In the event that there shall be in any such fund or account any moneys in excess of the amount required for such payment, funding or refunding, such moneys may be removed from such fund or account but only to the extent that the moneys or investments thereafter remaining in such fund or account shall be not less than the outstanding bonds, notes, indebtedness or liability of the bank to be paid, funded or refunded and for which such fund or account was established or held.
