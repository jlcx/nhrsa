In case any of the members, executive director or officers of the bank whose signatures appear on any notes or bonds or coupons shall cease to be such members, executive director or officers before the delivery of such notes or bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such members, executive director or officers had remained in office until such delivery.

Unless provided otherwise in any contract between the bank and the holders of notes, and unless such notes shall have been otherwise paid, funded or refunded, the proceeds of any bonds of the bank issued among other things, to fund such outstanding notes, shall be held, used and applied by the bank to the payment and retirement of the principal of such notes and the interest due and payable thereon.

The proceeds of any such bonds or notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds or notes, may, in the discretion of the bank, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds or notes either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the bank.  Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested, subject to any agreements with note or bondholders, in such manner as the bank shall determine, maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, on the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded.
