&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 35-A:1 Declaration of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared to be in the public interest and to be the policy of the state to foster and promote by all reasonable means the provision of adequate markets and facilities for borrowing money by governmental units, as defined herein, for the financing of their public improvements and other municipal purposes from proceeds of bonds or notes issued by such governmental units, and to assist such governmental units in fulfilling their needs for such purposes by creation of indebtedness and to the extent possible to encourage continued investor interest in the bonds or notes of such governmental units as sound and preferred securities for investment.  It is in the public interest and it is the policy of the state to encourage its governmental units to continue their independent undertakings of public improvements and new municipal purposes and the financing thereof and to assist them therein by making funds available at reduced interest costs for orderly financing of such public improvements and other municipal purposes, particularly for those governmental units not otherwise able readily to borrow for such purposes at reasonable rates of interest.  It is further declared that credit and municipal bond market conditions require the exercise of the powers of the state in the interest of its governmental units to further and implement such policies by authorizing a state instrumentality to be created as a body corporate and politic to have full powers to borrow money and to issue its bonds and notes to make funds available through the facilities of such instrumentality at reduced rates and on more favorable terms for borrowing by such governmental units through the purchase by such instrumentality of the bonds or notes of such governmental units in fully marketable form and by granting broad powers to such instrumentality to accomplish and to carry out the aforesaid policies of the state which are in the public interest of the state and of its taxpayers and residents.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 35-A:4 New Hampshire Municipal Bond Bank Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established a public body corporate and politic having a distinct legal existence separate from the state and not constituting a department or agency of the state government to be known as the New Hampshire municipal bond bank.  The bank is hereby constituted as an instrumentality exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the bank of the powers conferred by this chapter shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The bank shall consist of 5 directors.  The state treasurer shall be an ex officio member without further appointment.  Four directors shall be appointed by the governor and council for terms of 5 years each.  Of these 4 directors, one shall be a designee of the New Hampshire Municipal Association.  At least 2 of the appointed directors shall have backgrounds in public finance.  Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.  Each director shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and qualified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each member of the board of directors of the bank, before entering upon his duties, shall take an oath to administer the duties of his office as such faithfully and impartially, and such oath shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state.  Directors may be removed from office by the governor and council, for cause after a public hearing, and may be suspended by the governor and council pending the completion of such hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board of directors shall annually elect one of its members as chairman and another as vice chairman.  The directors shall elect a secretary and a treasurer who need not be directors, and the same person may be elected to serve both as secretary and as treasurer.  The powers of the bank shall be vested in the directors thereof in office from time to time and 3 directors of the bank shall constitute a quorum at any meeting thereof.  Action may be taken and motions and resolutions adopted by the bank at any meeting thereof by the affirmative vote of at least 3 directors of the bank.  No vacancy in the directorship of the bank shall impair the right of a quorum of the directors to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Before the issuance of any bonds or notes under the provisions of this chapter, each director of the bank, and the executive director, if one is employed, shall execute a surety bond in the penal sum of $50,000 and the treasurer of the bank shall execute a surety bond in the penal sum of $100,000, or in lieu thereof the chairman of the bank shall execute a blanket bond covering each member, the treasurer and other officers and employees of the bank, each such surety bond to be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office covered, to be executed by a surety company authorized to transact business in the state of New Hampshire as surety and to be approved by the attorney general and filed in the office of the secretary of state.  All costs of such surety bonds shall be borne by the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The directors of the bank shall serve without compensation, but the bank shall reimburse its directors for actual expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of their duties.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, no officer or employee of the state shall be deemed to have forfeited or shall forfeit his office or employment or any benefits or emoluments thereof by reason of his acceptance of the office of director of the bank or his services therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The bank may appoint and employ an executive director, a general counsel, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors or experts and all such other or different officers, agents and employees as it may require and determine their qualifications, terms of office, duties and compensation, all without regard to the provisions of RSA 98.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, it shall not be nor shall it constitute a conflict of interest for a director, officer or employee of any governmental unit, financial institution, investment banking firm, brokerage firm, commercial bank or trust company, insurance company or any other firm, person or corporation to serve as a member of the bank.  If any member of the bank shall be interested either directly or indirectly or shall be a director, officer or employee of or have an ownership interest in any firm or corporation interested directly or indirectly in any contract with the bank, including any loan to any governmental unit, such interest shall be disclosed to the bank and shall be set forth in the minutes of the bank and the member having such interest therein shall not participate on behalf of the bank in any proceedings relating to the authorization of any such contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The bank and its corporate existence shall continue until terminated by law, provided, however, that no such law shall take effect so long as the bank shall have bonds, notes and other obligations outstanding, unless adequate provision has been made for the payment thereof.  Upon termination of the existence of the bank, all its rights and properties shall pass to and be vested in the state.  No net earnings of the bank may inure to the benefit of any person, entity or body other than the state.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 35-A:11 Reserve Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The bank may create and establish one or more special funds, hereafter referred to as "bond reserve funds'', and shall pay into each such bond reserve fund any monies appropriated and made available by the state for the purpose of such fund;  any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions of the bank authorizing the issuance thereof;  and any other monies which may be available to the bank for the purpose of such fund from any other source or sources.  All monies held in any bond reserve fund are hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds with respect to which such bond reserve fund may be established, as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided.  Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made and the revenues, monies or property so pledged subject to RSA 35-A:10.  The use and disposition of monies to the credit of such bond reserve fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement.  Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such bond reserve fund shall be a fund for all such bonds issued pursuant to a particular resolution to provide financing for governmental units without distinction or priority of any bond over another.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Monies in any bond reserve fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such fund to less than the bond reserve fund requirement established for such fund, as provided in paragraph IV, except for the purpose of making, with respect to bonds secured in whole or in part by such fund, payment when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums and the sinking fund payments, if any, with respect to such bonds for the payment of which other moneys of the bank are not available.  Any income or interest earned by any bond reserve fund resulting from the investment thereof or any other moneys therein may be transferred by the bank to other funds or accounts of the bank to the extent it does not reduce the amount of that bond reserve fund below the bond reserve fund requirements for such fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The bank shall not at any time issue bonds, secured in whole or in part by a bond reserve fund, if upon the issuance of such bonds, the amount in such bond reserve fund will be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for such fund, unless the bank at the time of issuance of such bonds shall deposit in such fund from the proceeds of the bonds issued, or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in such fund, will not be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for such fund.  The bank may at any time issue its bonds or notes for the purpose of providing any amount necessary to increase the amount in the reserve fund to the required debt service reserve, or to meet such higher or additional reserve as may be fixed by the bank with respect to such fund.  In computing the amount of the required debt service reserve, investments held as a part thereof shall be valued in the manner provided in the bond resolution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. As used herein "bond reserve fund requirement'' means, as of any date of computation, the amount or amounts required to be on deposit in the reserve fund as provided by resolution of the bank authorizing such bonds, provided that required bond reserve fund requirement with respect to bonds authorized by resolution of the bank adopted before January 1, 1988, shall be as of any date of computation, an aggregate amount equal to at least the largest amount of money, required by the terms of all contracts between the bank and its bondholders to be raised in the then current or any succeeding calendar year for the payment of interest on and maturing principal of that portion of outstanding bonds the proceeds of which were applied solely to the purchase of municipal securities and sinking fund payments required by the terms of any such contracts to sinking funds established for the payment or redemption of such bonds, all calculated on the assumption that bonds will cease to be outstanding after the date of such computation by reason of the payment of such bonds at their respective maturities and the payments of such required moneys to sinking funds and the application thereof in accordance with the terms of all such contracts to the retirement of bonds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Moneys at any time in the reserve fund may be invested in the same manner as permitted for investment of funds belonging to the state or held in the treasury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The bank may provide by resolution authorizing an issue of bonds that is secured in whole or in part by a bond reserve fund that, in lieu of the deposit of moneys in a bond reserve fund, the bond reserve fund requirement for such issue may be met in whole or in part by insurance, letter or line of credit or other credit facility that will be available for the purposes of the bond reserve fund as specified in such resolution of the bank.  The chairman of the bank shall include in the written request for an appropriation required by RSA 35-A:12, I, the amount, if any, required to reimburse the payor under any insurance policy, letter or line of credit or other credit facility for sums paid by such payor for purposes of the bond reserve fund.
