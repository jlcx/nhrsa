<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If no regional planning commission exists in any specific planning region as delineated by the office of energy and planning, then 2 or more municipalities in said planning region and having planning boards may, by ordinance or resolution adopted by the respective legislative bodies of said municipalities, form a regional planning commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a regional planning commission already exists in any specific planning region as delineated by the office of energy and planning, then any municipality in said planning region and having a planning board may, by ordinance or resolution adopted by the respective legislative body of said municipality, become a member of the regional planning commission.  A regional planning commission may also include municipalities located in an adjacent state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each municipality which shall become a member of a regional planning commission shall be entitled to 2 representatives on said commission.  A municipality with a population of over 10,000 but less than 25,000 shall be entitled to have 3 representatives on said commission and a municipality with a population of over 25,000 shall be entitled to have 4 representatives on said commission.  Population as set forth in this section shall be deemed to be determined by the last federal census.  Representatives to a regional planning commission shall be nominated by the planning board of each municipality from the residents thereof and shall be appointed by the municipal officers of each municipality.  Representatives may be elected or appointed officials of the municipality or county.  In any county or counties in which a regional planning commission has been formed, the county may, by resolution of its county commissioners, become a member of said regional planning commission and shall be entitled to appoint 2 representatives on said commission.  The terms of office of members of a regional planning commission shall be for 4 years, but initial appointments shall be for 2 and 4 years.  In municipalities entitled to 3 or more representatives, initial appointment shall be for 2, 3 and 4 years.  Vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term in the same manner as original appointments.  Municipalities and counties may also appoint alternate representatives.  A representative to a regional planning commission shall, when acting within the scope of his official duties and authority, be deemed to be acting as an agent of both the regional planning commission and of the municipality or county which he represents.  In addition, regional planning commissions are encouraged to consult, at their discretion, with agencies and institutions operating within the region whose activities influence planning and development in that region.
