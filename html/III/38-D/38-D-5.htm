&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A town or city, having established an energy commission, may appropriate money as necessary for the purpose of this chapter.  All or any part of money so appropriated in any year and any gifts of money received under this chapter may be placed in an energy commission fund and allowed to accumulate from year to year.  Money may be expended from such fund by the energy commission for the purposes of this chapter without further approval of the town meeting;  however, acceptance of gifts over $500 and disbursements over $500 shall require a public hearing with notice under RSA 675:7 and approval of the governing body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The town treasurer, under RSA 41:29, shall have custody of all moneys in the energy fund and shall pay out the same only upon order of the energy commission.  The disbursement of energy commission funds following the approval required under paragraph I shall be authorized by a majority of the energy commission.
