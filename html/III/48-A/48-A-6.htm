&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 48-A:6 Lien. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever the public agency shall incur cost for the repair, alteration, improvement, vacating or closing, or for the removal or demolition of a dwelling, pursuant to an order of the superior court, the amount of such costs shall be a lien against the real property as to which such cost was incurred and such lien, including as part thereof upon allowance of his costs and necessary attorneys' fees, may be foreclosed upon order of the superior court made pursuant to a petition for that purpose filed in said court.  Such lien shall be subordinate to mortgages of record made before the institution of proceedings under this chapter.  Notice of said lien shall be filed with the register of deeds for the county in which the real estate is situated, and shall be recorded by him.  If the dwelling is demolished by the public agency, he shall sell the materials of such dwelling and pay the proceeds of such sale over to the superior court, for distribution to such persons as the court shall find entitled thereto.
