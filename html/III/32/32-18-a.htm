&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any municipality electing this subdivision, or any district wholly within a town electing this subdivision, if a bond request is not recommended in its entirety by the budget committee, the governing body of such municipality, after a majority vote by the governing body of the municipality in favor of the bond request at a duly posted meeting, shall place the bond request on the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislative body of any municipality described in RSA 32:18-a, I, may approve a bond request despite the 10 percent limitation provided in RSA 32:18 in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The governing body shall place the following statement at the beginning of the warrant article for such bond request:  "Passage of this article shall override the 10 percent limitation imposed on this appropriation due to the non-recommendation of the budget committee.''  Immediately below the bond request on the warrant shall be displayed (1) the recommendation of the governing body and (2) the recommendation of the budget committee, as included in the budget forms for the annual meeting pursuant to RSA 32:5, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If those voting "Yes'' on the bond request satisfy the requirements of RSA 33:8, the bond request is thereby approved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the bond request is approved pursuant to RSA 32:18-a, the governing body of such municipality shall forward a copy of the minutes of the duly posted meeting described in RSA 32:18-a, I to the commissioner of the department of revenue administration.
