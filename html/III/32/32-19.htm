&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 32:19 Collective Bargaining Agreements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever items or portions of items in a proposed budget constitute appropriations, the purpose of which is to implement cost items of a collective bargaining agreement negotiated pursuant to RSA 273-A, either previously ratified or concurrently being submitted for ratification by the legislative body, or the purpose of which is to implement the recommendations of a neutral party in the case of a dispute, as provided in RSA 273-A:12, such items shall be submitted to the budget committee and considered in its budget preparation.  Such appropriations shall be submitted to the legislative body and shall include a statement of the governing body's recommendation and a separate statement of the budget committee's recommendation. If such appropriations were not recommended by the budget committee, then such appropriations shall be exempt from the 10 percent limitation set forth in RSA 32:18.  The failure of the budget committee to recommend any portion of such appropriations shall not be deemed an unfair labor practice under RSA 273-A.
