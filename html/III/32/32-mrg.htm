<center><h3>Section 32:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 32:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The purpose of this chapter is to clarify the law as it existed under former RSA 32.  A town or district may establish a municipal budget committee to assist its voters in the prudent appropriation of public funds.  The budget committee, in those municipalities which establish one, is intended to have budgetary authority analogous to that of a legislative appropriations committee.  It is the legislature's further purpose to establish uniformity in the manner of appropriating and spending public funds in all municipal subdivisions to which this chapter applies, including those towns, school districts and village districts which do not operate with budget committees, and have not before had much statutory guidance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 32:5 Budget Preparation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governing body, or the budget committee if there is one, shall hold at least one public hearing on each budget, not later than 25 days before each annual or special meeting, public notice of which shall be given at least 7 days in advance, and after the conclusion of public testimony shall finalize the budget to be submitted to the legislative body.  One or more supplemental public hearings may be held at any time before the annual or special meeting, subject to the 7-day notice requirement.  If the first hearing or any supplemental hearing is recessed to a later date or time, additional notice shall not be required for a supplemental session if the date, time, and place of the supplemental session are made known at the original hearing.  Public hearings on bonds and notes in excess of $100,000 shall be held in accordance with RSA 33:8-a, I.  Days shall be counted in accordance with RSA 21:35.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All purposes and amounts of appropriations to be included in the budget or special warrant articles shall be disclosed or discussed at the final hearing.  The governing body or budget committee shall not thereafter insert, in any budget column or special warrant article, an additional amount or purpose of appropriation which was not disclosed or discussed at that hearing, without first holding one or more public hearings on supplemental budget requests for town or district expenditures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All appropriations recommended shall be stipulated on a "gross'' basis, showing anticipated revenues from all sources, including grants, gifts, bequests, and bond issues, which shall be shown as offsetting revenues to appropriations affected.  The budget shall be prepared according to rules adopted by the commissioner of revenue administration under RSA 541-A, relative to the required forms and information to be submitted for recommended appropriations and anticipated revenues for each town or district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Budget forms for the annual meeting shall include, in the section showing recommended appropriations, comparative columns indicating at least the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Appropriations voted by the previous annual meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Actual expenditures made pursuant to those appropriations, or in those towns and districts which hold annual meetings prior to the close of the current fiscal year, actual expenditures for the most recently completed fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All appropriations, including appropriations contained in special warrant articles, recommended by the governing body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If there is a budget committee, all the appropriations, including appropriations contained in special warrant articles, recommended by the budget committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When any purpose of appropriation, submitted by a governing body or by petition, appears in the warrant as part of a special warrant article:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The article shall contain a notation of whether or not that appropriation is recommended by the governing body, and, if there is a budget committee, a notation of whether or not it is recommended by the budget committee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the article is amended at the first session of the meeting in an official ballot referendum municipality, the governing body and the budget committee, if one exists, may revise its recommendation on the amended version of the special warrant article and the revised recommendation shall appear on the ballot for the second session of the meeting provided, however, that the 10 percent limitation on expenditures provided for in RSA 32:18 shall be calculated based upon the initial recommendations of the budget committee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Defects or deficiencies in these notations shall not affect the legal validity of any appropriation otherwise lawfully made;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) All appropriations made under special warrant articles shall be subject to the hearing requirements of paragraphs I and II of this section.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph V-a effective until July 1, 2013;  see also paragraph V-a set out below.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. Any town may vote to require that all votes by an advisory budget committee, a town budget committee, and the governing body or, in towns without a budget committee, all votes of the governing body relative to budget items or any warrant articles shall be recorded votes and the numerical tally of any such vote shall be printed in the town warrant next to the affected warrant article.  If a town has not voted to require such tallies to be printed in the town warrant next to the affected warrant article, the governing body may do so on its own initiative.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph V-a effective July 1, 2013;  see also paragraph V-a set out above.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. The legislative body of any town, school district, or village district may vote to require that all votes by an advisory budget committee, a town, school district, or village district budget committee, and the governing body or, in towns, school districts, or village districts without a budget committee, all votes of the governing body relative to budget items or any warrant articles shall be recorded votes and the numerical tally of any such vote shall be printed in the town, school district, or village district warrant next to the affected warrant article.  Unless the legislative body has voted otherwise, if a town or school district has not voted to require such tallies to be printed in the town or school district warrant next to the affected warrant article, the governing body may do so on its own initiative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-b. Any town may vote to require that the annual budget and all special warrant articles having a tax impact, as determined by the governing body, shall contain a notation stating the estimated tax impact of the article.  The determination of the estimated tax impact shall be subject to approval by the governing body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon completion of the budgets, an original of each budget and of each recommendation upon special warrant articles, signed by a quorum of the governing body, or of the budget committee, if any, shall be placed on file with the town or district clerk.  A certified copy shall be forwarded by the chair of the budget committee, if any, or otherwise by the chair of the governing body, to the commissioner of revenue administration pursuant to RSA 21-J:34.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) The governing body shall post certified copies of the budget with the warrant for the meeting.  The operating budget warrant article shall contain the amount as recommended by the budget committee if there is one.  In the case of towns, the budget shall also be printed in the town report made available to the legislative body at least one week before the date of the annual meeting.  A school district or village district may vote, under an article inserted in the warrant, to require the district to print its budget in an annual report made available to the district's voters at least one week before the date of the annual meeting.  Such district report may be separate or may be combined with the annual report of the town or towns within which the district is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The governing body in official ballot referenda jurisdictions operating under RSA 40:13 shall post certified copies of the default budget form or any amended default budget form with the proposed operating budget and the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The procedural requirements of this section shall apply to any special meeting called to raise or appropriate funds, or to reduce or rescind any appropriation previously made, provided, however, that any budget form used may be prepared locally.  Such a form or the applicable warrant article shall, at a minimum, show the request by the governing body or petitioners, the recommendation of the budget committee, if any, and the sources of anticipated offsetting revenue, other than taxes, if any.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the budget committee fails to deliver a budget prepared in accordance with this section, the governing body shall post its proposed budget with a notarized statement indicating that the budget is being posted pursuant to this paragraph in lieu of the budget committee's proposed budget.  This alternative budget shall then be the basis for the application of the provisions of this chapter.

<codesect>
Upon adoption under RSA 32:5-c, the following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In a town or district that has adopted this section, the estimated amount of local taxes to be raised for the fiscal year, as shown on the budget certified by the governing body or the budget committee and posted with the warrant for the annual meeting pursuant to RSA 32:5, shall not exceed the local taxes raised for the prior year, as shown on the same budget, by more than the tax cap authorized when this section was adopted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The tax cap shall be either a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage applied to the amount of local taxes raised by the town or district for the prior fiscal year as reported to the department of revenue administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The legislative body may override the cap by the usual procedures applicable to annual meetings and deliberative sessions of the legislative body.  The provisions of this section shall not limit the legislative body's authority to increase or decrease the amount of any appropriation or the total amount of all appropriations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 32:5-c Adoption of Local Tax Cap. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The provisions of RSA 32:5-b may be adopted by any local political subdivision of the state whose legislative body raises and appropriates funds through an annual meeting.  A  3/5 majority of those voting on the question shall be required to adopt the provisions of RSA 32:5-b.  Only votes in the affirmative or negative shall be included in the calculation of the  3/5 majority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The question shall be placed on the warrant of the annual meeting by the governing body or by petition under the procedures set out in RSA 39:3 or RSA 197:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A public hearing shall be held by the local governing body on the question at least 15 days, but not more than 30 days, before the question is to be voted on.  In multi-town districts, a public hearing shall be held in each town embraced by the district, none of which shall be held on the same day.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the town and at least 2 public places in each town of multi-town districts, and published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 7 days prior to the date of the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall we adopt the provisions of RSA 32:5-b, and implement a tax cap whereby the governing body (or budget committee) shall not submit a recommended budget that increases the amount to be raised by local taxes, based on the prior fiscal year's actual amount of local taxes raised, by more than _______ (insert either a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage)?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Voting on the question shall be by ballot, but the question shall not be placed on the official ballot used to elect officers, except in the case of a legislative body that uses an official ballot form of meeting under RSA 40:13 or under a charter adopted pursuant to RSA 49-D.  Polls shall remain open and ballots shall be accepted by the moderator for a period of not less than one hour following the completion of discussion on the question.  If a  3/5 majority of those voting on the question vote "yes,'' RSA 32:5-b shall apply within the local political subdivision beginning with the following fiscal year and for all subsequent years until it is rescinded as provided in paragraph VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any local political subdivision which has adopted RSA 32:5-b may consider rescinding its action in the manner described in paragraphs I through V. The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall we rescind the provisions of RSA 32:5-b, known as the tax cap, as adopted by the (local subdivision) on (date of adoption), so that there will no longer be a limit on increases to the recommended budget in the amount to be raised by local taxes?'' A  3/5 majority of those voting on the question shall be required to rescind the provisions of this section, except in the case of repeal by charter enactment under RSA 49-D.  Only votes in the affirmative or negative shall be included in the calculation of the  3/5 majority.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The amount has, prior to the end of that fiscal year, become encumbered by a legally-enforceable obligation, created by contract or otherwise, to any person for the expenditure of that amount;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amount is legally placed in any nonlapsing fund properly created pursuant to statute, including but not limited to a capital reserve fund under RSA 35, or a town-created trust fund under RSA 31:19-a;  or

V. The amount is appropriated under a special warrant article, in which case the local governing body may, at any properly noticed meeting held prior to the end of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made, vote to treat that appropriation as encumbered for a maximum of one additional fiscal year;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The amount is appropriated under a special warrant article and is explicitly designated in the article and by vote of the meeting as nonlapsing, in which case the meeting shall designate the time at which the appropriation shall lapse, which in no case shall be later than 5 years after the end of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If changes arise during the year following the annual meeting that make it necessary to expend more than the amount appropriated for a specific purpose, the governing body may transfer to that appropriation an unexpended balance remaining in some other appropriation, provided, however, that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The total amount spent shall not exceed the total amount appropriated at the town or district meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Records shall be kept by the governing body, such that the budget committee, if any, or any citizen requesting such records pursuant to RSA 91-A:4, may ascertain the purposes of appropriations to which, and from which, amounts have been transferred;  provided, however, that neither the budget committee nor other citizens shall have any authority to dispute or challenge the discretion of the governing body in making such transfers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement comparing all legislative body appropriations against all expenditures shall be deemed adequate for purposes of the records required by subparagraph (b), so long as every expenditure has been properly authorized and properly classified and entered and any expenditures exceeding the original legislative appropriations are offset by unexpended balances remaining in other appropriations, in which case the governing body shall not be required to designate the specific source of each transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any amount appropriated at the meeting under a special warrant article may be used only for the purpose specified in that article and shall not be transferred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The town or district meeting may vote separately on individual purposes of appropriation contained within any warrant article or budget, but such a separate vote shall not affect the governing body's legal authority to transfer appropriations, provided, however, that if the meeting deletes a purpose, or reduces the amount appropriated for that purpose to zero or does not approve an appropriation contained in a separate article, that purpose or article shall be deemed one for which no appropriation is made, and no amount shall be transferred to or expended for such purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. As used in RSA 32:10, I(a)-(d), concerning transfers of appropriations and records thereof, "purpose'' refers, in addition to its meaning in RSA 32:3, V, to individual line items in whatever detailed budget or chart of accounts is regularly used by the municipality.  The general wording of a vote adopting a budget or portion of a budget shall not be considered a "purpose'' to which an amount may be transferred.  The definition of "purpose'' as used in RSA 32:10, I(e) shall be the definition of "purpose'' under RSA 32:3, V.

<codesect>
When an unusual circumstance arises during the year which makes it necessary to expend money in excess of an appropriation which may result in an overexpenditure of the total amount appropriated for all purposes at the meeting or when no appropriation has been made, the selectmen or village district commissioners, upon application to the commissioner of revenue administration or the school board upon application to the commissioner of education, may be given authority to make such expenditure, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Such application shall be made prior to the making of such expenditure.  No such authority shall be granted until a majority of the budget committee, if any, has approved the application in writing.  If there is no budget committee, the governing body shall hold a public hearing on the request, with notice as provided in RSA 91-A:2.
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The budget committee shall consist of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Three to 12 members-at-large, who may be either elected or appointed by the moderator, as the town or district adopting the provisions of this subdivision shall by vote determine, who shall serve staggered terms of 3 years;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) One member of the governing body of the municipality and, if the municipality is a town, one member of the school board of each school district wholly within the town and one member of each village district wholly within the town, all of whom shall be appointed by their respective boards to serve for a term of one year and until their successors are qualified.  Each such member may be represented by an alternate member designated by the respective board, who shall, when sitting, have the same authority as the regular member.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the meeting decides that members-at-large are to be appointed, the staggering of terms shall begin that same year, with  1/3 of such members chosen to hold office for one year,  1/3 for 2 years, and  1/3 for 3 years, and each year thereafter  1/3 shall be chosen for terms of 3 years and until their successors are appointed and qualified.  If the number of members-at-large is not divisible by 3, the division shall be as even as possible over the 3 years.  All such appointments shall be made within 30 days after the annual meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the meeting decides members-at-large are to be elected, the meeting shall either elect the initial members for one-year terms by means other than by official ballot, or shall authorize the moderator to appoint members to serve until the next annual meeting, as provided in RSA 669:17.  Elections for staggered terms, as described in paragraph II, shall not begin until that next annual meeting, and shall be by official ballot if the municipality has adopted the official ballot system, as set forth in RSA 669.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A town or district which has adopted this subdivision may vote at any subsequent annual meeting to change the number or manner of selection of its members-at-large.  No such change shall take effect until the annual meeting following the meeting at which the change was adopted.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No selectman, town manager, member of the school board, village district commissioner, full-time employee, or part-time department head of the town, school district or village district or other associated agency shall serve as a member-at-large.  Every member-at-large shall be domiciled in the town or district adopting this subdivision and shall cease to hold office immediately upon ceasing to be so domiciled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. One of the members-at-large shall be elected by the budget committee as chair.  The committee may elect other officers as it sees fit.  A member-at-large shall cease to hold office immediately upon missing 4 consecutive scheduled or announced meetings of which that member received reasonable notice, without being excused by the chair.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In municipalities where members-at-large are appointed, the chair shall notify the moderator immediately upon the occurrence of any vacancy in the membership-at-large, and the vacancy shall be filled by appointment by the moderator within 5 days of such notification, otherwise by the budget committee.  In municipalities where members-at-large are elected, vacancies shall be filled by appointment by the budget committee.  Persons appointed to fill vacancies shall serve until the next annual meeting at which time a successor shall be elected or appointed to either fill the unexpired term or start a new term, as the case may be.

<codesect>
In any municipality electing this subdivision, or any district wholly within a town electing this subdivision, the total amount appropriated at any annual meeting shall not exceed by more than 10 percent the total amount recommended by the budget committee for such meeting.  In official ballot referendum municipalities, the recommendation of the budget committee made for the first session of the meeting shall be used for determining the 10 percent limitation.  These totals shall include appropriations contained in special warrant articles.  Money may be raised and appropriated for purposes included in the budget or in the warrant and not recommended by the budget committee, but not to an amount which would increase the total appropriations by more than the 10 percent allowed under this paragraph.  The 10 percent increase allowable under this paragraph shall be computed on the total amount recommended by the budget committee less that part of any appropriation item which constitutes fixed charges.  Fixed charges shall include appropriations for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Bonds, and all interest and principal payments thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notes, except tax anticipation notes, and all interest and principal payments thereon.

I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any municipality electing this subdivision, or any district wholly within a town electing this subdivision, if a bond request is not recommended in its entirety by the budget committee, the governing body of such municipality, after a majority vote by the governing body of the municipality in favor of the bond request at a duly posted meeting, shall place the bond request on the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislative body of any municipality described in RSA 32:18-a, I, may approve a bond request despite the 10 percent limitation provided in RSA 32:18 in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The governing body shall place the following statement at the beginning of the warrant article for such bond request:  "Passage of this article shall override the 10 percent limitation imposed on this appropriation due to the non-recommendation of the budget committee.''  Immediately below the bond request on the warrant shall be displayed (1) the recommendation of the governing body and (2) the recommendation of the budget committee, as included in the budget forms for the annual meeting pursuant to RSA 32:5, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If those voting "Yes'' on the bond request satisfy the requirements of RSA 33:8, the bond request is thereby approved.
