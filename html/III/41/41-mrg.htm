&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any annual town meeting under an article in the warrant, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of having a 3-year term for a tax collector.  The governing body shall determine whether the vote will be by official ballot or by special ballot.  If the town has adopted an official ballot and the governing body decides such vote will be by official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of changing the term of the tax collector from one year to 3 years, beginning with the term of the tax collector to be elected at next year's regular town meeting?''  Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot or the governing body decides such vote will be by special ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of a 3-year term, at the next annual meeting after the vote of approval, the town shall elect a tax collector for the 3-year term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After a 3-year term for tax collector has been established, at any subsequent annual town meeting, under an article in the warrant, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of continuing to have a 3-year term for the tax collector.  The governing body shall determine whether the vote shall be by official ballot or by special ballot.  If the town has adopted an official ballot and the governing body decides such vote will be by official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of changing the term of the tax collector from 3 years to one year, beginning at the end of the 3-year term of the tax collector elected this year (last year or 2 years ago)?''  Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot or the governing body decides such vote will be by special ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used during the open, business session of the town meeting to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question do not vote in favor of continuing the 3-year term, then at the subsequent annual town meeting occurring at the completion of the most recently elected tax collector's 3-year term, the voters shall elect a tax collector for a one-year term as provided by RSA 41:2.

I. The governing body of a town, or a town manager in a town which has adopted the provisions of RSA 37, may require a background investigation and a criminal history records check on any candidate for employment in a position in the town that requires the employee to work with or around children or elderly persons, enter the homes of citizens, or collect or manage money, prior to a final offer of employment.  A town may request only a state records check or both a federal and state records check, to be conducted through the division of state police.  The town may extend a conditional offer of employment to a candidate, with a final offer of employment subject to a successfully completed criminal history records check.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A candidate for employment in a position which the governing body or town manager determines requires a background investigation and a criminal history records check shall submit to the town a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The candidate shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a law enforcement agency as directed by the governing body or town manager.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern and a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check, the conditional offer of employment shall remain in effect.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the town may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where a candidate has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To obtain a state records check only, the town shall submit a state criminal history records release form to the division of state police.  To obtain both the federal and the state records check, the town shall submit the criminal history records release form and applicant finger print card to the division of state police, which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall report any criminal conviction information to the town governing body or town manager.  The town may submit fingerprint information electronically, in accordance with procedures established by the division of state police.  The town shall maintain the confidentiality and security of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any annual town meeting under an article in the warrant, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of having a 3-year term for town clerk.  The governing body will determine whether the vote will be by official ballot or by special ballot.  If the town has adopted an official ballot and the governing body decides such vote will be by official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of changing the term of the town clerk from one year to 3 years, beginning with the term of the town clerk to be elected at next year's regular town meeting?''  Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot or the governing body decides the vote will be by special ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of a 3-year term, at the next annual meeting after the vote of approval, the town shall elect a town clerk, for the 3-year term.  The duties and bond of the town clerk for a 3-year term are the same as for a one-year term under RSA 41:16.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After a 3-year term for town clerk has been established, at any subsequent annual town meeting, under an article in the warrant, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of continuing to have a 3-year term for the town clerk.  The governing body shall determine whether the vote will be by official ballot or by special ballot.  If the town has adopted an official ballot and the governing body decides such vote will be by official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  "Are you in favor of changing the term of the town clerk from 3 years to one year, beginning at the end of the 3-year term of the town clerk elected this year (last year or 2 years ago)?''  Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot or the governing body decides the vote will be by special ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used during the open, business session of the town meeting to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question do not vote in favor of continuing the 3-year term, then at the subsequent annual town meeting occurring at the completion of the most recently elected town clerk's 3-year term, the voters shall elect a clerk for a one-year term.

For the purposes of this section, "irregularity'' means an intentional misstatement of the financial statements or a theft of assets, and "material error'' means a mistake or omission resulting from gross negligence which results in a material misstatement of the financial statements.  The governing body may institute proceedings to remove the town clerk as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I.

II. (a) Within 20 days of receiving the notification provided in paragraph I, the town clerk shall respond to the alleged irregularities, material error, or failure to timely deposit funds.  The response shall be submitted to the governing body and the commissioner of the department of revenue administration and shall include written comment on each audit finding.
<br>

(b) If the town clerk fails to respond at any step in the process under this section within the prescribed period of time, then the governing body shall be permitted to remove the town clerk from office as provided in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 20 days of receiving the town clerk's written response, the governing body shall provide written notification to the town clerk and commissioner of the department of revenue administration of its decision to proceed or not to proceed to remove the town clerk from office.

V. After the town clerk's response and hearing, if any, and if the governing body determines that removal of the town clerk is justified, the governing body may remove the town clerk by written notice to the town clerk and the commissioner of revenue administration.  Any vacancy created by such a removal shall be filled by appointment by the governing body as provided in RSA 669:65.

<codesect>
The governing body may institute proceedings to remove the elected treasurer from office whenever, upon examination by the department of revenue administration, a certified public accountant, or a public accountant licensed by the state under RSA 309-B, the accounts are found to contain an irregularity or material error, or show evidence that the timely deposit of funds has not been made.  For the purposes of this section, "irregularity'' means an intentional misstatement of the financial statements or a theft of assets, and "material error'' means a mistake or omission resulting from gross negligence which results in a material misstatement of the financial statements.  The governing body may institute proceedings to remove the treasurer as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governing body shall notify the elected treasurer by certified mail with return receipt and the commissioner of the department of revenue administration of its intention to proceed under this section by providing a written explanation and justification for the removal, along with a copy of the audit findings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Within 20 days of receiving the notification provided in paragraph I, the elected treasurer shall respond to the alleged irregularities, material error, or failure to timely deposit funds.  The response shall be submitted to the governing body and the commissioner of the department of revenue administration and shall include written comment on each audit finding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the elected treasurer fails to respond at any step in the process under this section within the prescribed period of time, then the governing body shall be permitted to remove the elected treasurer from office as provided in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 20 days of receiving the elected treasurer's written response, the governing body shall provide written notification to the elected treasurer and commissioner of the department of revenue administration of its decision to proceed or not to proceed to remove the treasurer from office.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 10 days of receiving the written notification in paragraph III, the elected treasurer may request a hearing before the governing body.  If a hearing before the governing body is requested, it shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Conducted in accordance with RSA 91-A and RSA 43;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Held within 20 days of the date of the request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. After the elected treasurer's response and hearing, if any, and if the governing body determines that removal of the elected treasurer is justified, the governing body may remove the treasurer by written notice to the elected treasurer and the commissioner of revenue administration.  Any vacancy created by such a removal shall be filled by appointment by the governing body as provided in RSA 669:69.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Only securities defined by the bank commissioner as provided by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 383-B:3-301(e) shall be eligible to be pledged as collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) As an alternative to the option of collateralization for excess funds provided in subparagraph (a), the town treasurer may also invest public funds in interest-bearing deposits which meet all of the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The funds are initially invested through a federally insured bank chartered under the laws of New Hampshire or the federal government with a branch within the state, selected by the treasurer.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) On the same date that the funds are redeposited by the selected bank, the selected bank receives an amount of deposits from customers of other federally insured financial institutions equal to or greater than the amount of the funds initially invested through the selected bank by the treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The treasurer may delegate deposit, investment, recordkeeping, or reconciliation functions to other town officials or employees provided such delegation is in writing and includes written procedures acceptable to the selectmen, or in the case of a town operating under RSA 37, to the town manager, and is agreeable to all parties involved.  However any such delegation shall only be made to a town official or employee bonded in accordance with RSA 41:6 and rules adopted by the commissioner of revenue administration under RSA 541-A.  Such delegation shall not eliminate the responsibility of the treasurer to comply with all statutory duties required by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every collector of taxes shall keep in suitable books a fair and correct account in detail of the taxes due, collected, and abated, and of all property sold for nonpayment of taxes, which books shall be public records.  A tax collector shall remit all money collected to the town treasurer, or to the town treasurer's designee as provided by RSA 41:29, VI, at least on a weekly basis, or daily whenever tax receipts total $1,500 or more.  The collector shall make final payment to the town treasurer of all moneys collected within 10 days after the close of the town's fiscal year.  Failure to remit collections on a timely basis as required by this paragraph shall be cause for immediate removal from office under RSA 41:40.  He or she shall submit the tax books and lists to the treasurer and selectmen for inspection and computation when requested so to do and if they discover any errors therein they shall immediately notify the town auditors thereof;  and the auditors shall promptly examine the collector's records and make a written report to the selectmen and the department of revenue administration of their findings, conclusions, and recommendations.  The collector shall be at a usual place of business, or any other place, at least one day each month for at least 2 hours continuously for the transaction of tax business, which time and place shall be printed upon the tax bills sent out by the collector.  The collector shall make a written report to the town at the end of each fiscal year which shall contain the amount of the taxes committed to him or her to collect;  the amount of taxes collected, together with interest thereon;  the amount of discounts allowed;  the amount of taxes abated;  the total amount of uncollected taxes;  and an account of all sales of real estate to collect taxes.  Upon written request therefor the collector shall provide the selectmen with an itemized list of the uncollected taxes at the end of the fiscal year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 41:40 Removal of Tax Collector. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governing body may institute proceedings to remove the tax collector from office whenever, upon examination by the department of revenue administration, a certified public accountant, or a public accountant licensed by the state under RSA 309-B, the accounts are found to contain an irregularity or material error, or show evidence that the timely deposit of funds has not been made in accordance with RSA 41:35.  For the purposes of this section, "irregularity'' means an intentional misstatement of the financial statements or a theft of assets, and "material error'' means a mistake or omission resulting from gross negligence which results in a material misstatement of the financial statements.  The governing body may institute proceedings to remove the tax collector as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governing body shall notify the tax collector by certified mail with return receipt and the commissioner of the department of revenue administration of its intention to proceed under this section by providing a written explanation and justification for the removal, along with a copy of the audit findings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Within 20 days of receiving the notification provided in paragraph I, the tax collector shall respond to the alleged irregularities, material error, or failure to timely deposit funds.  The response shall be submitted to the governing body and the commissioner of the department of revenue administration and shall include written comment on each audit finding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the tax collector fails to respond at any step in the process under this section within the prescribed period of time, then the governing body shall be permitted to remove the tax collector from office as provided in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 20 days of receiving the tax collector's written response, the governing body shall provide written notification to the tax collector and commissioner of the department of revenue administration of its decision to proceed or not to proceed to remove the tax collector from office.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 10 days of receiving the written notification in paragraph III, the tax collector may request a hearing before the governing body.  If a hearing before the governing body is requested, it shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Conducted in accordance with RSA 91-A and RSA 43;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Held within 20 days of the date of the request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. After the tax collector's response and hearing, if any, and if the governing body determines that removal of the tax collector is justified, the governing body may remove the tax collector by written notice to the tax collector and the commissioner of revenue administration.  Any vacancy created by such a removal shall be filled by appointment by the governing body as provided in RSA 669:67.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The governing body's determination under paragraph V may be appealed de novo to the superior court in the county in which the municipality is located.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any annual town meeting under an article in the warrant placed there by petition, the voters may, whether or not the terms of office for town clerk and tax collector for said town are coterminous, vote, by ballot, to determine if they are in favor of having the office of town clerk combined with the office of tax collector, thereby creating a new office of town clerk-tax collector to be held by one individual.  If the town has adopted an official ballot for election of its officers the town clerk shall insert the question relative to this matter on said official ballot, or if the town does not have an official ballot the town clerk shall prepare a special ballot for the same purpose.  If a majority of those persons voting on the question vote in favor of creating the combined office of town clerk-tax collector, at the next annual meeting, occurring after the vote of approval, the town shall choose by ballot one individual as town clerk-tax collector, and such individual shall serve for a term of one year, or a term of 3 years as the petition may set forth.  The term of any individual then in office as town clerk or tax collector shall cease and the newly elected town clerk-tax collector shall take office.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At any annual town meeting held at least 2 years after the office of town clerk-tax collector has been created, under an article in the warrant, the voters may vote, by ballot, to determine if they are in favor of continuing the combined office.  If a majority of those voting on the question do not vote in favor of continuing such combined office, at the next annual meeting, in which an election for town clerk-tax collector is to be held the voters shall choose one individual as town clerk and another individual as town tax collector.
