<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All municipalities shall annually, or more often as necessary, conduct an audit of the accounts of any officer or agent handling funds of the municipality.  Elected auditors conducting such audits shall follow audit procedures in rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any municipality, or any political subdivision exclusively within a municipality, with a population of fewer than 750 as of the most recent federal census, provided a financial statement audit is not required by another law, regulation, or contract, may, not less than 45 days before the end of the fiscal year, petition the commissioner to waive the annual audit requirement for that fiscal year and provide an alternative plan for reviewing the municipality's financial accounts.  If the commissioner approves the scope of services as proposed by the municipality, such services shall be completed by either the locally elected auditor or a CPA.  If the commissioner does not approve or no alternative procedures or scope of services is provided by the municipality, then the commissioner shall determine the appropriate scope of services.
