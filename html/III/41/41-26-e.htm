&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 41:26-e Appointed Town Treasurer. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any town may, under an article in the warrant for the annual town meeting, vote to authorize the appointment rather than the election of a town treasurer.  Such appointment shall be made in accordance with RSA 669:17-d by either the board of selectmen, or in the case of a town operating under RSA 37 upon recommendation of the town manager with approval of the board of selectmen.  Whenever the selectmen or manager appoint the treasurer, such appointment shall be made in writing and shall include the compensation to be paid.  Any town may rescind the vote to appoint a town treasurer under an article in the warrant for the annual town meeting.  If such article to rescind the appointment of a treasurer is approved, then the town shall reinstate the office of elected treasurer and shall fill the vacancy in accordance with RSA 669:69.
