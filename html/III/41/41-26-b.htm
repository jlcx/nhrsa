At any annual town meeting under an article in the warrant, the voters may vote to determine if they are in favor of having a 3-year term for the elected town treasurer.

If the town has adopted an official ballot and the governing body decides such vote will be by official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  Are you in favor of changing the term of the elected town treasurer from one year to 3 years, beginning with the term of the town treasurer to be elected at next year's regular town meeting?'' Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot or the governing body decides such vote will be by special ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of a 3-year term at the next annual meeting after the vote of approval, the town shall elect a town treasurer for the 3-year term.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII.

If the town has adopted an official ballot and the governing body decides such vote will be by official ballot, the clerk shall cause the following question to be printed on said ballot:  Are you in favor of changing the term of the elected town treasurer from 3 years to one year, beginning at the end of the 3-year term of the elected town treasurer elected this year (last year or 2 years ago)?'' Said question shall be printed in the form prescribed by RSA 656:13.  If the town has not adopted an official ballot or the governing body decides such vote will be by special ballot, the clerk shall cause the same question to be printed upon special ballots which shall be used during the open, business session of the town meeting to determine the vote of the town.  If a majority of those voting on the question do not vote in favor of continuing the 3-year term, then at the subsequent annual town meeting occurring at the completion of the most recently elected town treasurer's 3-year term, the voters shall elect a treasurer for a one-year term.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII.
