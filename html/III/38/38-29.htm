&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 38:29 Water Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The funds received from the collection of water rates shall be kept as a separate and distinct fund to be known as the water fund.  Such fund shall be allowed to accumulate from year to year, shall not be commingled with town or city tax revenues, and shall not be deemed part of the municipality's general fund accumulated surplus.  Such fund may be expended only for the purposes specified in RSA 38:28, or for the previous expansion or replacement of water lines or water systems.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except when a capital reserve fund is established pursuant to paragraph III, all water funds shall be held in the custody of the municipal treasurer.  Estimates of anticipated water rate revenues and anticipated expenditures from the water fund shall be prepared and submitted to the governing body as set forth in RSA 32:3, if applicable, and shall be included as part of the municipal budget submitted to the local legislative body for approval.  If the municipality has a properly established board of water commissioners, then notwithstanding RSA 41:29 or RSA 48:16, the treasurer shall pay out amounts from the water fund only upon order of the board of water commissioners.  Expenditures shall be within amounts appropriated by the local legislative body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At the option of the local governing body, or of the board of water commissioners, if any, all or part of any surplus in the water fund may be placed in one or more capital reserve funds held in the custody of the trustees of trust funds pursuant to RSA 35:7.  If such a reserve fund is created, then the governing body, or board of water commissioners, if any, may expend such funds pursuant to RSA 35:15 without prior approval or appropriation by the local legislative body, but all such expenditures shall be reported to the municipality pursuant to RSA 38:21.  This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the establishment of other capital reserve funds for any lawful purpose relating to municipal water systems.
