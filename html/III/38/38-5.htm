<codesect>
Any unincorporated town or unorganized place may initially establish such a plant after  2/3 of the members of the county convention shall have voted that it is expedient to do so, and, if there are any registered voters in that unincorporated town or unorganized place, after such action by the county convention shall have been confirmed by a majority of the qualified votes in that unincorporated town or unorganized place at a regular election or at a special meeting duly warned in either case.  Such confirming vote shall be had within one year from the date of the vote to establish such a plant, and if favorable, shall create a rebuttable presumption that such action is in the public interest.  If the vote is unfavorable, the question shall not be again submitted to the voters within 2 years thereafter.
