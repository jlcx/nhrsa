Within 90 days of the final determination of the price to be paid for the plant and property to be acquired under the provisions of RSA 38:8, 38:9 or 38:10 and any consequential damages under RSA 38:33, the municipality shall decide whether or not to acquire the plant and property at such price by a vote to issue bonds and notes pursuant to RSA 33-B as may be necessary and expedient for the purpose of defraying the cost of purchasing or taking the plant, property, or facilities of the utility which the municipality may thus acquire.  The municipality is authorized to hold a special meeting, if necessary, to take such vote without having to petition the superior court for permission to do so.  An affirmative vote under RSA 33-B shall constitute ratification on the part of the municipality of the final determination of the price to be paid for the plant and property under the provisions of RSA 38:8, 38:9, or 38:10 and any consequential damages under RSA 38:33.  If the money is so raised it shall immediately be paid to the utility, which shall thereupon execute a proper conveyance and surrender the plant and property to the municipality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 38:22 Liens and Collection of Charges. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph III, all charges for services furnished to patrons by a municipally owned electric, gas, water, or wastewater utility shall create a lien upon the real estate where such services are furnished.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in paragraph III, a municipality may use any of the following collection procedures for charges and the use of one collection procedure for one service shall not preclude the use of a different collection procedure for another service:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A municipality may commit bills for charges to the tax collector with a warrant signed by the appropriate municipal officials requiring the tax collector to collect them.  The tax collector shall have the same rights and remedies, including a lien on the real estate, and be subject to the same liabilities in relation thereto as in the collection of taxes as provided in RSA 80;  provided, however, that the real estate lien shall continue for 18 months from the date of the last unpaid bill.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The official or board responsible for administering the municipal utility may collect charges for services by direct billing on any periodic basis it may choose.  All charges which are delinquent may be committed to the tax collector with a warrant signed by the appropriate municipal officials requiring the tax collector to collect them.  The tax collector shall have the same rights and remedies, including a lien on the real estate, and be subject to the same liabilities in relation thereto as in the collection of taxes as provided in RSA 80;  provided, however, that the real estate lien shall continue for 18 months from the date of the last unpaid bill.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the official or board responsible for administering the municipal utility has not committed the charges to the collector of taxes, the municipality shall have a lien upon the real estate where the services were furnished and the lien shall continue for 18 months from the date of the last unpaid bill, unless the municipality records in the registry of deeds for the county in which the land is situated a notice of lien, in which case the lien shall continue for 6 years from the date of the last unpaid bill.  The lien may be enforced in a suit by the municipality against the owner of the real estate.  In such a suit, the municipality shall have the right to a judgment for per year charges, interest at the rate of 12 percent from the date of the last unpaid bill to the date of judgment, and costs.  The records in the municipal department which furnished the services shall be sufficient notice to maintain suit upon the lien against subsequent purchasers or attaching creditors of the real estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When the services were furnished to some person or legal entity other than the owner of the real estate, the liens provided for in this paragraph shall be effective against the owner of the real estate only for charges of which the owner of the real estate was notified by the municipality within 120 days of the date the charges became delinquent;  provided, however, that a municipality may meet these notice requirements by mailing to the owner of the real estate copies of the bills for services at the same time bills are furnished to the person or legal entity which received the services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No municipally owned electric, gas, water, or wastewater utility shall perform non-emergency work with a total cost in excess of $250 per project on facilities on customer property beyond the utility's final shutoff point or the point at which the property owner is responsible for construction or maintenance, or both, unless a written contract has been executed and signed between the owner or an authorized representative of the property and an authorized representative of the utility.  The contract shall include the terms of the work to be performed, the name and address of the property owner, the location of the work to be performed, the estimated price of the work, the time of completion, and any other agreed upon stipulations relating to the project.  No lien shall be placed on the property for such work in the absence of such a contract.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The funds received from the collection of water rates shall be kept as a separate and distinct fund to be known as the water fund.  Such fund shall be allowed to accumulate from year to year, shall not be commingled with town or city tax revenues, and shall not be deemed part of the municipality's general fund accumulated surplus.  Such fund may be expended only for the purposes specified in RSA 38:28, or for the previous expansion or replacement of water lines or water systems.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except when a capital reserve fund is established pursuant to paragraph III, all water funds shall be held in the custody of the municipal treasurer.  Estimates of anticipated water rate revenues and anticipated expenditures from the water fund shall be prepared and submitted to the governing body as set forth in RSA 32:3, if applicable, and shall be included as part of the municipal budget submitted to the local legislative body for approval.  If the municipality has a properly established board of water commissioners, then notwithstanding RSA 41:29 or RSA 48:16, the treasurer shall pay out amounts from the water fund only upon order of the board of water commissioners.  Expenditures shall be within amounts appropriated by the local legislative body.

At the option of the local governing body, or of the board of water commissioners, if any, all or part of any surplus in the water fund may be placed in one or more capital reserve funds held in the custody of the trustees of trust funds pursuant to RSA 35:7.  If such a reserve fund is created, then the governing body, or board of water commissioners, if any, may expend such funds pursuant to RSA 35:15 without prior approval or appropriation by the local legislative body, but all such expenditures shall be reported to the municipality pursuant to RSA 38:21.  This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the establishment of other capital reserve funds for any lawful purpose relating to municipal water systems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 38:31 Discontinuance of Service. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, except as provided in paragraph V of this section, no municipal water company shall disconnect service to a customer if any part of the service provided accrues to the benefit of one or more parties known by company to be residential tenants, unless the company gives written notice to the tenants.  Such notice shall set forth:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The date on or after which the company proposes to disconnect service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement that the reason for disconnection is a dispute between the company and the landlord.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement that the tenant should contact the landlord for more information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An address and telephone at which the tenant may contact the utility in order to make arrangements to maintain service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A municipal water company shall refrain from terminating service to the affected premises if so requested by the tenant, provided that the tenant agrees to be responsible for service provided as of the date of the tenant's request.  However, the water company may continue to list the landlord's past due balance on the tenant's bill, and the lien created pursuant to RSA 38:22 shall include any past due charges which accrue after the company begins billing the tenant.  The utility shall provide direct service to the person requesting it on terms and conditions applicable to all residential customers.  Such service may include other charges, such as sewer and fire protection service, if customarily included with water service billing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Immediately upon learning that a tenant has been disconnected without the notice required in paragraph I, the water company shall reconnect service and may charge a reasonable reconnection fee which may be added to the existing arrearage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The notice required by paragraph I shall be provided to the tenant no less than 7 days in advance of the proposed disconnection, by posting a conspicuously lettered notice on the main entrance door to each building in which service is being terminated.  In addition, the company shall post the notice on a back door or side door to which the company has reasonable access, or in a common area of each building.  The company, at its option, may notify the tenants in the affected property by mail rather than by posting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The notice to tenants required by paragraph I of this section shall not be required when necessary to avoid danger to life or property, and upon the order of a duly constituted public authority such as police, firefighters, public health officer, and building inspectors.
