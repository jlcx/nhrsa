&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 38:28 Water Rates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For the defraying of the cost of acquisition, construction, payment of the interest on any debt incurred, management, maintenance, operation, and repair of water systems, or construction, enlargement, or improvement of such systems, the governing body, or the board of water commissioners, if any, may establish a scale of rates to be called water rates, may prescribe the manner in which and the time at which such rates are to be paid and may change such scale from time to time as may be deemed advisable.  The amount of such rates may be based upon the consumption of water on the premises connected to the water system, or the number of persons served on the premises, or upon some other equitable basis.
