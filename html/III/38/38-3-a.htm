<codesect>
Any regional water district may initially establish such a plant after  2/3 of the members of the governing body of the district shall have voted affirmatively, and a majority of the constituent municipalities of the district by a majority vote of their legislative bodies have confirmed that vote.  Such confirming vote shall create a rebuttable presumption that such action is in the public interest.  If the vote is unfavorable, the question shall not be again submitted to the constituent municipalities within 2 years thereafter.
