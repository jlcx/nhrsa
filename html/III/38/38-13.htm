&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 38:13 Ratification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Within 90 days of the final determination of the price to be paid for the plant and property to be acquired under the provisions of RSA 38:8, 38:9 or 38:10 and any consequential damages under RSA 38:33, the municipality shall decide whether or not to acquire the plant and property at such price by a vote to issue bonds and notes pursuant to RSA 33-B as may be necessary and expedient for the purpose of defraying the cost of purchasing or taking the plant, property, or facilities of the utility which the municipality may thus acquire.  The municipality is authorized to hold a special meeting, if necessary, to take such vote without having to petition the superior court for permission to do so.  An affirmative vote under RSA 33-B shall constitute ratification on the part of the municipality of the final determination of the price to be paid for the plant and property under the provisions of RSA 38:8, 38:9, or 38:10 and any consequential damages under RSA 38:33.  If the money is so raised it shall immediately be paid to the utility, which shall thereupon execute a proper conveyance and surrender the plant and property to the municipality.  If the ratifying vote provided for in this section shall be in the negative, no other action under this chapter shall be had during the ensuing period of 2 years.
