&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 38:14 Operation of Plant. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A municipality, which has so acquired the plant, property, or facilities of a public utility in any other municipality, may operate within such other municipality as a public utility with the same rights and franchises which the owners of such outlying plant, as purchased, would have had such purchase not been made.  The operation by a municipality outside its own limits shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission except as provided in RSA 362.  If the outlying municipality shall itself vote to establish a municipal plant all the provisions of this chapter shall be binding as to such determination.
