&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 48:1 Disqualification for Employment by City. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No publicly elected official of a city, except school district officers, who as such official is authorized to appropriate or expend public funds shall be employed during the term for which he is elected by any department, board or commission of the city in any other capacity or in any other position of employment by the city where compensation is allowed, except as justice or clerk of the municipal court, or call firemen, or special police officers;  provided that in case any city charter, at the time this section takes effect, provides specifically that certain elected officials may be employed in other specified employments, or positions, contrary to the provisions of this section, the provisions of said charter shall prevail.  Upon the acceptance of any such prohibited employment by a publicly elected official, as prohibited herein, the elective office shall forthwith become vacant and shall be filled as provided by law.  The provisions of this section shall not affect the rights of cities or towns to make such consolidation of official functions as may have been heretofore authorized by statute.
