In towns, village districts or precincts having an official ballot the clerk shall cause this question to be printed on the official ballot and the voting on this question shall be taken up at the opening of the polls and carried on simultaneously with the balloting for town officers.  In towns, village districts or precincts which do not have an official ballot the clerk shall cause to be prepared in advance of such meeting a printed ballot containing the above question and in either method the question shall be followed by the words "Yes'' and "No'' with boxes after each, in which the voter may mark his choice.
