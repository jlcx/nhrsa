&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 39:2-a Optional Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any town may at an annual meeting vote to conduct the choice of town officers elected by an official ballot and other action required to be inserted on said official ballot on the second Tuesday of March or on the second Tuesday of May if the town has adopted the provisions of RSA 31:94-a and authorize the selectmen to choose another day for the second session of the town meeting for the transaction of all other town business.  Upon written application of 25 or more voters, addressed to the selectmen, the following question shall be submitted to the voter at such annual meeting:  "Do you approve of having 2 sessions for the annual town meeting in this town, the first session for choice of town officers elected by an official ballot and other action required to be inserted on said official ballot and the second session, on a date set by the selectmen, for transaction of other business?''  This question shall appear upon the official ballot in towns having such a ballot, otherwise upon a special ballot prepared by the town clerk.  Proper provision shall be made on the ballot to permit the voter clearly to indicate his choice on the question.  If a majority of the legal voters present and voting on the question vote in the affirmative, the provisions of this section shall be declared adopted.  In any town adopting the provisions hereof the warrant for an annual meeting held hereunder shall prescribe the place, day and hours of each session of said meeting and said warrant shall be posted as required for any town meeting.  In a town which has adopted the provisions of this section no business other than the election of town officers elected by an official ballot and other action required to be inserted on said official ballot shall be taken up at the first session of said meetings.  A town which has adopted the provisions hereof may rescind such action in the same manner as provided for its adoption.  The question in this case shall be:  "Shall the provisions for having 2 sessions of the annual town meeting be declared no longer in effect in this town?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Alternatively, a town may conduct its meetings and the election of officers through use of the official ballot by adoption of the provisions of RSA 40:13.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No article included in a warrant for a town meeting may be considered by placing a question on the official ballot used for election of town officers unless use of the official ballot for that article or type of article is specifically authorized or required by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of this section and RSA 40:4-e:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any law which requires a ballot vote on an article, and which uses the term "official ballot'', shall be deemed to require the use of the official ballot for voting on that article, in towns which use the official ballot for the election of officers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any law which prescribes the wording of a question, but where the term "official ballot'' is not used, shall be deemed to authorize, but not require, the use of the official ballot for that question, unless a contrary intent is specified.  If the official ballot is not used for voting on such a question, the prescribed wording shall be placed in the warrant, and may also be placed upon a preprinted ballot to be acted upon in open meeting in the same manner as a secret "yes-no'' ballot under RSA 40:4-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This section shall not prohibit the use of secret written ballots at any town meeting pursuant to RSA 40:4-a or 4-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Articles concerning the issuance of bonds or notes shall not be placed on the official ballot, unless the municipality has adopted a charter provision authorizing that votes on the issuance of bonds or notes shall be placed on the official ballot or unless the municipality has adopted the provisions of RSA 40:12-14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding paragraph IV, in the town of Bedford, articles concerning the issuance of bonds or notes shall be in accordance with Bedford's Town Charter, Article 1-5 Finance, Paragraph 1-5-11 Borrowing Procedure.
