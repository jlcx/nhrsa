&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:39-c Administrative Enforcement of Ordinances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a town may use the following provisions in the enforcement of its ordinances and regulations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any town may establish, by ordinance adopted by the legislative body, a system for the administrative enforcement of violations of any municipal code, ordinance, bylaw, or regulation and for the collection of penalties, to be used prior to the service of a formal summons and complaint.  Such a system may be administered by a police department or other municipal agency.  The system may include opportunities for persons who do not wish to contest violations to pay such penalties by mail.  The system may also provide for a schedule of enhanced penalties the longer such penalties remain unpaid;  provided, however, that the penalty for any separate offense shall in no case exceed the maximum penalty for a violation as set forth in RSA 31:39, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A written notice of violation containing a description of the offense and any applicable schedule of penalties, delivered in person or by first-class mail to the last-known address of the offender, shall be deemed adequate service of process for purposes of any administrative enforcement system established under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the administrative enforcement system established under paragraph I is unsuccessful at resolving alleged violations, or in the case of a town that has not established such a system, a summons may be issued as otherwise provided by law, including use of the procedure for plea by mail set forth in RSA 31:39-d.
