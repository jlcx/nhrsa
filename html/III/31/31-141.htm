&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:141 Assessments and Fees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon adoption of the budgetary appropriation, the municipality may levy assessments or fees, or both, in an amount not greater than the net appropriation to a water and/or sewer utility district fund.  The assessments and fees shall be made against the owners or users, or both, of properties in the water and/or sewer utility district and shall be based upon a formula determined by the municipality to be in relative proportion to benefits received by each property owner or user, or both, in the water and/or sewer utility district.  Assessments and fees shall be billed and collected as specified by ordinance adopted by majority vote of the governing body of the municipality after a public hearing or in accordance with the terms of the intermunicipal agreement.  Government property and non-profit organizations within the district shall be subject to the assessment and fees.  Interest and other collection procedures shall be made by the tax collector or other official responsible for property tax collection.  Enforcement powers for nonpayment shall be the same as those provided under RSA 80 relative to property tax collection.
