&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:5-a Appropriations of Disaster Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding RSA 31:5, the selectmen may call a special town meeting to authorize the expenditure of federal funds allocated to the town as a result of a major disaster as declared by the governor and to appropriate the local matching share for such funds.  The authorization to expend federal funds and the appropriation of matching funds shall be the only action taken at such meeting.  Any special meeting called under this section shall have the same authority as that of an annual town meeting.
