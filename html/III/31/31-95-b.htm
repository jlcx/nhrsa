I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any town or village district at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing, indefinitely until specific rescission of such authority, the board of selectmen or board of commissioners to apply for, accept and expend, without further action by the town or village district meeting, unanticipated money from the state, federal or other governmental unit or a private source which becomes available during the fiscal year.  The following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such warrant article to be voted on shall read:  "Shall the town (or village district) accept the provisions of RSA 31:95-b providing that any town (or village district) at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing indefinitely, until specific rescission of such authority, the selectmen (or commissioners) to apply for, accept and expend, without further action by the town (or village district) meeting, unanticipated money from a state, federal, or other governmental unit or a private source which becomes available during the fiscal year?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a majority of voters voting on the question vote in the affirmative, the proposed warrant article shall be in effect in accordance with the terms of the article until such time as the town or village district meeting votes to rescind its vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such money shall be used only for legal purposes for which a town or village district may appropriate money.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) For unanticipated moneys in the amount of $5,000 or more, the selectmen or board of commissioners shall hold a prior public hearing on the action to be taken.  Notice of the time, place, and subject of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the relevant municipality at least 7 days before the hearing is held.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board of selectmen may establish the amount of unanticipated funds required for notice under this subparagraph, provided such amount is less than $5,000.  For unanticipated moneys in an amount less than $5,000, the board of selectmen shall post notice of the funds in the agenda and shall include notice in the minutes of the board of selectmen meeting in which such moneys are discussed.  The acceptance of unanticipated moneys under this subparagraph shall be made in public session of any regular board of selectmen meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Action to be taken under this section shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
