<codesect>
Any town may establish computer-based geographic information systems and control the distribution of that information, subject to RSA 91-A.  The town may finance the completion and perpetuation of the system through establishing a special revenue fund under RSA 31:95-c and 31:95-d or through nonprofit corporations.  The town may charge fees for the use of the system.
