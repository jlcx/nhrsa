&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:42 Regulation by Selectmen. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Prior to adoption of bylaws by a town under RSA 31:41, 41-a or 41-d, the selectmen may regulate the operation of open-air motion picture theatres, motor vehicle race tracks or coin operated amusement devices within the limits of the town and fix reasonable fees for such operation.  Such regulations made by the selectmen shall be effective only until the next annual town meeting.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit the town from adopting bylaws in accordance with RSA 31:41, 41-a, or 41-d, at any special town meeting, which shall supersede any regulations made by the selectmen.
