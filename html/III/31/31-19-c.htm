<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislative body of a municipality that created, on or before January 1, 2012, an actuarial liability to pay other post-employment benefits (OPEB) to employees or officers after their termination of service may establish an irrevocable trust to pay those benefits.  In this section, the term "other post-employment benefits'' means employee benefits other than pensions that are received after employment ends, and may include such medical, disability, or other health benefits, as are covered by Statement No. 45 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).  The term "trust'' means a trust qualified under GASB Statement No. 43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Deposits to any fund under such a trust and any earnings on those deposits shall be irrevocable and shall be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of retirees and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the plans or programs providing other post-employment benefits, except that funds governed by the trust may be withdrawn for other purposes only when an employer's liability owed to former officers or employees for other post-employment benefits has been satisfied or otherwise eliminated pursuant to subparagraph V(b).  The assets of any trust created pursuant to this section or in which a municipality participates pursuant to this section shall be exempt from taxation and execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other process.  No public officer, employee, or agency shall divert, use, or authorize the use of such funds for any purpose other than as provided in law for other post-employment benefits covered by the trust and administrative expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The trustees of any trust created pursuant to this section shall have the full power to invest, reinvest, and manage the assets of the trust.  The trustees shall invest the assets of the trust with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.  The trustees shall also diversify such investments so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.  The board of trustees may engage a trust administrator, investment consultants, or other qualified professionals to assist with management and investment of the funds of the trust and may pay for these services out of the funds of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Trusts created by a municipality pursuant to this section shall by administered by the board of trustees established by the municipality pursuant to RSA 31:22.  The accounts of the trustees shall be subject to the auditing and reporting requirements of RSA 31:33.  Other provisions of RSA 31:19 through 31:38-a governing trusts shall also apply unless they are contrary to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The municipality may withdraw money from the funds of a trust created pursuant to this section only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As needed to pay other post-employment benefits owed to former officers and employees;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When all other post-employment benefits liability owed to former officers or employees of the employing entity has been satisfied or otherwise defeased.
