<codesect>
If legal proceedings have been commenced by a town against the state over whether a state program or responsibility violates the provisions of Part I, Article 28-a of the New Hampshire constitution relative to mandated programs, all penalties or liens which the state may impose on the town for failure to comply with the state program or mandate shall be stayed until the court proceedings are completed.  For the purposes of this section, the term "town'' shall mean every political subdivision of the state, which shall include any village district, school district, city, county, unincorporated town, or unorganized place.
