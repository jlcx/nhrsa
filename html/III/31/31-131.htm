&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:131 Origin of Warrant Articles. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any question which an enabling statute authorizes to be placed in the warrant for a town meeting by petition may also be inserted by the selectmen, even in the absence of any petition.  So long as the subject matter of an action taken at a town meeting was distinctly stated in the warrant, no defect in the process by which such subject matter came to appear in the warrant shall affect the validity of such action.
