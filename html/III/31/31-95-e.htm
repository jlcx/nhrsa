<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any town or village district at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing the board of selectmen or board of commissioners to accept gifts of personal property, other than money, which may be offered to the town or village district for any public purpose, and such authorization shall remain in effect until rescinded by a vote of town or village district meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Prior to the acceptance of any such gift with a value of $5,000 or more, the selectmen or board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing on the proposed acceptance.  For gifts with a value of less than $5,000, a public hearing on the proposed acceptance shall be at the discretion of the selectmen or board of commissioners.  If no public hearing is held, the board of selectmen or board of commissioners shall post notice of the gift in the agenda and shall include notice in the minutes of the board of selectmen or board of commissioners meeting at which such gift is discussed.  The acceptance of gifts under this paragraph shall be made in public session of any regular board of selectmen or board of commissioners meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No acceptance of any personal property under the authority of this section shall be deemed to bind the town or village district to raise, appropriate or expend any public funds for the operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of such personal property.
