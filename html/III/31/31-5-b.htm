I. In the past, irregularities and procedural defects in actions of municipal legislative bodies have been cured by actions of the general court.  The procedure in this section is an alternative approach which enables municipalities to effect legalization by local action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the legislative body of a municipality has voted by the requisite majority, by written ballot or in any other manner legally authorized, to take any legal actions and the vote is subsequently discovered to be procedurally defective, such defects may be cured and legalized by a vote at a special meeting called for the purpose of ratifying the procedurally defective action.  Procedurally defective actions shall mean minor procedural irregularities such as failure to comply with statutory requirements regarding time or place of notice, vote, hearing, or wording, or with any procedural act not contrary to the spirit or intent of the law.  The ratification of the procedurally defective action shall be subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The municipality may, on the authority of the governing body, call a special town meeting for the exclusive purpose of curing such defect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The special town meeting called for that purpose may not take place less than 21 calendar days after the original vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Not less than 7 calendar days prior to the special town meeting, not counting the day of the special town meeting, the governing body shall conduct a public hearing at which the reasons for the special town meeting shall be explained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The municipality shall comply with all statutory notice and procedural requirements for holding special town meetings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The necessary majority required to cure the defects shall be the same as the majority as required for passage of the original article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When any procedural defect has been cured under this section, actions of the voters shall be valid as if all statutorily required proceedings had been complied with.
