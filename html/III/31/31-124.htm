&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:124 Assessments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon local adoption of the budget, the municipality may levy assessments in an amount not greater than the net appropriation to a central business service district account.  The assessments shall be made against the owners of commercial and industrial properties and such other types of property as may be determined by the municipality abutting any public right-of-way in the central business service district and shall be based upon the relative linear foot frontage of the owner's property as a percentage of the total linear foot frontage of the applicable property in the district or another formula determined by the municipality to be in relative proportion to benefits received by each property owner in the central business service district.  Assessments shall be billed and collected as specified by ordinance.  Interest and other collection procedures shall be made by the tax collector or other official responsible for property tax collection.  Enforcement powers for nonpayment shall be the same as those provided under RSA 80 relative to property tax collection.
