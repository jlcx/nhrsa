&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:5 At Special Meetings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) No money shall be raised or appropriated or shall any appropriation previously made be reduced or rescinded at any special town meeting except by vote by ballot, nor unless the ballots cast at such meeting shall be equal in number to at least  1/2 of the number of legal voters borne on the checklist of the town entitled to vote at the annual or biennial election next preceding such special meeting;  and such checklist, corrected according to law, shall be used at any meeting upon the request of 10 legal voters of the town.  This section shall not apply to money to be raised for the public defense or any military purpose in time of war.  In case an emergency arises requiring an immediate expenditure of money, the selectmen may petition the superior court for permission to hold a special town meeting which, if granted, shall give said meeting the same authority as an annual town meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Emergency'' for the purposes of this section shall mean a sudden or unexpected situation or occurrence, or combination of occurrences, of a serious and urgent nature, that demands prompt, or immediate action, including an immediate expenditure of money.  This definition, however, does not establish a requirement that an emergency involves a crisis in every set of circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To verify that an emergency exists, a petitioner shall present, and the court shall consider, a number of factors including:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The severity of the harm to be avoided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The urgency of the petitioner's need.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Whether the claimed emergency was foreseeable or avoidable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Whether the appropriation could have been made at the annual meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Whether there are alternative remedies not requiring an appropriation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. On or before the date of filing the petition with the superior court, the selectmen shall forward a copy of the petition and the warrant article or articles, by certified mail, to the commissioner of the department of revenue administration.  The petition to the superior court shall include a certification that the commissioner of the department of revenue administration has been notified pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event that the legislative body at an annual meeting amends or rejects the cost items or fact finder's reports as submitted pursuant to RSA 273-A, notwithstanding paragraphs I and II, the selectmen may call one special meeting for the sole purpose of addressing all negotiated cost items without petitioning the superior court for authorization.  Such special meeting may be authorized only by a contingent warrant article inserted on the warrant or official ballot either by petition or by the governing body.  The wording of the question shall be as follows:  "Shall (the local political subdivision), if article __________ is defeated, authorize the governing body to call one special meeting, at its option, to address article __________ cost items only?''  The refusal of the legislative body to authorize a special meeting as provided in this paragraph shall not affect any other provision of law.  Any special meeting held under this paragraph shall be combined with the revised operating budget meeting under RSA 40:13, XI, if any, and shall not be counted toward the number of special meetings which may be held in a given calendar or fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the selectmen vote to petition the superior court for permission to hold a special town meeting, the selectmen shall post notice of such vote within 24 hours after taking the vote and a minimum of 10 days prior to filing the petition with the court.  The selectmen shall post notice of the court date for an evidentiary hearing on the petition within 24 hours after receiving notice of the court date from the court.  Such notices shall be posted at the office of the selectmen and at 2 or more other conspicuous places in the town, and in the next available edition of a local newspaper with a wide circulation in the town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:5-b Legalization of Meetings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the past, irregularities and procedural defects in actions of municipal legislative bodies have been cured by actions of the general court.  The procedure in this section is an alternative approach which enables municipalities to effect legalization by local action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the legislative body of a municipality has voted by the requisite majority, by written ballot or in any other manner legally authorized, to take any legal actions and the vote is subsequently discovered to be procedurally defective, such defects may be cured and legalized by a vote at a special meeting called for the purpose of ratifying the procedurally defective action.  Procedurally defective actions shall mean minor procedural irregularities such as failure to comply with statutory requirements regarding time or place of notice, vote, hearing, or wording, or with any procedural act not contrary to the spirit or intent of the law.  The ratification of the procedurally defective action shall be subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The municipality may, on the authority of the governing body, call a special town meeting for the exclusive purpose of curing such defect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The special town meeting called for that purpose may not take place less than 21 calendar days after the original vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Not less than 7 calendar days prior to the special town meeting, not counting the day of the special town meeting, the governing body shall conduct a public hearing at which the reasons for the special town meeting shall be explained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The municipality shall comply with all statutory notice and procedural requirements for holding special town meetings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The necessary majority required to cure the defects shall be the same as the majority as required for passage of the original article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When any procedural defect has been cured under this section, actions of the voters shall be valid as if all statutorily required proceedings had been complied with.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:19-a Trust Funds Created by Towns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A town may at any annual or special meeting grant and vote such sums of money as it deems necessary to create trust funds for the maintenance and operation of the town;  and any other public purpose that is not foreign to the town's institution or incompatible with the objects of its organization.  The town may appoint agents to expend any funds in the trust for the purposes of the trust.  An annual accounting and report of the activities of the trust shall be presented to the selectmen and published in the annual report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Trust funds created pursuant to this section shall be revocable by majority vote of the legal voters present and voting at any annual meeting, unless the vote creating the trust expressly provides that the trust shall be irrevocable, and upon revocation the trustees of trust funds holding the account for said trust shall pay all the moneys in such fund to the town treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any trust fund created under this section shall be subject to the same provisions concerning custody, investment, expenditure, change of purpose, and audit as are reserve funds established under RSA 34:1, 34:1-a, 35:1 or 35:1-c.  The legal validity of such a fund properly established shall not be affected by its designation as a "trust,'' "reserve,'' "capital reserve,'' or any other designation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The local legislative body may authorize the acceptance of privately donated gifts, legacies, and devises to be utilized for the same purposes as a trust fund created under this section;  provided, however, that such gifts, legacies, or devises shall be invested and accounted for separately from, and not commingled with, amounts appropriated under paragraph I, and shall be subject to the custody and investment provisions applicable to trust funds accepted under RSA 31:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A trust fund created under the provisions of this section that is established for the purpose of maintaining health insurance funds for the benefit of employees and retired employees of any town shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 35:8 or 34:4, and, when so established, the town may name its own trustees who may expend any funds in the trust for the payment of health claims or health insurance premiums for the benefit of any employees or retired employees of the town.  An annual accounting and report of the activities of the trust shall be presented to the selectmen and published in the annual report.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:19-b Deferred Compensation Plan Trusts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "eligible employer'' means a governing body of a political subdivision, and any instrumentality whose income is exempt from federal taxation under section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All eligible employers are authorized to adopt resolutions establishing deferred compensation plans for their employees under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;  and, further, establishing trusts, custodial accounts, or annuity contracts described in section 401(f) of the Internal Revenue Code to receive all assets and income of deferred compensation plans for the exclusive benefit of employee and retiree participants and their beneficiaries as required by section 457(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary, all Internal Revenue Code section 457(b) deferred compensation plans adopted and all Internal Revenue Code section 457(g) trusts, accounts, or contracts created by any eligible employer after August 20, 1996, which meet the requirements of this section, are hereby deemed to be qualifying deferred compensation plans under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The eligible employer which establishes a deferred compensation plan trust under section 457(g) of the Internal Revenue Code is hereby authorized to serve as a trustee of such trust and is further authorized to appoint an administrator to administer the deferred compensation plan trust and receive all plan assets and income for such purposes.  An administrator may be within or outside the state so long as it administers a deferred compensation plan trust which qualifies as an Internal Revenue Code section 457(b) deferred compensation plan and an Internal Revenue Code section 457(g) trust account or contract.  Any appointments made after August 20, 1996 of administrators and investments of plan assets in trusts created by those administrators that meet the requirements of this section are hereby ratified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All amounts deferred under an Internal Revenue Code section 457(b) plan, after a trust has been established, shall be transferred to the trust within a period that is not longer than is reasonably necessary for the proper administration of the accounts of participants.  All assets and income held in any deferred compensation plan trust established under this section shall be held, managed, and invested for the exclusive benefit of employee and retiree participants and their beneficiaries and shall not be diverted to any other purpose including any debt or obligation of the eligible employer under state or federal law.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:19-c Authorization for Municipalities to Establish OPEB Trusts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislative body of a municipality that created, on or before January 1, 2012, an actuarial liability to pay other post-employment benefits (OPEB) to employees or officers after their termination of service may establish an irrevocable trust to pay those benefits.  In this section, the term "other post-employment benefits'' means employee benefits other than pensions that are received after employment ends, and may include such medical, disability, or other health benefits, as are covered by Statement No. 45 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).  The term "trust'' means a trust qualified under GASB Statement No. 43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Deposits to any fund under such a trust and any earnings on those deposits shall be irrevocable and shall be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of retirees and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the plans or programs providing other post-employment benefits, except that funds governed by the trust may be withdrawn for other purposes only when an employer's liability owed to former officers or employees for other post-employment benefits has been satisfied or otherwise eliminated pursuant to subparagraph V(b).  The assets of any trust created pursuant to this section or in which a municipality participates pursuant to this section shall be exempt from taxation and execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other process.  No public officer, employee, or agency shall divert, use, or authorize the use of such funds for any purpose other than as provided in law for other post-employment benefits covered by the trust and administrative expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The trustees of any trust created pursuant to this section shall have the full power to invest, reinvest, and manage the assets of the trust.  The trustees shall invest the assets of the trust with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.  The trustees shall also diversify such investments so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.  The board of trustees may engage a trust administrator, investment consultants, or other qualified professionals to assist with management and investment of the funds of the trust and may pay for these services out of the funds of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Trusts created by a municipality pursuant to this section shall by administered by the board of trustees established by the municipality pursuant to RSA 31:22.  The accounts of the trustees shall be subject to the auditing and reporting requirements of RSA 31:33.  Other provisions of RSA 31:19 through 31:38-a governing trusts shall also apply unless they are contrary to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The municipality may withdraw money from the funds of a trust created pursuant to this section only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As needed to pay other post-employment benefits owed to former officers and employees;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When all other post-employment benefits liability owed to former officers or employees of the employing entity has been satisfied or otherwise defeased.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:39-c Administrative Enforcement of Ordinances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a town may use the following provisions in the enforcement of its ordinances and regulations:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any town may establish, by ordinance adopted by the legislative body, a system for the administrative enforcement of violations of any municipal code, ordinance, bylaw, or regulation and for the collection of penalties, to be used prior to the service of a formal summons and complaint.  Such a system may be administered by a police department or other municipal agency.  The system may include opportunities for persons who do not wish to contest violations to pay such penalties by mail.  The system may also provide for a schedule of enhanced penalties the longer such penalties remain unpaid;  provided, however, that the penalty for any separate offense shall in no case exceed the maximum penalty for a violation as set forth in RSA 31:39, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A written notice of violation containing a description of the offense and any applicable schedule of penalties, delivered in person or by first-class mail to the last-known address of the offender, shall be deemed adequate service of process for purposes of any administrative enforcement system established under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the administrative enforcement system established under paragraph I is unsuccessful at resolving alleged violations, or in the case of a town that has not established such a system, a summons may be issued as otherwise provided by law, including use of the procedure for plea by mail set forth in RSA 31:39-d.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:39-d Local Ordinance Citations;  Pleas by Mail. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In addition to any other enforcement procedure authorized by law, and regardless of whether a town has adopted an administrative enforcement procedure under RSA 31:39-c, a local official with authority to prosecute an offense under any municipal code, ordinance, bylaw, or regulation, if such offense is classified as a violation under applicable law, may issue and serve upon the defendant, in addition to a summons to appear in the district court, a local ordinance citation as set forth in this section.  The defendant receiving such a citation may plead guilty or nolo contendere by mail by entering that plea as provided herein.  If such a plea is accepted by the district court and the prescribed fine is paid with the plea by mail, the defendant shall not be required to appear personally or by counsel;  otherwise the defendant shall appear as directed by the court.  The following procedure shall be used:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a complaint and summons may be served upon the defendant by postpaid certified mail, return receipt requested.  Return receipt showing that the defendant has received the complaint and summons shall constitute an essential part of the service.  If service cannot be effected by certified mail, then the court may direct that service on the defendant be completed as in other violation complaints.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The local ordinance citation shall contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The caption:  "Local Ordinance Citation, Town (City) of __________''.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The name of the offender, and address if known to the prosecuting official.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The code, ordinance, bylaw, or regulation the offender is charged with violating.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The act or circumstances constituting the violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The place of the violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The date, if any, upon which the offender received written notice of the violation by the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The time and date, if any, upon which any further violation or continuing violation was witnessed subsequent to such written notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The amount of the penalty that is payable by the offender.  If the offense is a continuing one for which a penalty is assessed for each day the offense continues, the amount of the penalty shall be based on the number of days the violation has continued since the time notice was given to the offender, up to a maximum of 10 days' violation charged in one citation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Instructions informing the defendant that the defendant may answer the citation by mail or may personally appear in court upon the date on the summons, and instructing the defendant how to enter a plea by mail, together with either the amount of the penalty specified in the citation, or a request for a trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The address of the clerk of the district court where the plea by mail may be entered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) A warning to the defendant that failure to respond to the citation on or before the date on the summons may result in the defendant's arrest as provided in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) The signature of the prosecuting official.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Defendants who are issued a summons and local ordinance citation and who wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere shall enter their plea on the summons and return it with payment of the civil penalty, as set forth in the citation, to the clerk of the court prior to the arraignment date, or shall appear in court on the date of arraignment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Civil penalties collected by the district court under this section shall be remitted to the municipality issuing the citation.  Whenever a defendant (a) does not enter a plea by mail prior to the arraignment day and does not appear personally or by counsel on or before that date or move for a continuance;  or (b) otherwise fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance in connection with a summons for any offense, the defendant shall be defaulted and the court shall determine what the civil penalty would be upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and shall impose an administrative processing fee in addition to the civil penalty.  Such fee shall be the same as the administrative processing fee under RSA 502-A:19-b, and shall be retained by the court for the benefit of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court may, in its discretion, issue a bench warrant for the arrest of any defendant who:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is defaulted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph IV of this section;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fails to pay a fine or other penalty imposed in connection with a conviction for a violation of a local code, ordinance, bylaw, or regulation which a court has determined the defendant is able to pay, or issues a bad check in payment of a fine or other penalty;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Fails to comply with a similar order on any matter within the court's discretion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For cause, the court in its discretion may refuse to accept a plea by mail and may impose a fine or penalty other than that stated in the local ordinance citation.  The court may order the defendant to appear personally in court for the disposition of the defendant's case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The prosecuting official may serve additional local ordinance citations, without giving additional written notice or appeal opportunity under paragraph I, if the facts or circumstances constituting the violation continue beyond the date or dates of any prior citation.  A plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the prior citation shall not affect the rights of the defendant with respect to a subsequent citation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Forms and rules for the local ordinance citation and summons shall be developed and adopted by the New Hampshire supreme court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. This section is not intended in any way to abrogate other enforcement actions or remedies in the district or superior court, nor to require written notice as a prerequisite to other types of actions or remedies for violations of local codes, ordinances, bylaws, or regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX-a. For any offense that is subject to enforcement under RSA 676:17, a person who fails to respond to a citation under this section within the time stated in the citation shall be subject to the subsequent offense penalties of RSA 676:17.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. This section shall not apply to violations of the New Hampshire building code as defined in RSA 155-A:1, IV, or to motor vehicle offenses under title XXI or any local law enacted thereunder.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Towns may, pursuant to RSA 31:95-d, vote to restrict revenues, or any portion of revenues, from a specific source to expenditures for specific purposes.  Such revenues and expenditures shall be accounted for in a special revenue fund separate from the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph IV, towns may establish, pursuant to RSA 31:95-d, special revenue funds to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide special highway funds from appropriate revenues, such as revenues from block grants from the state highway fund, motor vehicle permit fees collected under RSA 261:165, parking meter fees and fines in accordance with RSA 231:131, and any other highway related revenues not otherwise designated by law.  Appropriations from the special highway fund shall be used for highway expenditures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provide special capital improvement plan funds from appropriate revenues, which include any portion of town revenues otherwise allotted to the general fund except property taxes, provided that the town has adopted and has in place an up-to-date capital improvement plan as prescribed and developed in accordance with the provisions of RSA 674:5 through 674:8.  Any funds from sources includable in subparagraph (a) included in the capital improvement plan shall be used solely for highway purposes.  Appropriations from the special capital improvement plan fund shall be used to fund those individual capital projects identified in an up-to-date duly adopted town capital improvement plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any surplus in any fund created under paragraph I or II shall not be deemed part of the general fund accumulated surplus nor shall any surplus be expended for any purpose or transferred to any appropriation until such time as the legislative body shall have voted to appropriate a specific amount from said fund for a specific purpose related to the purpose or source of the revenue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the establishment of capital reserve funds pursuant to RSA 35:1 or town created trust funds pursuant to RSA 31:19-a.  The provisions of this section shall be limited to those town activities funded primarily through user fees including, but not limited to, municipal airports and solid waste facilities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31:95-d Procedure for Adoption;  Rescission or Change of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any town may adopt the provisions of RSA 31:95-c to restrict revenues, or any portion of such revenues, from a specific source to expenditures for specific purposes in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In a town, the question shall be placed on the warrant of a special or annual town meeting under the procedures set out in RSA 39:3, and shall be voted on by ballot.  The question shall not be placed on the official ballot.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The selectmen shall hold a public hearing on the question at least 15 days but not more than 30 days before the question is to be voted on.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the municipality and published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 7 days before the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall we adopt the provisions of RSA 31:95-c to restrict (here insert portion as a fractional or dollar amount) of revenues from (here insert source) to expenditures for the purpose of (here insert purpose)?  Such revenues and expenditures shall be accounted for in a special revenue fund to be known as the (...) fund, separate from the general fund.  Any surplus in said fund shall not be deemed part of the general fund accumulated surplus and shall be expended only after a vote by the legislative body to appropriate a specific amount from said fund for a specific purpose related to the purpose of the fund or source of the revenue.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes'', RSA 31:95-c shall apply within the town on a date set by the selectmen.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the question is not approved, the question may later be voted upon according to the provisions of RSA 31:95-d, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Any town which has adopted RSA 31:95-c may consider rescinding its action in the manner described in RSA 31:95-d, I(a) and (b).  The wording of the question shall be the same as set out in RSA 31:95-d, I(c), except the word "adopt'' shall be changed to "rescind.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes'', RSA 31:95-c shall not apply within the town, and any remaining amounts in the rescinded fund shall become part of the general fund accumulated surplus.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No change shall be made to a special revenue fund adopted under RSA 31:95-c unless the town has voted to consider changing the source or fractional portion of revenues or specific purpose of expenditures of the fund in the manner described in subparagraphs I(a) and (b) and authorized such change by a vote of  2/3 of all the voters present and voting at an annual town or district meeting.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any municipality may require persons who go from door to door, place to place within a town, or town to town, who sell, offer to sell, or take orders for merchandise or offer to perform personal services for household repairs or improvements, to submit to a state records check only, or both a federal and state records check.  Municipalities that require a criminal history records check shall have such person submit to the municipality a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  To obtain a federal records check, such person shall also submit to the municipality, with the release form, a complete set of fingerprints.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For a state and federal criminal records check, the municipality shall request that such person submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the department of safety.  The municipality shall submit the criminal history records release form and inked fingerprint card to the division of state police which shall conduct a criminal records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Fingerprints taken digitally by Live Scan or similar device shall be transmitted directly to the New Hampshire division of state police.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the municipality may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 10 years.  Upon completion of the records check, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal history records to the local law enforcement agency of the municipality which shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this section.  The municipality may charge a fee to recover the costs of such investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To obtain a state records check only, the municipality shall submit a state criminal history records release form, completed by such person, to the division of state police.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Such person shall also include the location of all municipalities in which such person seeks to transact business.  Such municipalities, in accordance with their licensing requirements, shall have access to the results of the criminal history records check and the New Hampshire division of state police shall release copies of the criminal history records to such municipalities.  Such person shall be responsible for any additional fees for any administrative costs incurred by the New Hampshire division of state police under this section.
