<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A town may, by vote of the legislative body, establish a revolving fund.  Each revolving fund shall be limited to one of the following purposes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Facilitating, maintaining, or encouraging recycling as defined in RSA 149-M:4;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Providing ambulance services;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Providing public safety services by municipal employees or volunteers outside of the ordinary detail of such persons, including but not limited to public safety services in connection with special events, highway construction, and other construction projects;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Creating affordable housing and facilitating transactions relative thereto;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Providing cable access for public, educational, or governmental use;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Financing of energy conservation and efficiency and clean energy improvements by participating property owners in an energy efficiency and clean energy district established pursuant to RSA 53-F.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a town establishes a revolving fund for any of the purposes listed in paragraph I, it may deposit into the fund all or any part of the revenues from fees, charges, or other income derived from the activities or services supported by the fund, and any other revenues approved by the legislative body for deposit into the fund.  The money in the fund shall be allowed to accumulate from year to year, and shall not be considered part of the town's general surplus.  The town treasurer shall have custody of all moneys in the fund, and shall pay out the same only upon order of the governing body, or other board or body designated by the local legislative body at the time the fund is created;  provided, that no further approval of the legislative body, if different from the governing body, shall be required.  Such funds may be expended only for the purposes for which the fund was created.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The legislative body may, at the time it establishes a revolving fund or at any time thereafter, place limitations on expenditures from the fund including, but not limited to, restrictions on the types of items or services that may be purchased from the fund, limitations on the amount of any single expenditure, and limitations on the total amount of expenditures to be made in a year.  No amount may be expended from a revolving fund established hereunder for any item or service for which an appropriation has been specifically rejected by the legislative body during the same year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The provisions of this section shall not preclude the establishment of a revolving fund for any other purpose authorized by law.
