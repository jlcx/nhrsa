&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31-A:4 Determination of Amounts Returnable. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The state treasurer shall distribute to the cities and towns each year the amount appropriated by the general court according to an equalized formula calculated by taking for each city and town the amount of local property taxes assessed, including current distributions of state revenues to local governments, exclusive of educational funds;  dividing that sum by the local equalized valuation as determined by the department of revenue administration;  and multiplying the result by the local population to produce an equalizing factor for each city and town.  Such equalizing factors shall be added together to produce a total state sum.  Each local equalizing factor shall be divided by the total state sum to produce for each city and town a normalized factor.  Each such normalized factor shall be multiplied by the total amount to be distributed to the cities and towns to produce the annual share of each city or town.  Under no circumstances shall the amount appropriated under this section be less than $47,300,000 annually.  Provided, however, that no city or town shall receive under the provisions of this section an amount less than the sum of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Its 1978 distribution under RSA 31-A plus its share under the equalized formula of an annual increase of 5 percent in the previous year's aggregate distribution, through the year 1981, excluding revenue derived from RSA 77-A:20.  The amount of money which is removed from the formula for deposit in the education trust fund shall not affect the remaining municipal revenue sharing distribution.  The same amount distributed to each municipality in fiscal year 1998, excluding the amount apportioned to the school district in the 1998 property tax calculations, shall be distributed to each municipality in fiscal year 1999 and each year thereafter until the legislature revises the formula or provides additional appropriations that will affect the distribution amount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Its 1982 distribution under the interest and dividends tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Its 1982 distribution under the savings bank tax.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 31-A:6 Alternate Procedure for Determination of Amounts Returnable in 1970. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Any town or city which claims that its equalized valuation of the property relieved from taxation by "An Act imposing a business profits tax, repealing certain taxes, providing transitional measures, revising the rate of certain taxes, and providing for return of revenue to cities and towns'' enacted by the 1970 special session of the general court, for the years 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969 increased by an average of more than 10 percent, may apply to the tax commission for a certificate to that effect.  After such investigation and hearing as the tax commission may require, which shall be conducted at the expense of the applicant, the commission shall, if it finds the application to have merit, certify to the state treasurer the average percentage rate of increase of equalized valuation of said property in said years.  The state treasurer shall determine the amount of revenue returnable to the applicant in 1970 by increasing the amount certified to him under RSA 31-A:2 by the percentage certified to him by the tax commission under this section.
