I. The authority shall have the power to enter into contracts and agreements which it considers to be in the interests of its public purposes with any person or persons, with any public or quasi-public corporation with any state, and with the United States and any department or agency thereof.  It shall have power (here stated in illustration and not in limitation of its power), to enter into agreements for the joint use of any property and rights by the authority and by any public utility operating any transportation facilities;  to enter into agreements with any public utility operating any transportation facilities either within or without the metropolitan area for the joint use of any property of the authority or public utility, or the establishment of through routes, joint fares and transfer of passengers;  and to enter into agreements with any person, or public corporation or quasi-public corporation for the maintenance, servicing, storage, operation or use of any transit facility, property or equipment on such basis as shall seem to the authority consonant with its public purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The authority may make contracts, leases and agreements with any department or agency of the United States of America or of the state of New Hampshire, or with any person or municipality or labor union, and may generally perform all acts necessary for the full exercise of the powers vested in it.  The authority may acquire rolling stock or other property under conditional sales contracts, leases, equipment, trust certificates, or any other form of contract or trust agreement.  Contracts may be let by an officer or employee of the authority or by the superintending corporation in such manner as may be authorized from time to time by the authority.  Any revenue bond indenture may provide limitations upon the exercise of the powers stated in this section and such limitations shall apply so long as any of the revenue bonds issued pursuant to such indenture are outstanding and unpaid.
