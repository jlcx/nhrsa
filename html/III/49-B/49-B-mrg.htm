<center><h3>Section 49-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 49-B:1 Purpose and Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the home rule powers recognized by article 39, part first, of the constitution of the state of New Hampshire.  To that end, the general court hereby provides a vehicle whereby a municipality may adopt a form of government that best addresses local needs.  At the same time, however, the general court recognizes a need to require uniform procedures and practices when there is a corresponding state interest.  Therefore, this chapter is intended only to provide a procedural framework by which a city or town may amend its actual form of government.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any power in, or confer any power upon, any city or town beyond that necessary to carry out the amendment of a charter or form of government as set forth in this chapter.  The general laws of this state shall remain in full force and effect, and they shall be construed to be consistent with this chapter to the greatest extent possible in the effectuation of this chapter's stated purpose.  Accordingly, this chapter shall be strictly interpreted to allow towns and cities to adopt, amend, or revise a municipal charter relative to their form of government so long as the resulting charter is neither in conflict with nor inconsistent with the general laws or the constitution of this state.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The superior court may, upon petition of 10 voters of the municipality or on petition of the attorney general, enforce this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A petition for declaratory relief may be brought on behalf of the public by the attorney general or, by leave of the court, by 10 voters of the municipality.  In the case of petition of 10 voters, the attorney general shall be served with notice of the preliminary petition for leave, and may intervene as a party at any stage of the proceedings;  and the petitioners shall be liable for, but may in the court's discretion also be awarded costs, which may include reasonable attorney's fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Judicial review to determine the validity of the procedures whereby any charter is adopted, revised or amended may be had by petition of 10 voters of the municipality brought within 30 days after the election at which such charter, revision or amendment is approved.  If no such petition is filed within such period, compliance with all the procedures required by this chapter and the validity of the manner in which such charter adoption, revision or amendment was approved shall be conclusively presumed.  No charter adoption, revision or amendment shall be deemed invalid on account of any procedural error or omission unless it is shown that the error or omission materially and substantially affected such adoption, revision or amendments.

IV. Any municipality aggrieved by the decision of the secretary of state under RSA 49-B:5-a may seek review by way of appeal in superior court to determine the lawfulness of the secretary's decision.  The clerk shall schedule a hearing on any such appeal within 10 days of the filing of such petition.
