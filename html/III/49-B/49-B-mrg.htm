<center><h3>Section 49-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 49-B:1 Purpose and Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the home rule powers recognized by article 39, part first, of the constitution of the state of New Hampshire.  To that end, the general court hereby provides a vehicle whereby a municipality may adopt a form of government that best addresses local needs.  At the same time, however, the general court recognizes a need to require uniform procedures and practices when there is a corresponding state interest.  Therefore, this chapter is intended only to provide a procedural framework by which a city or town may amend its actual form of government.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any power in, or confer any power upon, any city or town beyond that necessary to carry out the amendment of a charter or form of government as set forth in this chapter.  The general laws of this state shall remain in full force and effect, and they shall be construed to be consistent with this chapter to the greatest extent possible in the effectuation of this chapter's stated purpose.  Accordingly, this chapter shall be strictly interpreted to allow towns and cities to adopt, amend, or revise a municipal charter relative to their form of government so long as the resulting charter is neither in conflict with nor inconsistent with the general laws or the constitution of this state.

Within 30 days after submission of its final report the charter commission shall file with the clerk a complete account of all its receipts and expenditures for public inspection.  Any balance remaining in its account shall be credited to the municipality's surplus account.
<br>

The commission may, but is not required to, provide a draft of its preliminary report at the latter hearing.  Notice of each such hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the municipality and published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least 7 days before the date of the meeting.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) The charter commission shall file with the municipal clerk a preliminary report including the text of the charter which the commission intends shall be submitted to the voters and any explanatory information the commission deems desirable, and shall provide sufficient copies of the preliminary report to the municipal clerk to permit its distribution to each voter requesting it.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 10 days after the filing of the report relative to any charter amendment, if initiated by the municipal officers, the municipal clerk shall file a certified copy of the report.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon receiving notice of such objections, the charter commission may make such changes as appear necessary and resubmit the proposed charter within 30 days to the official or officials who raised the objections.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The following procedure shall be used in the alternative method set out in paragraph II:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any 5 voters of the municipality may file with the municipal clerk an affidavit stating that they shall constitute a petitioners' committee.  Such affidavit shall be signed by the members of such committee and an additional 20 voters of the municipality and shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The language of each proposed amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The names and addresses of the committee members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The address to which all notices to the committee are to be sent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The petitioners' committee, or voters of the municipality designated by the committee, may circulate the petition and file it in proper form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Promptly after the affidavit is filed by the petitioners' committee, the clerk shall file a certified copy of the affidavit, including the proposed amendment, for review of the proposed amendment in accordance with RSA 49-B:4-a.  Promptly after receiving approval of the proposed amendment from the state officials under RSA 49-B:4-a, the clerk shall issue petition blanks to the committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The petition forms shall read substantially as follows:  "Each of the undersigned voters respectfully requests the municipal officers to provide for the amendment(s) of the municipal charter as set out below.''  If more than one subject is included in a petition, each subject shall be addressed in a separate amendment.  Each signature affixed to a petition shall be in ink or other indelible instrument and shall be followed by the place of domicile of the voter with street and number, if any.  No petition shall contain any party or political designation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The clerk shall note the date of each petition form issued and all petitions, unless sooner filed, shall become null and void for every purpose on the 120th day after the date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each petition form shall have printed on its back an affidavit to be executed by the circulator, stating that he personally circulated the paper, the number of signatures thereon, that all the signatures were affixed in his presence, that he believes them to be genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be, that each signer has signed no more than one petition, and that each signer had an opportunity before signing to read the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Petition forms shall be assembled as one instrument and filed at one time with the clerk.  The clerk shall note thereon the date of filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 20 days after the petition is filed, the clerk shall complete a certificate as to its sufficiency, specifying, if it is insufficient, the particulars wherein it is defective, shall promptly send a copy of the certificate to the petitioners' committee by mail, and shall file a copy with the municipal officers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A petition certified insufficient for lack of the required number of valid signatures may be amended once if the petitioners' committee files a notice of intention to amend it with the clerk within 2 days after receiving the copy of his certificate.  Within 10 days after the date of filing of the notice of intention, the committee may file a supplementary petition to correct the deficiencies in the original petition.  Such supplementary petition shall in form and content comply with the requirements for an original petition under paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 5 days after the filing of a supplementary petition the clerk shall complete and file a certificate as to its sufficiency in the manner provided for in an original petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When an original or supplementary petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within 2 days after receiving the copy of the clerk's certificate, file a request with the municipal officers for review.  The municipal officers shall inspect the petitions and shall make due certificate thereof, copies of which shall be filed with the municipal clerk and mailed to the committee.  The certificate of the municipal officers shall be a final determination of the sufficiency of the petitions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any petitions finally determined to be insufficient shall be void.  Such petitions shall be stamped void by the clerk and shall be sealed and retained by the clerk in the manner required for secret ballots.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Within 10 days of receipt of a report that a petition is sufficient, the municipal officers shall by order provide for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.  The notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality at least 7 days prior to the hearing, and shall contain the text of the proposed amendment and a brief explanation.  The hearing shall be conducted by the municipal officers or a committee appointed by them;  provided that in the case of an amendment submitted by voter petition, the hearing shall be conducted by the municipal officers.  If, as a result of the public hearing, substantive changes are made to the proposed amendment, a second hearing shall be held.  Notice of the hearing and the conduct thereof shall be as provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 7 days after the last public hearing, the municipal officers or the committee appointed by them shall file with the municipal clerk a report containing the final draft of the proposed amendment and a written opinion by an attorney admitted to the bar of this state that the proposed amendment is not in conflict with the general laws or the constitution.  In the case of a committee report, a copy shall be filed with the municipal officers.  Upon such filing, the provisions of RSA 49-B:4-a shall apply in the same manner as for a charter adoption;  provided, however, that the municipal officers or the appointed committee shall be substituted for the charter commission for purposes of RSA 49-B:4-a, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Within 7 days after the approval by the secretary of state, the attorney general and the commissioner of the department of revenue administration, or within 7 days after the last public hearing in the case of an amendment submitted by voter petition, the municipal officers shall order the proposed amendment to be placed on the ballot at the next regular municipal election.  In the case of municipalities with biennial elections, the municipal officers shall order the amendments to be placed on the ballot at either the next regular municipal election or at a special municipal election that occurs not less than 60 days after the date of the order.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Judicial review to determine the validity of the procedures whereby any charter is adopted, revised or amended may be had by petition of 10 voters of the municipality brought within 30 days after the election at which such charter, revision or amendment is approved.  If no such petition is filed within such period, compliance with all the procedures required by this chapter and the validity of the manner in which such charter adoption, revision or amendment was approved shall be conclusively presumed.  No charter adoption, revision or amendment shall be deemed invalid on account of any procedural error or omission unless it is shown that the error or omission materially and substantially affected such adoption, revision or amendments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any municipality aggrieved by the decision of the secretary of state, the attorney general, or the commissioner of the department of revenue administration under RSA 49-B:4-a may seek review by way of appeal in superior court to determine the lawfulness of the decision.  The clerk shall schedule a hearing on any such appeal within 10 days of the filing of such petition.
