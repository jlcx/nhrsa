&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 49-B:6 Submission to Voters.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The method of voting at municipal elections when a question relating to a charter revision, a charter adoption, or a charter amendment is involved shall be in the manner prescribed for municipal elections.  In a town, the question shall appear on the ballot before any other questions except the election of officers.  In a city, the question shall appear in the order determined by the city clerk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of a charter revision or a charter adoption the question to be submitted to the voters shall include a summary prepared by the charter commission which explains both the current form of government used by the municipality and the changes in that form of government which will occur if the charter revision or charter is approved by the voters.  The question to be submitted to the voters shall be in substance as follows:
<br>
"Shall the municipality approve the (charter revision) (charter) recommended by the charter commission?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Subject to subparagraph (b), in the case of one or more charter amendments, each amendment shall be voted upon separately and the question to be submitted to the voters on each amendment shall be in substance as follows:
<br>
"Shall the municipality approve the charter amendment reprinted (summarized) below?''  Each such question shall be followed by the text or a summary of the amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Alternatively, at the discretion of the charter commission, 2 or more amendments may be listed and voted upon together.  In such case, the question shall be in substance as follows:
<br>
"Shall the municipality approve the charter amendments reprinted (summarized) below?''  The question shall be followed by the text or summary of each of the amendments that are being voted upon together.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) In the case of a charter revision or charter adoption, at least 2 weeks prior to the date of the election the municipal officers shall cause the final report of the charter commission to be printed, shall make copies available to the voters in the clerk's office, and shall post the report in the same manner that proposed ordinances are posted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of one or more charter amendments, at least 2 weeks prior to the date of the election, the municipal officers shall cause the proposed amendment and any summary thereof to be printed, shall make copies available to the voters in the clerk's office, and shall post the amendment and any summary thereof in the same manner that proposed ordinances are posted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If at least  3/5 of the ballots cast on any question under paragraph I favor acceptance, the new charter or the charter revision shall become effective as provided in subparagraph (a).  If a majority of the ballots cast on any question under paragraph II favor acceptance, the charter amendment shall become effective as provided in subparagraph (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Charter revisions, new charters, or repeals of charters adopted by the voters shall become effective immediately for the purpose of conducting necessary elections;  otherwise charter revisions, new charters, and repeals of charters shall become effective on the first day of the next succeeding municipal year or as specified in any transition provisions of the charter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Charter amendments adopted by the voters shall become effective on the first day of the next succeeding municipal year or on a date determined by the municipal officers, whichever occurs first.
