&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The municipal officers may determine that one or more amendments to the municipal charter are necessary and, by order, provide for notice and hearing on them in the same manner as provided in RSA 49-B:5, V(a).  Within 7 days after receiving approval from the secretary of state, the attorney general, and the commissioner of the department of revenue administration under RSA 49-B:4-a, the municipal officers may order the proposed amendment to be placed on a ballot at the next regular municipal election.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Alternative statements of a single amendment are prohibited.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The language of each proposed amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The names and addresses of the committee members.
<br>

(c) Promptly after the affidavit is filed by the petitioners' committee, the clerk shall file a certified copy of the affidavit, including the proposed amendment, for review of the proposed amendment in accordance with RSA 49-B:4-a.  Promptly after receiving approval of the proposed amendment from the state officials under RSA 49-B:4-a, the clerk shall issue petition blanks to the committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The petition forms shall read substantially as follows:  "Each of the undersigned voters respectfully requests the municipal officers to provide for the amendment(s) of the municipal charter as set out below.''  If more than one subject is included in a petition, each subject shall be addressed in a separate amendment.  Each signature affixed to a petition shall be in ink or other indelible instrument and shall be followed by the place of domicile of the voter with street and number, if any.  No petition shall contain any party or political designation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The clerk shall note the date of each petition form issued and all petitions, unless sooner filed, shall become null and void for every purpose on the 120th day after the date of issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each petition form shall have printed on its back an affidavit to be executed by the circulator, stating that he personally circulated the paper, the number of signatures thereon, that all the signatures were affixed in his presence, that he believes them to be genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be, that each signer has signed no more than one petition, and that each signer had an opportunity before signing to read the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Petition forms shall be assembled as one instrument and filed at one time with the clerk.  The clerk shall note thereon the date of filing.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A petition certified insufficient for lack of the required number of valid signatures may be amended once if the petitioners' committee files a notice of intention to amend it with the clerk within 2 days after receiving the copy of his certificate.  Within 10 days after the date of filing of the notice of intention, the committee may file a supplementary petition to correct the deficiencies in the original petition.  Such supplementary petition shall in form and content comply with the requirements for an original petition under paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 5 days after the filing of a supplementary petition the clerk shall complete and file a certificate as to its sufficiency in the manner provided for in an original petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When an original or supplementary petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within 2 days after receiving the copy of the clerk's certificate, file a request with the municipal officers for review.

The certificate of the municipal officers shall be a final determination of the sufficiency of the petitions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any petitions finally determined to be insufficient shall be void.  Such petitions shall be stamped void by the clerk and shall be sealed and retained by the clerk in the manner required for secret ballots.

The hearing shall be conducted by the municipal officers or a committee appointed by them;  provided that in the case of an amendment submitted by voter petition, the hearing shall be conducted by the municipal officers.  If, as a result of the public hearing, substantive changes are made to the proposed amendment, a second hearing shall be held.  Notice of the hearing and the conduct thereof shall be as provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Within 7 days after the last public hearing, the municipal officers or the committee appointed by them shall file with the municipal clerk a report containing the final draft of the proposed amendment and a written opinion by an attorney admitted to the bar of this state that the proposed amendment is not in conflict with the general laws or the constitution.
