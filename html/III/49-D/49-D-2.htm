&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 49-D:2 Town Council--Town Manager. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As distinguished from adopting a city form of government described in RSA 49-C, a town may adopt a charter pursuant to RSA 49-B which abolishes the open town meeting and vests all legislative authority in a town council as the elected body or, in the alternative, vests authority to make appropriations in a budgetary town meeting.  A charter establishing this form may reserve authority by the voters, at a referendum, over amendments to land use ordinances pursuant to RSA 675 and approval of bond issues consistent with RSA 33.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A charter establishing this form of government shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Establish a legislative body as described in RSA 49-D:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provide for either the direct election by the voters or the selection by the elected body of a chair of the elected body and prescribe the term of office, powers and duties and other matters relative to the position.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide for the appointment by the town council of a chief administrative officer to be called a town manager or similar title.  This position shall head the administrative services of the town and shall be selected on the same basis, possess the same qualifications, be vested with the same authority, be charged with the responsibility and enjoy similar job security as town managers under RSA 37.
