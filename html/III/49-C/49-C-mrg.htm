<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Initiative procedures whereby voters may initiate ordinances by petition, require consideration of the petitioned ordinance by the elected body and, failing satisfactory consideration, require a referendum to enact the ordinance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Conflicts of interest so long as any provisions adopted are at least as stringent as the state general laws relative to conflicts of interest.
