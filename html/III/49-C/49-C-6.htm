<codesect>
The city clerk shall prepare the ballots to be used at the municipal elections.  Under charters providing for election by the Australian ballot system, the ballots shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure provided for in general election laws governing such system.  Under charters providing for non-partisan elections, the ballot shall contain the names in alphabetical order by surname according to the alphabetization procedure established in RSA 656:5-a, without party designation, of all who file with the city clerk as candidates for elective office.  The charter shall specify a filing period, the filing fee to be paid for each office, and, as an alternative method of becoming a candidate on the ballot, the number of qualified voters which may be subscribed to a nominating petition in such form as the charter may set out.
