(a) Operating budget'' as used in this subdivision means budget,'' as defined in RSA 32:3, III, exclusive of special warrant articles,'' as defined in RSA 32:3, VI, and exclusive of other appropriations voted separately.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) Default budget'' as used in this subdivision means the amount of the same appropriations as contained in the operating budget authorized for the previous year, reduced and increased, as the case may be, by debt service, contracts, and other obligations previously incurred or mandated by law, and reduced by one-time expenditures contained in the operating budget.  For the purposes of this paragraph, one-time expenditures shall be appropriations not likely to recur in the succeeding budget, as determined by the governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, of the local political subdivision.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX. If no operating budget article is adopted, the local political subdivision either shall be deemed to have approved the default budget or the governing body may hold a special meeting pursuant to paragraph XVI to take up the issue of a revised operating budget only;  provided that RSA 31:5 and RSA 197:3 shall not apply to such a special meeting.  If no operating budget article is adopted the estimated revenues shall nevertheless be deemed to have been approved.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXI.

The governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, shall complete a default budget form created by the department of revenue administration to demonstrate how the default budget amount was calculated.

However, this amount may be adjusted by the governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, acting on relevant new information at any time before the ballots are printed, provided the governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, completes an amended default budget form.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) The wording of the second session ballot question concerning the operating budget shall be as follows:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShall the (local political subdivision) raise and appropriate as an operating budget, not including appropriations by special warrant articles and other appropriations voted separately, the amounts set forth on the budget posted with the warrant or as amended by vote of the first session, for the purposes set forth therein, totaling $____________? Should this article be defeated, the default budget shall be $ __________, which is the same as last year, with certain adjustments required by previous action of the (local political subdivision) or by law;  or the governing body may hold one special meeting, in accordance with RSA 40:13, X and XVI, to take up the issue of a revised operating budget only.''<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXI-a. If a political subdivision maintains a separate fund for the revenues and expenditures related to the operation, maintenance, and improvement of a water or sewer system, and if any appropriation for such fund is to be raised through user fees or charges and is included in a warrant article separate from the operating budget, the warrant article may include a default amount for such appropriation, which shall be deemed to have been approved if the proposed appropriation is not approved.  The default amount shall be determined by the governing body, or by the budget committee if the political subdivision has adopted the provisions of RSA 40:14-b, and shall equal the amount of the same appropriation for the preceding fiscal year, reduced and increased, as the case may be, by debt service, contracts, and other obligations previously incurred or mandated by law, and reduced by one-time expenditures contained in the previous year's appropriation.  The warrant article shall state the default amount for the appropriation and shall state that if the appropriation proposed in the article is not approved, the default amount shall be deemed to have been approved.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXII. Voting at the second session shall conform to the procedures for the nonpartisan ballot system as set forth in RSA 669:19-29, RSA 670:5-7 and RSA 671:20-30, including all requirements pertaining to absentee voting, polling place, and polling hours.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIII. Approval of all warrant articles shall be by simple majority except for questions which require a  2/3 vote by law, contract, or written agreement.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIV. Votes taken at the second session shall be subject to recount under RSA 669:30-33 and RSA 40:4-c.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXV. Votes taken at the second session shall not be reconsidered.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXVI. The warrant for any special meeting shall prescribe the date, place and hour for both a first and second session.  The second session shall be warned for a date not fewer than 28 days nor more than 60 days following the first session.  The first and second sessions shall conform to the provisions of this subdivision pertaining to the first and second sessions of annual meetings.  Special meetings shall be subject to RSA 31:5, 39:3, 195:13, 197:2, and 197:3, provided that no more than one special meeting may be held to raise and appropriate money for the same question or issue in any one calendar year or fiscal year, whichever applies, and further provided that any special meeting held pursuant to paragraphs X and XI shall not be subject to RSA 31:5 and RSA 197:3 and shall not be counted toward the number of special meetings which may be held in a given calendar or fiscal year.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXVII. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the sole purpose of a special meeting is to consider the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a zoning ordinance, historic district ordinance, or building code pursuant to RSA 675, including the adoption of an emergency zoning and planning ordinance pursuant to RSA 675:4-a, the meeting shall consist of only one session, which shall be for voting by official ballot on the proposed ordinance, code, amendment, or repeal.  The warrant for the meeting shall be posted in accordance with RSA 39:5.">

The second session of the annual meeting, to elect officers of the local political subdivision by official ballot, to vote on questions required by law to be inserted on said official ballot, and to vote on all warrant articles from the first session on official ballot, shall be held on the second Tuesday in March, the second Tuesday in April, or the second Tuesday in May, as applicable.  Notwithstanding RSA 669:1, 670:1, or 671:2, the second session shall be deemed the annual election date for purposes of all applicable election statutes including, but not limited to, RSA 669:5, 669:19, 669:30, 670:3, 670:4, 670:11, 671:15, 671:19, and 671:30 through 32;  and votes on zoning ordinances, historic district ordinances, and building codes under RSA 675.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII-a. When a topical description of the substance of a proposed ordinance or amendment to an ordinance is to be placed on the official ballot, an official copy of the proposed ordinance or amendment, including any amendment to the proposal adopted the first session, shall be placed on file and made available to the public at the office of the clerk of the political subdivision not later than one week prior to the date of the second session of the annual meeting.  An official copy of the proposed ordinance or amendment shall be on display for the voters at the meeting place on the date of the meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The clerk of the local political subdivision shall prepare an official ballot, which may be separate from the official ballot used to elect officers, for all warrant articles.  Wording shall be substantively the same as the main motion, as it was made or amended at the first session, with only such minor textual changes as may be required to cast the motion in the form of a question to the voters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII-a. A question as to the adoption or amendment of an ordinance shall be in substantially the following form:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"Are you in favor of the adoption of (amendment to) the ordinance as proposed by the selectmen as follows:  (here insert text or topical description of proposed ordinance or amendment)?''  In the event that there shall be more than a single proposed amendment to an ordinance to be submitted to the voters at any given meeting, the issue as to the several amendments shall be put in the following manner:  "Are you in favor of the adoption of Amendment No.___ to the ordinance as proposed by the selectmen as follows:  (here insert text or topical description of proposed amendment)?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. (a) "Operating budget'' as used in this subdivision means "budget,'' as defined in RSA 32:3, III, exclusive of "special warrant articles,'' as defined in RSA 32:3, VI, and exclusive of other appropriations voted separately.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Default budget'' as used in this subdivision means the amount of the same appropriations as contained in the operating budget authorized for the previous year, reduced and increased, as the case may be, by debt service, contracts, and other obligations previously incurred or mandated by law, and reduced by one-time expenditures contained in the operating budget.  For the purposes of this paragraph, one-time expenditures shall be appropriations not likely to recur in the succeeding budget, as determined by the governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, of the local political subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If no operating budget article is adopted, the local political subdivision either shall be deemed to have approved the default budget or the governing body may hold a special meeting pursuant to paragraph XVI to take up the issue of a revised operating budget only;  provided that RSA 31:5 and RSA 197:3 shall not apply to such a special meeting.  If no operating budget article is adopted the estimated revenues shall nevertheless be deemed to have been approved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. (a) The default budget shall be disclosed at the first budget hearing held pursuant to RSA 32:5 or RSA 197:6.  The governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, shall complete a default budget form created by the department of revenue administration to demonstrate how the default budget amount was calculated.  The form and associated calculations shall, at a minimum, include the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Appropriations contained in the previous year's operating budget;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Reductions and increases to the previous year's operating budget;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) One-time expenditures as defined under subparagraph IX(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This amount shall not be amended by the legislative body.  However, this amount may be adjusted by the governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, acting on relevant new information at any time before the ballots are printed, provided the governing body, unless the provisions of RSA 40:14-b are adopted, completes an amended default budget form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The wording of the second session ballot question concerning the operating budget shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"Shall the (local political subdivision) raise and appropriate as an operating budget, not including appropriations by special warrant articles and other appropriations voted separately, the amounts set forth on the budget posted with the warrant or as amended by vote of the first session, for the purposes set forth therein, totaling $____________? Should this article be defeated, the default budget shall be $ __________, which is the same as last year, with certain adjustments required by previous action of the (local political subdivision) or by law;  or the governing body may hold one special meeting, in accordance with RSA 40:13, X and XVI, to take up the issue of a revised operating budget only.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI-a. If a political subdivision maintains a separate fund for the revenues and expenditures related to the operation, maintenance, and improvement of a water or sewer system, and if any appropriation for such fund is to be raised through user fees or charges and is included in a warrant article separate from the operating budget, the warrant article may include a default amount for such appropriation, which shall be deemed to have been approved if the proposed appropriation is not approved.  The default amount shall be determined by the governing body, or by the budget committee if the political subdivision has adopted the provisions of RSA 40:14-b, and shall equal the amount of the same appropriation for the preceding fiscal year, reduced and increased, as the case may be, by debt service, contracts, and other obligations previously incurred or mandated by law, and reduced by one-time expenditures contained in the previous year's appropriation.  The warrant article shall state the default amount for the appropriation and shall state that if the appropriation proposed in the article is not approved, the default amount shall be deemed to have been approved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Voting at the second session shall conform to the procedures for the nonpartisan ballot system as set forth in RSA 669:19-29, RSA 670:5-7 and RSA 671:20-30, including all requirements pertaining to absentee voting, polling place, and polling hours.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Approval of all warrant articles shall be by simple majority except for questions which require a  2/3 vote by law, contract, or written agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Votes taken at the second session shall be subject to recount under RSA 669:30-33 and RSA 40:4-c.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. Votes taken at the second session shall not be reconsidered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. The warrant for any special meeting shall prescribe the date, place and hour for both a first and second session.  The second session shall be warned for a date not fewer than 28 days nor more than 60 days following the first session.  The first and second sessions shall conform to the provisions of this subdivision pertaining to the first and second sessions of annual meetings.  Special meetings shall be subject to RSA 31:5, 39:3, 195:13, 197:2, and 197:3, provided that no more than one special meeting may be held to raise and appropriate money for the same question or issue in any one calendar year or fiscal year, whichever applies, and further provided that any special meeting held pursuant to paragraphs X and XI shall not be subject to RSA 31:5 and RSA 197:3 and shall not be counted toward the number of special meetings which may be held in a given calendar or fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the sole purpose of a special meeting is to consider the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a zoning ordinance, historic district ordinance, or building code pursuant to RSA 675, including the adoption of an emergency zoning and planning ordinance pursuant to RSA 675:4-a, the meeting shall consist of only one session, which shall be for voting by official ballot on the proposed ordinance, code, amendment, or repeal.  The warrant for the meeting shall be posted in accordance with RSA 39:5.
