&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any multi-town school district adopting the provisions of RSA 40:13 may vote to use additional polling places for the second session of the annual meeting.  The additional polling places shall be the regular polling places for town or city elections in each member town and city of the district.  The school district moderator shall supervise the election process and appoint an assistant moderator for each additional polling place.  The school district clerk shall appoint an assistant clerk for each additional polling place.  Each assistant moderator and assistant clerk shall be domiciled in the town covered by the additional polling place served by such assistant moderator or assistant clerk.  The powers and duties of the assistant moderator and the assistant clerk shall be the same as those of the moderator and the clerk at the central polling place except as otherwise provided in the election laws.  The inspectors of elections appointed as provided in RSA 658:2 shall be sworn in by the assistant moderator before entering upon their duties.  All additional costs resulting from the establishment of additional polling places shall be borne by the school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Paragraph I of this section may be adopted by any multi-town school district simultaneously with adoption of RSA 40:13 or any time after the adoption of RSA 40:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The school district shall place the question on the warrant of the annual meeting under the procedures set out in RSA 197:6, and the question shall be voted on by official ballot in accordance with the procedures established in RSA 671:20-30, including all requirements pertaining to absentee voting, polling places, and polling hours.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A public hearing shall be held by the school board on the question at least 15 days, but not more than 30 days, before the question is to be voted on.  The public hearing shall be held in each town or city embraced by the district.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in each town or city of multi-town districts, and published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 7 days prior to the date of the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall we adopt the provisions of RSA 40:15 to allow voting at additional polling places for the second session of the annual meeting?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a majority of those voting on the question vote "yes,'' and RSA 40:13 has also been adopted then RSA 40:15 shall apply within the district at the annual or special meeting next following.  Only votes in the affirmative or negative shall be included in the calculation of the majority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any multi-town school district which has adopted RSA 40:15 may consider rescinding its action in the manner described in RSA 40:15, III-VI.  The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall the provisions for additional polling places for the second session of the annual meeting under RSA 40:15 be rescinded so that the voting shall be held at a central location?''  A majority of those voting on the question shall be required to rescind the provisions of this section.  Only votes in the affirmative or negative shall be included in the calculation of the majority.
