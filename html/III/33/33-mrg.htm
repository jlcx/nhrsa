I. A municipality or county may authorize the issuance of refunding bonds in order to pay all or part of any issue of bonds called or to be called for redemption, including any redemption premium thereon, all or part of the interest coming due on or prior to the date on which the outstanding bonds are redeemed, and the costs of issuing and marketing the refunding bonds.  The authorization and issuance of refunding bonds shall be subject to the same requirements and provisions of law as would then be applicable to the authorization and issuance of the bonds being redeemed, as far as apt.  In a town, school district, or village district, but not in a city, such refunding bonds may be authorized by the governing body of such town, school district, or village district, notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 33:8.  In this case, the authorization of refunding bonds shall not be subject to RSA 33:8-a, provided that there shall be at least one public hearing concerning any proposed refunding bond issue in excess of $100,000 held before the governing body of the town, school district, or village district.  Notice of the time, place, and subject of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the town, school district, or village district at least 7 days before the hearing is held.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Refunding bonds shall be payable in installments, the first of which shall be not later than the earliest stated principal maturity date of the bonds being refunded and the last of which shall be not later than the last date on which the bonds being refunded could have been made payable under that law applicable to the bonds being refunded.  The installment payments of refunding bonds shall be arranged in accordance with RSA 33:2 except that any installment that is payable earlier than the date on which the first installment is required to be made payable may be in any amount.  The proceeds of refunding bonds, exclusive of any premium and accrued interest and any proceeds used to pay issuing or marketing costs, shall, upon their receipt, be paid immediately to the paying agent for the bonds which are to be called and prepaid;  and such paying agent shall hold such proceeds in trust until the bonds are redeemed.  While such proceeds are held in trust, they may be invested for the benefit of the municipality or county as may be provided in any other applicable law of the state of New Hampshire relating to the investment or deposit of municipal or county funds;  and the income derived from investment may be expended to pay the principal of and redemption premium, if any, on the refunded bonds and interest thereon until they are redeemed.  Refunding bonds issued in accordance with this section shall be subject to the same statutory limit of indebtedness, if any, as the bonds refunded;  provided, however, that upon the issuance of the refunding bonds, the bonds refunded shall no longer be counted in determining any limit of indebtedness of the municipality or county.

In the sole discretion of the municipality, it may extend the benefits of this bonding authority to one or more of the other potentially responsible parties at the superfund site.  If a municipality elects to extend such benefits, its governing body shall enter into agreements with such other potentially responsible parties, in such form as it shall deem appropriate, to provide for payments to the municipality to pay principal and interest and other related costs of the bonded indebtedness incurred by the municipality on behalf of the other party or parties.  For the purposes of this subdivision, "governing body'' means the board of selectmen in a town, the board of aldermen or council in a city or town with a town council, the school board in a school district or the village district commissioners in a village district, or when used to refer to unincorporated towns or unorganized places, or both, the county commissioners.

Cities and towns may incur debt in anticipation of the taxes of the financial year in which the debt is incurred, in order to pay current maintenance and operation expenses, and may issue notes therefor to an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the total tax levy during the preceding financial year, provided that after the tax levy of the current year has been determined any city or town may borrow an amount not exceeding in the aggregate the total tax levy of the city or town for the current financial year.  In order to meet necessary expenses which may arise during the period from the beginning of the financial year to the date of the annual town meeting, the treasurer of any town, with the approval of the selectmen, may issue notes, without a vote of the town therefor, to an aggregate principal amount not exceeding 30 percent of the total receipts from taxes during the preceding financial year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Village Districts.  Village districts may incur debt in anticipation of taxes and other revenue of the financial year in which the debt is incurred, in order to pay current maintenance and operation expenses, and may issue notes therefor to an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the total tax levy of the district during the preceding financial year.  In order to meet necessary expenses which may arise during the period from the beginning of the financial year to the date of the annual district meeting, the treasurer of any district with the approval of the governing board, may issue notes, without a vote of the district therefor, to an aggregate principal amount not exceeding 30 percent of the total tax levy during the preceding financial year.
<br>

III. All notes issued under authority of this section shall be general obligations.  They may be sold at discount and shall be payable not later than one year from their date.  Notes issued for a shorter period than one year may be refunded or renewed, pursuant to a vote or resolution of the governing board, or the city councils in the case of cities, by the issue of other notes maturing within the required period, provided, however, that the period from the date of issue of the original loan to the date of maturity of the refunding or renewal loan shall not be more than one year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A village district established pursuant to RSA 52:1 may apply to the town it is situated in for tax anticipation money before the tax rate has been established for the town if said district presents to the selectmen a district budget, approved at a properly constituted district meeting called for the purpose of approving a budget.  Towns may advance to any village district a share of any money borrowed by the town in anticipation of taxes, not exceeding the total approved budget amount to be paid to such district.  The town may charge the district a proportionate share of the interest due on that town's tax anticipation notes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For tax anticipation notes only, any town or village district at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing indefinitely until specific rescission of such authority the issuance of tax anticipation notes.  The following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such warrant article to be voted on shall read:  "Shall the town (or village district) accept the provision of RSA 33:7 providing that any town (or village district) at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing indefinitely, until specific rescission of such authority, the selectmen (or commissioners) to issue tax anticipation notes?''

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 33:8-c Alternate Procedure for Authorizing Town or Village District Bonds or Notes for Municipal Small Scale Power Facilities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. By a  2/3 vote, the governing board of a town or village district may call a special meeting for the purpose of authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes for the municipal financing of small scale power facilities, as such facilities are defined in RSA 374-D:1.  A special meeting held under this section shall have the same authority as that of an annual town meeting.  The issuance of such bonds or notes shall be authorized by a vote of  2/3 of all the voters present and voting at the special meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The warrant for such special meeting shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least once a week for 2 consecutive weeks after the posting of such warrant.  The warrant for such special meeting shall be served or posted at least 14 days before the date of the meeting.  Every warrant shall be deemed to have been duly served or posted, if the return on the warrant shall so state, and it shall be certified by the officer or officers required to serve or post the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. There shall be at least one public hearing concerning any such proposed municipal bond issue held before the governing board of the municipality, before a special meeting held to vote on such issue.  Said hearing shall be held at least 15 days, but not more than 60 days before the special meeting at which the bonds or notes to be issued are to be voted on.  Notice of the time, place, and subject of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least 7 days before it is held.  If a hearing is held under RSA 35:8-a or RSA 32, said hearing shall be sufficient for this purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All bonds or notes authorized in accordance with this section shall be signed by the governing board, or a majority of the board, and countersigned by the treasurer of the issuing municipality, and shall have the corporate seal, if any, affixed to such bonds or notes.  The discretion of fixing the date, maturities, denominations, the interest rate, or discount rate in the case of notes, the place of payment, the form and other details of said bonds or notes and of providing for their sale, may be delegated to the governing board or to the treasurer and shall, to the extent provision for such delegation shall not have been made in the authorizing vote, be deemed to have been delegated to the governing board.
