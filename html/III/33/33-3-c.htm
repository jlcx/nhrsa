A municipality or county may issue its bonds or notes in accordance with this section for planning and other preliminary expenses relating to solid waste disposal or resource recovery facilities to serve the municipality or county, notwithstanding that the facilities may later be owned by a private entity, but only for such expenses incurred prior to any binding contractual commitment to a proposed private owner, and only if such bonds or notes do not constitute "private activity bonds'' as defined in section 103(n)(7) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
