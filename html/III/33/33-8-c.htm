&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 33:8-c Alternate Procedure for Authorizing Town or Village District Bonds or Notes for Municipal Small Scale Power Facilities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. By a  2/3 vote, the governing board of a town or village district may call a special meeting for the purpose of authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes for the municipal financing of small scale power facilities, as such facilities are defined in RSA 374-D:1.  A special meeting held under this section shall have the same authority as that of an annual town meeting.  The issuance of such bonds or notes shall be authorized by a vote of  2/3 of all the voters present and voting at the special meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The warrant for such special meeting shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least once a week for 2 consecutive weeks after the posting of such warrant.  The warrant for such special meeting shall be served or posted at least 14 days before the date of the meeting.  Every warrant shall be deemed to have been duly served or posted, if the return on the warrant shall so state, and it shall be certified by the officer or officers required to serve or post the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. There shall be at least one public hearing concerning any such proposed municipal bond issue held before the governing board of the municipality, before a special meeting held to vote on such issue.  Said hearing shall be held at least 15 days, but not more than 60 days before the special meeting at which the bonds or notes to be issued are to be voted on.  Notice of the time, place, and subject of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least 7 days before it is held.  If a hearing is held under RSA 35:8-a or RSA 32, said hearing shall be sufficient for this purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All bonds or notes authorized in accordance with this section shall be signed by the governing board, or a majority of the board, and countersigned by the treasurer of the issuing municipality, and shall have the corporate seal, if any, affixed to such bonds or notes.  The discretion of fixing the date, maturities, denominations, the interest rate, or discount rate in the case of notes, the place of payment, the form and other details of said bonds or notes and of providing for their sale, may be delegated to the governing board or to the treasurer and shall, to the extent provision for such delegation shall not have been made in the authorizing vote, be deemed to have been delegated to the governing board.
