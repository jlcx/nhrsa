&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 33:5-a Water Works. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Municipalities may incur debt for supplying the inhabitants with water or for the construction, enlargement, or improvement of water works, by the issue of bonds or notes, for such purposes, as set forth in this chapter;  provided, however, that such municipalities shall not incur debt for such purposes to an amount, at any one time outstanding, exceeding 10 percent of their last locally assessed valuation as last equalized by the commissioner of revenue administration determined as provided in RSA 33:4-b.  Any municipality which shall have received orders from the department of environmental services under the provisions of RSA 485 requiring the alteration, enlargement, or application of any other improvement in such facilities as will ensure fitness and safety and adequate protection of the public health may incur debt thereof by the issue of bonds or notes outside the limit prescribed herein.  All debt authorized by this section, inasmuch as it is all excluded from the definition of "net indebtedness'' in RSA 33:1, shall at no time be included for the purpose of calculating the borrowing capacity of the municipality for other purposes.  The debt limits established by this section may be exceeded by a municipality in accordance with the procedure prescribed in and subject to the provisions of RSA 33:6.
