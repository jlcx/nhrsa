&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 33:4-b Debt Limit;  Computation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The debt limitations hereinbefore prescribed, except for counties, shall be based upon the applicable last locally assessed valuation of the municipality as last equalized by the commissioner of revenue administration under RSA 21-J:3, XIII and shall include the equalized value of property formerly taxed pursuant to the provisions of RSA 72:7;  72:15, I, V, VII, VIII, IX, X and XI;  72:16;  72:17;  73:26;  73:27 and 73:11 through 16 inclusive, all as amended, which was relieved from taxation by 1970, 5:3, 5:8 and 57:12, as determined under the provisions of RSA 71:11 as amended.  Whenever several municipalities possessing the power to incur indebtedness cover or extend over identical territory, each such municipality shall so exercise the power to incur indebtedness under the foregoing limitations so that the aggregate net indebtedness of such municipalities shall not exceed 9.75 percent of the valuation of the taxable property as hereinbefore determined, except as provided for cooperative school districts under RSA 195:6.  A written certificate signed by the commissioner of the department of revenue administration shall be conclusive evidence of the base valuation of municipalities for computing debt limits hereunder.
