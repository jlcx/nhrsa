Any such proceeds so pledged shall be deposited upon receipt in a segregated account to be held by the treasurer, or a corporate trustee designated by the treasurer, shall be applied without appropriation to the payment of such notes, and shall not be used for any other purpose until the notes and the interest on such notes are paid in full;  provided that any earnings derived from investment of moneys in the account shall be credited to the general fund of the city or town and shall be available for appropriation for any lawful purpose.
