I. Any trustee or trustees of trust funds having custody of capital reserve funds authorized by this chapter may contract with the trust department or departments of a bank, a brokerage firm, a portfolio management department, or investment advisor in the same manner and for the same purposes as described in RSA 31:38-a, III.  They may also place securities in the nominee name of a trust department of a bank, or departments, a brokerage firm, a portfolio management department, or investment advisor, to facilitate transfers for such securities.  Capital reserve fund records maintained by any bank, brokerage firm, portfolio management department, or investment advisor shall be available at all times for examination by local auditors, by independent accountants or auditors retained by a municipality, or by the auditors of the department of revenue administration;  and such records shall be municipal records and property.  In employing such trust departments of banks, brokerage firms, portfolio management departments, or investment advisor, the trustees may enter into contracts or agreements delegating the management of such capital reserve funds to those departments or brokerage firms subject to investment guidelines adopted by the trustees under applicable statutes and subject to at least quarterly review and approval of such management by the trustees.  For purposes of this section, the terms "bank,'' "brokerage firm,'' "portfolio management department'' and "investment advisor'' shall have the definitions set forth in RSA 31:38-a.

II. The town meeting may adopt an article authorizing the trustees of trust funds, without further action of the town meeting, to charge any expenses incurred pursuant to paragraph I against the capital reserve funds involved.  Such authority shall remain in effect until rescinded by a vote of the town meeting.  No vote by the town to rescind such authority shall occur within 5 years of the original adoption of such article.  In a town that has a town council, such authority may be granted by the town council and shall remain in effect until rescinded by the town council.  No vote by the town council to rescind such authority shall occur within 5 years of the original adoption of such article.  Any professional banking and brokerage fees incurred shall be reported in the annual report of the trustees of trust funds as expenditures out of capital reserve funds.
