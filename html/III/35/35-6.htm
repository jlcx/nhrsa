&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 35:6 Funds Received in Eminent Domain Proceedings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any town, school district, village district or county which may receive funds from the United States or any agency thereof in eminent domain proceedings for the taking of its property or other public facilities or in settlement for such taking or of claims for damages to its property or other public facilities, may vote to use said funds, under a proper article in the warrant in the case of a town, school district or village district or by vote of the county delegation in the case of a county, to establish a capital reserve fund under this chapter.  Funds so received shall not be subject to restriction as to investments prescribed in RSA 35:9 and may be invested in the same manner as trust funds under RSA 31:25.  Funds so received may, if so voted, be used to retire existing indebtedness as well as for the purposes specified in RSA 35:1.  In cases in which the United States or any agency thereof shall acquire a flowage easement in highways or bridges under the jurisdiction of a town, the town, if it votes to establish a capital reserve fund out of the funds received therefor from the United States or any agency thereof, may use such fund not only for capital improvements and capital expenditures as provided in RSA 35:1, but also for the maintenance, repair and reconstruction of the particular highways and bridges in which easements have been acquired or of such highways and bridges as may be provided in substitution therefor.
