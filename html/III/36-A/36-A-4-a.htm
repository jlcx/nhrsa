&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 36-A:4-a Optional Powers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The legislative body of a city or town may vote at an annual meeting to authorize the conservation commission to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Expend funds for the purchase of interests in land outside the boundaries of the municipality, subject to the approval of the local governing body;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Expend funds for contributions to "qualified organizations,'' as defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, for the purchase of property interests or facilitating transactions relative thereto to be held by the qualified organization, when such purchase carries out the purposes of this chapter.  Because such contributions further the protection of the state's natural resources, they are hereby declared to be a public purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A vote under this section may be taken simultaneously with the adoption of this chapter or any time thereafter.  If the vote is taken simultaneously with the adoption of this chapter, a separate question shall be placed on the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The wording of the question under subparagraph I(a) shall be:  "Shall the town vote to adopt the provisions of RSA 36-A:4-a, I(a) to authorize the conservation commission to expend funds to purchase interests in land outside the boundaries of our municipality, subject to the approval of the local governing body?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The wording of the question under subparagraph I(b) shall be:  "Shall the town vote to adopt the provisions of RSA 36-A:4-a, I(b) to authorize the conservation commission to expend funds for contributions to "qualified organizations' for the purchase of property interests, or facilitating transactions related thereto, where the property interest is to be held by the qualified organization and the town will retain no interest in the property?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of this section may be rescinded by vote of the legislative body.
