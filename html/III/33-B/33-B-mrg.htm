The authorized officers shall determine the form and details and the manner of execution of bonds.  The municipality or regional water district may sell its bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, for such price, at such rate or rates of interest, or at such discount in lieu of interest, as the authorized officers may determine.

Such trust or security agreement or resolution may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security and remedies of the bondholders as may, in the discretion of the authorized officers, be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.

Any such trust or security agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.
