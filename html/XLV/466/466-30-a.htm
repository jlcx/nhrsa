&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any dog to run at large, except when accompanied by the owner or custodian, and when used for hunting, for guarding, working, or herding livestock, as defined in RSA 21:34-a, II(a)(4), for supervised competition and exhibition, or for training for such.  For the purpose of this section, "accompanied'' means that the owner or custodian must be able to see or hear, or both, or have reasonable knowledge of where the dog is hunting, where training is being conducted, where trials are being held, or where the dog is guarding, working, or herding livestock.  Nothing herein provided shall mean that the dog must be within sight at all times.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In this section, "at large'' means off the premises of the owner or keeper and not under the control of any person by means of personal presence and attention as will reasonably control the conduct of such dog, unless accompanied by the owner or custodian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any authorized person may seize, impound or restrain any dog in violation of this section and deliver said dog to a person or shelter authorized to board dogs.  Such dogs shall be handled as strays or abandoned dogs pursuant to applicable laws.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition to impounding a dog found at large or in violation of this section, any local law enforcement officer may issue, in the name of the owner or keeper of such dog, a notice of violation for a nuisance dog pursuant to RSA 466:31, II(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The provisions of this section shall not be effective in any city or town unless adopted by a city or town pursuant to RSA 466:30-b.
