&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No fee shall be required for the registration and licensing of a dog which has served with the armed forces of the United States and has received an honorable discharge therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No fee shall be required for the registration and licensing of a service animal dog as defined in RSA 167-D:1, IV.  When registering and applying for a license for a dog that is a service animal, the owner or trainer shall present an identification card issued by a recognized dog training agency.  If a dog has been trained by its owner and does not have an identification card issued by a recognized dog training agency or school, in order to register and license a dog that is a service animal, the dog shall meet the minimum training standards for public access as set by the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners as determined by a service animal trainer, as defined in RSA 167-D:1, V, and the owner shall present a letter from a health care professional stating that the individual requires the use of a service animal to perform tasks directly related to his or her disability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The owner of a dog that is a service animal may elect for the registration and licensing of such dog to be permanent and not subject to annual renewal so long as such dog has met the requirements of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For the purpose of this section, the town clerk of each town or municipality shall determine the process by which permanently registered dogs that are service animals will be tracked for town purposes and ensure that town service animal owners are not required to participate, in any way, with an annual renewal of such dog's registration or licensing.  In cases of change of town of residency, the service animal owner shall re-register the dog at no cost.  If the owner has elected to obtain a tag through the governor's commission on disability as set forth in paragraph V, the owner shall let the governor's commission on disability know of any change in town of residency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Certificates and tags stamped "G C D--Permanent Registration'' with a registration number shall be issued by the governor's commission on disability to those who wish to affix such a tag on their service animal's collar after registering the dog under paragraph II.  Tags and certificates may be obtained directly from the governor's commission on disability which will verify with the town clerk that such dog has met the requirements under paragraph II and is duly registered and licensed by the town of residency.  Tags issued by the governor's commission on disability shall not be used to verify the legitimacy or authenticity of a service animal for any purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon the death or retirement of a service animal, the owner or person in possession of the service animal tag shall immediately return the tag to the governor's commission on disability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The tag identifying a service animal shall be used only by an eligible service animal, as defined in RSA 167-D:1, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The owners and trainers of dogs that are service animals shall comply with all state and local ordinances regarding rabies certification under RSA 436:102 and RSA 466:1-a.

The cost of service shall not exceed $7 and may be recovered by the city or town in addition to the amount of the civil forfeiture.  If the unlicensed dog is seized, it shall be held in a town or city holding facility for a period of 7 days, after which time full title to the dog shall pass to the facility, unless the owner of the dog has, before the expiration of the period, caused the dog to be licensed.  The owner shall pay the facility a necessary and reasonable sum per day, as agreed upon by the governing body of the town or city and the facility, for each day the dog has been kept and maintained by the facility, plus any necessary veterinary fees incurred by the facility for the benefit of the dog.  Before a local law enforcement officer seizes any unlicensed dog, a written warning shall be given to the dog owner.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any authorized person may seize, impound or restrain any dog in violation of this section and deliver said dog to a person or shelter authorized to board dogs.  Such dogs shall be handled as strays or abandoned dogs pursuant to applicable laws.
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Under this section, a dog is considered to be a nuisance, a menace, or vicious to persons or to property under any or all but not limited to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If a dog is "at large,'' which means it is off the premises of the owner or keeper and not under the control of any person by means of personal presence and attention as will reasonably control the conduct of such dog, unless accompanied by the owner or custodian.  This subparagraph shall not include a dog which is being used for hunting, supervised competition, exhibition, or training for such activities if accompanied by the owner or custodian, or a dog which is guarding, working, or herding livestock, as defined in RSA 21: 34-a, II(a)(4), meaning that the owner or custodian must be able to see or hear the dog, or have reasonable knowledge of where the dog is hunting or herding, or where training is being conducted or where trials are being held, provided that such dog does not have to be within sight at all time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If it barks for sustained periods of more than  1/2 hour, or during the night hours so as to disturb the peace and quiet of a neighborhood or area, not including a dog which is guarding, working, or herding livestock, as defined in RSA 21:34-a, II(a)(4);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If it digs, scratches, or excretes, or causes waste or garbage to be scattered on property other than its owner's;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If any female dog in season (heat) is permitted to run at large or be off the premises of the owner or keeper during this period except when being exercised on a leash by a responsible adult.  At all other times such dog shall be confined within a building or enclosure in such manner that she will not come in contact (except for intentional breeding purposes) with a male dog.  A female dog in heat shall not be used for hunting;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If it growls, snaps at, runs after, or chases any person or persons not on the premises of the owner or keeper;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If it runs after, or chases bicycles, motor vehicles, motorcycles, or other vehicles being driven, pulled or pushed on the streets, highways, or public ways;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) If, whether alone or in a pack with other dogs, it bites, attacks, or preys on game animals, domestic animals, fowl or human beings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. If the skin of a person has been punctured by a dog and the incident was reported, including the identity of the dog and its owner, to the animal officer, if any, or to the town clerk, such officer or clerk shall, within 24 hours, notify the injured person, or, in the case of a minor, the minor's parent or guardian, whether, according to town records, the dog has been appropriately immunized against rabies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Any person who fails, by appropriate action including but not limited to restraining an animal from running at large, or otherwise effectively abating a nuisance found such under the provisions of this section, or who fails to comply with any other provisions of this section after being so ordered, shall have the person's dog taken into custody by the police of the city, constable of the town, or other person authorized by the town and such disposition made of the dog as the court may order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding RSA 466:31-a, if a law enforcement officer does not witness the nuisance behavior, the name of the complainant shall be released as public information before any fine under RSA 466:31-a shall be levied.
