&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 466:14 Warrants;  Proceedings.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The town or city clerk shall annually, between June 1 and June 20, present to the local governing body a list of those owners of dogs that have failed to license or not renewed their dog licenses pursuant to RSA 466:1.  The local governing body shall, within 20 days from June 20, issue a warrant to a local official authorized to issue a civil forfeiture for each unlicensed dog.  The warrant may also authorize a local law enforcement officer to seize any unlicensed dog.  The civil forfeiture may be sent by certified mail, or delivered in hand, or left at the abode of the dog owner.  The cost of service shall not exceed $7 and may be recovered by the city or town in addition to the amount of the civil forfeiture.  If the unlicensed dog is seized, it shall be held in a town or city holding facility for a period of 7 days, after which time full title to the dog shall pass to the facility, unless the owner of the dog has, before the expiration of the period, caused the dog to be licensed.  The owner shall pay the facility a necessary and reasonable sum per day, as agreed upon by the governing body of the town or city and the facility, for each day the dog has been kept and maintained by the facility, plus any necessary veterinary fees incurred by the facility for the benefit of the dog.  Before a local law enforcement officer seizes any unlicensed dog, a written warning shall be given to the dog owner.
