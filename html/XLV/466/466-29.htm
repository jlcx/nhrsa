&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of a rabies epidemic, the mayor and aldermen of a city or the selectmen of a town may order that all dogs within the limits of the city or town shall be muzzled or restrained from running at large during the time prescribed by such order.  After passing the order, the governing body of such city or town shall post a certified copy of the order in 2 or more public places in the city or town, or, if a daily newspaper is published in the city or town, publish a copy at least once in the newspaper.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The mayor or aldermen or selectmen may issue their warrant to one or more of the police officers of such city or town who shall, after 24 hours from the publication of the notice required under paragraph I, impound all dogs found running at large contrary to such order.  The dog owner shall be notified, if the owner's identity is known.  Any dog impounded in accordance with this section who has been conclusively found to be rabid shall be destroyed in the most humane manner possible.  After 7 consecutive days of impoundment, title of a dog shall pass to the facility holding the dog, unless the owner has claimed such dog.  The owner of the dog shall be responsible for all costs associated with the impoundment of the dog under this section.
