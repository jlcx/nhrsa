&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 466:13 Forfeiture. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whoever is the owner or keeper of a dog and who fails to license or renew the dog license pursuant to RSA 466:1 shall forfeit $25 to the town or city clerk of the municipality in which the dog is kept.  If the forfeiture is not made to the town or city clerk within 15 calendar days of the notice of forfeiture, the case may be disposed of in a district court as a violation with a fine not to exceed $50, notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 651:2, IV. A forfeiture shall not relieve the owner or keeper of the requirement of proper licensing of the dog as required by RSA 466:1.  This section shall also apply to cats, if the municipality licenses cats.  Any forfeitures collected under this section may be retained by the city or town for the administration and enforcement of this chapter.
