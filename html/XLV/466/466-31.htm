<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If a dog is "at large,'' which means it is off the premises of the owner or keeper and not under the control of any person by means of personal presence and attention as will reasonably control the conduct of such dog, unless accompanied by the owner or custodian.  This subparagraph shall not include a dog which is being used for hunting, supervised competition, exhibition, or training for such activities if accompanied by the owner or custodian, or a dog which is guarding, working, or herding livestock, as defined in RSA 21: 34-a, II(a)(4), meaning that the owner or custodian must be able to see or hear the dog, or have reasonable knowledge of where the dog is hunting or herding, or where training is being conducted or where trials are being held, provided that such dog does not have to be within sight at all time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If it barks for sustained periods of more than  1/2 hour, or during the night hours so as to disturb the peace and quiet of a neighborhood or area, not including a dog which is guarding, working, or herding livestock, as defined in RSA 21:34-a, II(a)(4);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If it digs, scratches, or excretes, or causes waste or garbage to be scattered on property other than its owner's;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If any female dog in season (heat) is permitted to run at large or be off the premises of the owner or keeper during this period except when being exercised on a leash by a responsible adult.  At all other times such dog shall be confined within a building or enclosure in such manner that she will not come in contact (except for intentional breeding purposes) with a male dog.  A female dog in heat shall not be used for hunting;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If it growls, snaps at, runs after, or chases any person or persons not on the premises of the owner or keeper;

(f) If it runs after, or chases bicycles, motor vehicles, motorcycles, or other vehicles being driven, pulled or pushed on the streets, highways, or public ways;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) If, whether alone or in a pack with other dogs, it bites, attacks, or preys on game animals, domestic animals, fowl or human beings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. If the skin of a person has been punctured by a dog and the incident was reported, including the identity of the dog and its owner, to the animal officer, if any, or to the town clerk, such officer or clerk shall, within 24 hours, notify the injured person, or, in the case of a minor, the minor's parent or guardian, whether, according to town records, the dog has been appropriately immunized against rabies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Any person who fails, by appropriate action including but not limited to restraining an animal from running at large, or otherwise effectively abating a nuisance found such under the provisions of this section, or who fails to comply with any other provisions of this section after being so ordered, shall have the person's dog taken into custody by the police of the city, constable of the town, or other person authorized by the town and such disposition made of the dog as the court may order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
