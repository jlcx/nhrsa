&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 466:13-a Licensing of Cats. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The governing body of a municipality may vote to license cats in a similar manner as it licenses dogs.  If a municipality elects to license cats, the same penalties shall apply for unlicensed cats as for unlicensed dogs, and the provisions of RSA 466:8 of the preceding subdivision shall not apply to cats.  If a municipality elects to license cats, it shall also develop a procedure similar to the procedure in RSA 466:4, III and 466:6 for group licensure.  If a municipality elects to license cats, it shall require cats to have a form of identification, including, but not limited to a tattoo, collar, surgically implanted microchip or ear tag, or any other form approved by the commissioner of agriculture, markets, and food.  The commissioner of agriculture, markets, and food shall adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, relative to the forms of identification.
