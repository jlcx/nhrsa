&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-A:1 Declaration of Public Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared to be in the public interest to encourage the preservation of open space, thus providing a healthful and attractive outdoor environment for work and recreation of the state's citizens, maintaining the character of the state's landscape, and conserving the land, water, forest, agricultural and wildlife resources.  It is further declared to be in the public interest to prevent the loss of open space due to property taxation at values incompatible with open space usage.  Open space land imposes few if any costs on local government and is therefore an economic benefit to its citizens.  The means for encouraging preservation of open space authorized by this chapter is the assessment of land value for property taxation on the basis of current use.  It is the intent of this chapter to encourage but not to require management practices on open space lands under current use assessment.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Farm land'' means any cleared land devoted to or capable of agricultural or horticultural use as determined and classified by criteria developed by the commissioner of agriculture, markets, and food and adopted by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Forest land'' means any land growing trees as determined and classified by criteria developed by the state forester and adopted by the board.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the board shall recognize the cost of responsible land stewardship in the determination of assessment ranges.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Land use change tax'' means a tax that shall be levied when the land use changes from open space use to a non-qualifying use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. "Open space land'' means any or all farm land, forest land, or unproductive land as defined by this section.  However, "open space land'' shall not include any property held by a city, town or district in another city or town for the purpose of a water supply or flood control, for which a payment in place of taxes is made in accordance with RSA 72:11.

XII. "Soil potential index'' means the production capability of land as determined by the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. "Unproductive land'' means land, including wetlands, which by its nature is incapable of producing agricultural or forest products due to poor soil or site characteristics, or the location of which renders it inaccessible or impractical to harvest agricultural or forest products, as determined and classified by criteria developed by the board.  The board shall develop only one category for all unproductive land, setting its current use value not to exceed that of the lowest current use value established by the board for any other category.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. "Wetlands'' means those areas of farm, forest and unproductive land that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall reduce by 20 percent the current use value of land which is open 12 months a year to public recreational use, without entrance fee, and which also qualifies for current use assessment under an open space category.  There shall be no prohibition of skiing, snowshoeing, fishing, hunting, hiking or nature observation on such open space land, unless these activities would be detrimental to a specific agricultural or forest crop or activity.  The owner of land who opens his land to public recreational use as provided in this paragraph shall not be liable for personal injury or property damage to any person, and shall be subject to the same duty of care as provided in RSA 212:34.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-A:5 Assessment of Open Space Land. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The selectmen or assessing officials shall appraise open space land, as classified under the provisions of this chapter, excluding any building, appurtenance or other improvement on the land, at valuations based upon the current use values established by the board.  The valuations shall be equalized for the purpose of assessing taxes.  The selectmen or assessing officials shall use the soil potential index when available, to determine the value of farm land within the ranges established by the board.  It shall be the duty of the owner to provide the soil potential index to the selectmen or assessing officials.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No owner of land shall be entitled to have a particular parcel of his land classified for any tax year under the provisions of this chapter unless he shall have applied to the assessing officials on or before April 15 of said year, on a form approved by the board and provided by the commissioner, to have his parcel of land so classified.  If any owner shall satisfy the assessing officials that he was prevented by accident, mistake or misfortune from filing said application on or before April 15, said officials may receive said application at a later date and classify the parcel of land hereunder;  but no such application shall be received after the local tax rate has been approved by the commissioner for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The assessing officials shall notify the applicant on a form provided by the commissioner no later than July 1, or within 15 days if the application is filed after July 1, of their decision to classify or refusal to classify his parcel of land by delivery of such notification to him in person or by mailing such notification to his last and usual place of abode.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Prior to July 1 each year, the assessing officials shall determine if previously classified lands have been reapplied or have undergone a change in use so that the land use change tax may be levied against lands changed in use, according to RSA 79-A:7.  A list of all classified lands and their owners in each town or city shall be filed by the respective assessing officials each year.  Such list shall be part of the invoice and subject to inspection as provided in RSA 76:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. The commissioner shall include on the inventory blank, required under RSA 74:4, a question concerning whether any changes have been made in the use of land classified as open space.  The question shall be written to enable the assessing officials to locate parcels which may require a change in assessment and to fit the context of the blank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The assessing officials shall file with the register of deeds in the appropriate county, on or before August 1 in each year, a notice of contingent liens describing all parcels of land classified under the provisions of this chapter.  If a parcel of land is classified as open space land after such date, the assessing officials shall file notice of contingent lien with the register of deeds in the appropriate county within 14 days of said classification.  The notice filed pursuant to this paragraph shall be on a form approved by the board and provided by the commissioner, shall contain the name of each owner, the date of classification and a short description of each parcel of real estate together with such other information as the board may prescribe;  provided, however, the assessing officials shall not file each year parcels of land classified under this chapter which have been previously filed, unless there has been some change in the acreage involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A fee, in accordance with RSA 478:17-g, I, shall be paid by the owner for each parcel which is classified as open space land to the local assessing officials, to be paid over to the register of deeds for recording the notice of contingent lien.  The notice of contingent lien shall constitute notice to all interested parties that a lien on the parcel shall be created if and when the land is subsequently disqualified from current use assessment, as provided in RSA 79-A:7, II(e) and RSA 80:85.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-A:7 Land Use Change Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Land which has been classified as open space land and assessed at current use values on or after April 1, 1974, pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to a land use change tax when it is changed to a use which does not qualify for current use assessment.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 75:1, the tax shall be at the rate of 10 percent of the full and true value determined without regard to the current use value of the land which is subject to a non-qualifying use or any equalized value factor used by the municipality or the county in the case of unincorporated towns or unorganized places in which the land is located.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 76:2, such assessed value shall be determined as of the actual date of the change in land use if such date is not April 1.  This tax shall be in addition to the annual real estate tax imposed upon the property, and shall be due and payable upon the change in land use.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require payment of an additional land use change tax when the use is changed from one non-qualifying use to another non-qualifying use.  The tax imposed by this section is a tax on the change of use of the land and not a tax on the land itself.  The property tax exemptions under RSA 72:23 shall not apply to the land use change tax and no person or entity shall be exempt from payment of the land use change tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Land which is classified as open space land and assessed at current use values shall be assessed at current use values until a change in land use occurs pursuant to RSA 79-A:7, IV, V, or VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The land use change tax shall be due and payable by the owner, or by the responsible party pursuant to RSA 79-A:7, VI(e), at the time of the change in use to the town or city in which the property is located.  If the property is located in an unincorporated town or unorganized place, the tax shall be due and payable by the owner or responsible party at the time of the change in use to the county in which the property is located.  Moneys paid to a county from the land use change tax shall be used, in addition to any other funds, to pay for the cost of the services provided in RSA 28:7-a and 7-b.  The land use change tax shall be due and payable according to the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner shall prescribe and issue forms to the local assessing officials for the land use change tax bill which shall provide a description of the property which is subject to a non-qualifying use, the RSA 75:1 full value assessment, and the tax payable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prescribed form shall be prepared in quadruplicate;  the original, duplicate, and triplicate copy of the form shall be given to the collector of taxes for collection of the land use change tax along with a special tax warrant authorizing the collector to collect the land use change tax assessed under the warrant;  the quadruplicate copy of the form shall be retained by the local assessing officials for their records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon receipt of the land use change tax warrant and the prescribed forms, the tax collector shall mail the duplicate copy of the tax bill to the owner responsible for the tax as the notice thereof.  Such bill shall be mailed, at the latest, within 18 months of the date upon which the local assessing officials receive written notice of the change of use from the landowner or his or her agent, or within 18 months of the date the local assessing officials actually discover that the land use change tax is due and payable.  Upon receipt of payment, but except for proceedings under RSA 79-A:7, VI(e), the collector shall forward the original tax bill to the register of deeds of the county in which the land is located for the purpose of releasing recorded contingent liens required under RSA 79-A:5, VI.  The tax bill shall state clearly whether all, or only a portion, of the land affected by the notice of contingent lien is subject to release.  The recording fee charged by the register of deeds shall be paid by the owner of the land in accordance with the fees to which the register of deeds is entitled under RSA 478:17-g, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Payment of the land use change tax, together with the recording fees due the register of deeds, shall be due not later than 30 days after mailing of the tax bills for such tax, and interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum shall be due thereafter on any taxes not paid within the 30-day period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) All land use change tax assessments levied under this section shall, on the date of the change in use, create a lien upon the lands on account of which they are made and against the owner of record of such land or against the responsible party pursuant to RSA 79-A:7, VI(e).  Furthermore, such liens shall continue for a period of 24 months following the date upon which the local assessing officials receive written notice of the change of use from the landowner or his agent, or the date the local assessing officials actually discover that the land use change tax is due and payable, and such assessment shall be subject to statutory collection proceedings against real estate as prescribed by RSA 80.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Thereafter, the land which has changed to a use which does not qualify for current use assessment shall be taxed at its full RSA 75:1 value.  The land shall again become eligible for current use assessment if it meets the open space criteria established by the board under RSA 79-A:4, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever land of nonuniform value shall be subject to the land use change tax under this section, or whenever the full value assessment for the land subject to the tax shall not be readily available then the local assessing officials shall assess the RSA 75:1 full value of such land and the land use change tax shall be paid upon such assessed value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For purposes of this section land use shall be considered changed and the land use change tax shall become payable when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Actual construction begins on the site causing physical changes in the earth, such as building a road to serve existing or planned residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional buildings;  or installation of sewer, water, electrical or other utilities or services to serve existing or planned residential, commercial, industrial, institutional or commercial buildings;  or excavating or grading the site for present or future construction of buildings;  or any other act consistent with the construction of buildings on the site;  except that roads for agricultural, recreational, watershed or forestry purposes are exempt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Topsoil, gravel or minerals are excavated or dug from the site;  except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Removal of topsoil in the process of harvesting a sod farm crop in amounts which will not deplete the topsoil;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Removal of gravel and other materials for construction and maintenance of roads and lands for agricultural and forestry purposes within the qualifying property of the owner or, with the approval of local authorities, to other qualifying property of the owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Sale of excavated materials shall constitute a land use change of the property from which the material was excavated.  The site shall be reclaimed when the construction or maintenance project is completed to mitigate environmental and aesthetic effects of the excavation.  Both project completion time and acceptability of reclamation shall be determined by local authorities.  The owner shall keep local officials informed in writing of plans to remove and use of soil material from qualifying lands for purposes of this subparagraph and to assure conformance with any local ordinances, as well as plans for reclamation of the site.  Fully reclaimed land shall be eligible for current use assessment if it meets open space criteria established by the board under RSA 79-A:4, I, whether or not such land was under current use assessment prior to the excavation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) By reason of size, the site no longer conforms to criteria established by the board under RSA 79-A:4, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The amount of land which has changed to a use which does not qualify for current use assessment and on which the land use change tax shall be assessed in the circumstances delineated in RSA 79-A:7, IV shall be according to rules adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A by the chairman of the board, based upon the recommendation of the board.  Except in the case of land which has changed to a use which does not qualify for current use assessment due to size, only the number of acres on which an actual physical change has taken place shall become subject to the land use change tax, and land not physically changed shall remain under current use assessment, except as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) When a road is constructed or other utilities installed pursuant to a development plan which has received all necessary local, state or federal approvals, all lots or building sites, including roads and utilities, shown on the plan and served by such road or utilities shall be considered changed in use, with the exception of any lot or site, or combination of adjacent lots or sites shown thereon which are under the same ownership, and large enough to remain qualified for current use assessment;  provided, however, that if any physical changes are made to the land prior to the issuance of any required local, state or federal permit or approval, or if such changes otherwise violate any local, state or federal law, ordinance or rule, the local assessing officials may delay the assessment of the land use change tax until any and all required permits or approvals have been secured, or illegal actions remedied, and may base the land use change tax assessed under RSA 79-A:7 upon the land's full and true value at that later time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When land is required to remain undeveloped to satisfy density, setback, or other local, state, or federal requirements as part of the approval of a plan of a contiguous development area, such land shall be considered changed to a use which does not qualify for current use assessment at the time any portion of such development area is physically changed to a non-qualifying use.  However, application of the land use change tax to such development area shall continue to be in accordance with subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When a road is constructed or utilities installed pursuant to a condominium development plan, only the development area shall be removed from current use along with the percentage interest in the open space land assigned to the unit or units within that development area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For purposes of this section, land use shall not be considered changed and the land use change tax shall not be assessed when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Land under current use is taken by eminent domain or any other type of governmental taking which would cause the use change penalty to be invoked because, by reason of an actual physical change or by reason of size, the site no longer conforms to criteria established by the board under RSA 79-A:4, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Land abutting a site taken by eminent domain or any other governmental taking upon which construction is in progress is used to stockpile earth taken from the construction site.  Stockpiled earth may be removed at a later date after written notification to the appropriate local official.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Land accorded current use assessment in one category is changed in use to any other qualifying category.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Land under current use assessment is eligible for conservation restriction assessment pursuant to RSA 79-B.  Such land shall then be allowed to change from current use assessment to conservation restriction assessment with no land use change tax being applied.
<br>

(e) A road is constructed on an existing right-of-way on current use land solely for the purpose of access to an adjoining lot where the owner of the land in current use does no other activity changing the use of the land under this section and does not share any ownership interest in the adjoining lot.  Provided, however, and notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, that if such road construction on an existing right-of-way would constitute a change in use if done by the owner of the land in current use, then the owner of such adjoining property utilizing the road for access shall be responsible for and shall be assessed the land use change tax penalty on such land as provided for in this section, although such land in current use shall remain in current use.  Enforcement and collection proceedings shall be applied to the party responsible for the payment of the penalty under this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. When land which is accorded current use assessment in one category is changed in use to any other qualifying category as provided in subparagraph VI(c), the owner of the land shall notify the local assessing officials in writing of the change in use at the time that the change in use is made.  If a land owner fails to provide the notice required under this paragraph, he may be fined not more than $50 at the discretion of the town or city.

After a vote pursuant to RSA 79-A:25-b, no land use change tax revenue collected under this chapter shall be recognized as general fund revenue for the fiscal year in which it is received, except to the extent that such revenue is appropriated pursuant to paragraph II of this section.

II. After any transfer to the conservation fund required under the provisions of RSA 79-A:25, II, the surplus remaining in the land use change tax fund shall not be deemed part of the general fund nor shall any surplus be expended for any purpose or transferred to any appropriation until such time as the legislative body shall have had the opportunity at an annual meeting to appropriate a specific amount from said fund for any purpose not prohibited by the laws or by the constitution of this state.  At the end of an annual meeting, any unappropriated balance of land use change tax revenue received during the prior fiscal year shall be recognized as general fund revenue for the current fiscal year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-A:25-b Procedure for Adoption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any town may adopt the provisions of RSA 79-A:25-a to account for all revenues received pursuant to this chapter in a land use change tax fund separate from the general fund in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In a town, the question shall be placed on the warrant of a special or annual town meeting by the selectmen, or by petition under RSA 39:3, and shall be voted on by ballot.  The question shall not be placed on the official ballot.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The selectmen shall hold a public hearing on the question at least 15 days but not more than 30 days before the question is to be voted on.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the municipality and published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 7 days before the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall we adopt the provisions of RSA 79-A:25-a to account for revenues received from the land use change tax in a fund separate from the general fund?  Any surplus remaining in the land use change tax fund shall not be part of the general fund until such time as the legislative body shall have had the opportunity at an annual meeting to vote to appropriate a specific amount from the land use change tax fund for any purpose not prohibited by the laws or by the constitution of this state.  After an annual meeting any unappropriated balance of the land use change tax revenue received during the prior fiscal year shall be recognized as general fund revenue for the current fiscal year.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes,'' RSA 79-A:25-a shall apply within the town, effective immediately.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the question is not approved, the question may later be voted on according to the provisions of RSA 79-A:25-b, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any town which has adopted the provisions of RSA 79-A:25-a shall maintain a land use change tax fund until such time as the legislative body votes to rescind its action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any town may consider rescinding its action in the manner prescribed in RSA 79-A:25-b, I(a) and (b).  The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall we rescind the provisions of RSA 79-A:25-a which account for revenues received from the land use change tax in a fund separate from the general fund?  Any unappropriated surplus remaining in the land use change tax fund, and any future land use change tax revenues received shall immediately be deemed general fund revenue.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes,'' RSA 79-A:25-a shall no longer apply within the town, effective immediately.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The legislative body of any city may adopt the provisions of RSA 79-A:25-a in the same manner in which it adopts ordinances or bylaws, and may rescind its action in like manner.
