<center><h3>Section 72-B:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72-B:8 Notice of Intent to Excavate. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every owner, as defined in RSA 72-B:2, VIII, who intends to excavate earth shall, at the beginning of each tax year and prior to excavating, file with the proper assessing officials in the city, town, or unincorporated place where such excavating is to take place a notice of intent to excavate as provided by the commissioner, stating the owner's name;  type of ownership;  residence;  telephone number;  tax map, block, and lot number;  the town, city, or unincorporated place where the excavating will take place;  an estimate of the volume of earth to be excavated;  an estimate of the type of earth to be excavated;  and such other information as may be necessary to locate, identify, verify, and determine the full extent of the excavation and extent of compliance with RSA 155-E and RSA 485-A:17.  A separate intent shall be filed for each separate tract of land as identified by the municipal tax maps.  If the excavation is located in more than one municipality, a separate intent to excavate shall be filed with each municipality.  A supplemental notice of intent to excavate shall be filed in the same manner stating any additional volume of earth to be excavated in excess of the original estimate within the same tax year.  The assessing officials shall, within 30 days of signing a notice of intent to excavate, notify the tax collector that an intent to excavate has been filed.  The assessing officials may decline to sign an intent to excavate for noncompliance by the owner with applicable requirements of RSA 72-B:5 relative to bonding, RSA 155-E relative to local regulation excavations, RSA 485-A:17 relative to terrain alterations or RSA 79-A, relative to current use.  The notice of intent to excavate shall serve as notice that the land is subject to a tax lien pursuant to RSA 72-B:7.  The appropriate copies of all intents to excavate received by a city, town, or unincorporated place shall within 30 days be assigned a number in accordance with the guidelines provided by the commissioner, then forwarded to the commissioner by the assessing officials.  Upon receipt of an original intent to excavate, the commissioner shall furnish to the owner a certificate to excavate and report of excavated material form.  Each certificate shall be posted by the owner filing such intent to excavate in a conspicuous place within the area of excavating.  Excavating before the appropriate notice of intent to excavate has been filed with the city, town, or unincorporated place and signed by the appropriate municipal officials shall constitute a violation by the owner or any other person doing the excavation, or both.  Failure to post the certificate on the job in a conspicuous place upon receipt shall constitute a violation, and failure of the assessing officials to forward the appropriate copies of the intent to excavate to the department within 30 days after receipt shall constitute a violation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72-B:8-a Supplemental Notice of Intent to Excavate. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every owner who has filed a notice of intent to excavate under RSA 72-B:8 shall file a supplemental notice of intent to excavate for the amount of earth which exceeds the original amount of earth estimated.  If the owner originally stated an estimate of 1,000 yards or less and was exempted from the $100 enforcement fee, the owner shall provide the $100 enforcement fee with the supplemental intent to excavate.  If the owner paid the $100 enforcement fee with the original intent to excavate, no additional fee is required for the supplemental intent.  Failure to file a supplemental intent and failure to provide the required enforcement fee shall constitute a violation by the owner or any other person doing the excavation, or both.

Every owner who has filed a notice of intent to excavate as provided in RSA 72-B:8 shall sign under the penalties of perjury and file with the assessing officials a report of all excavated material for each intent to excavate filed.  The report shall be upon a form provided by the commissioner, with 2 copies to be sent to the commissioner.  If no earth was excavated during the tax year, then the report of excavated material shall be returned stating so.  If excavating is completed during the tax year, the owner shall file the report of excavated material no later than 30 days following the completion of the excavating.  The assessing officials shall make an assessment of the excavation tax within 30 days after receipt of the report of excavated material form.  The report of excavated material form shall contain the owner's name, telephone number, residence, tax map, block, and lot number, the town, city, or unincorporated place where the excavation occurred, the volume and type of earth in cubic yards, and such other information as may be necessary to locate, identify, verify, and determine the full extent of excavation, reclamation, and extent of compliance with either RSA 155-E or RSA 485-A:17, for which each report is filed.  The report of excavated material form pertaining to excavating still in progress through March 31 of any year shall be filed no later than the following April 15 for all earth excavated during the tax year up to and including March 31.  The report shall be accompanied by an estimate of the size of the excavation area as it existed at the end of the tax year, or in the alternative, a statement that the size of the excavation area has not changed since the prior tax year.  A person who fails to file a report of excavated material with the proper assessing officials or to send copies of the report as required in this section to the commissioner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  Any owner who falsifies a report of excavated material form shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Such doomage shall be collected by the tax collector in the usual manner and paid over to the town or city treasurer for use of the town or city, or, in the case of an unincorporated place, shall be collected by the county commissioners and paid over to the county treasurer for use of the county.
