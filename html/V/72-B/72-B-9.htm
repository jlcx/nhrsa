&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72-B:9 Report of Excavated Material. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every owner who has filed a notice of intent to excavate as provided in RSA 72-B:8 shall sign under the penalties of perjury and file with the assessing officials a report of all excavated material for each intent to excavate filed.  The report shall be upon a form provided by the commissioner, with 2 copies to be sent to the commissioner.  If no earth was excavated during the tax year, then the report of excavated material shall be returned stating so.  If excavating is completed during the tax year, the owner shall file the report of excavated material no later than 30 days following the completion of the excavating.  The assessing officials shall make an assessment of the excavation tax within 30 days after receipt of the report of excavated material form.  The report of excavated material form shall contain the owner's name, telephone number, residence, tax map, block, and lot number, the town, city, or unincorporated place where the excavation occurred, the volume and type of earth in cubic yards, and such other information as may be necessary to locate, identify, verify, and determine the full extent of excavation, reclamation, and extent of compliance with either RSA 155-E or RSA 485-A:17, for which each report is filed.  The report of excavated material form pertaining to excavating still in progress through March 31 of any year shall be filed no later than the following April 15 for all earth excavated during the tax year up to and including March 31.  The report shall be accompanied by an estimate of the size of the excavation area as it existed at the end of the tax year, or in the alternative, a statement that the size of the excavation area has not changed since the prior tax year.  A person who fails to file a report of excavated material with the proper assessing officials or to send copies of the report as required in this section to the commissioner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  Any owner who falsifies a report of excavated material form shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
