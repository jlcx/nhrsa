<center><h3>Section 79-F:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-F:1 Declaration of Public Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court hereby finds it to be in the public interest to encourage the preservation of productive farms and associated structures.  These structures are important in sustaining the economic viability of the state's farms, ensuring a reliable and safe local food supply, and providing an attractive environment for recreation, tourism, and wildlife.  Farming in New Hampshire has a long and proud history which shaped our state's landscape.  It is further declared to be in the public interest to prevent the loss of farms and their associated structures due to property taxation at values incompatible with their usage.

<center><h3>Section 79-F:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-F:4 Appraisal of Qualifying Farm Structures and Land Under Them. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The selectmen or assessing officials in any municipality adopting the provisions of this chapter shall appraise:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Qualifying farm structures for no more than their replacement costs less depreciation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The land under the qualifying farm structures at no more than 10 percent of its market value.  The land under the qualifying farm structure shall be contiguous to a minimum of 10 acres of open space land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No owner of a qualifying structure shall be entitled to have the qualifying structure or land under it classified for any tax year under the provisions of this chapter unless he or she applies to the assessing officials on or before April 15 of said year, on a form approved and provided by the commissioner, to have his or her parcel of land so classified.  If any owner satisfies the assessing officials that he or she was prevented by accident, mistake, or misfortune from filing such application on or before April 15, the assessing officials may receive the application at a later date and classify the structure and parcel of land under this chapter;  but no such application shall be received after the local tax rate has been approved by the commissioner for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The assessing officials shall notify the applicant on a form provided by the commissioner no later than July 1, or within 15 days if the application is filed after July 1, of their decision to classify or refusal to classify the structure and parcel of land under the provisions of this chapter by delivery of such notification to him or her in person or by mailing such notification to his or her last and usual place of abode.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Prior to July 1 each year, the assessing officials shall determine if previously classified structures and lands have been reapplied or have undergone a change in use so that the use change tax may be levied against the structures and lands changed in use, according to RSA 79-F:5.  A list of all classified structures and lands and their owners in each town or city shall be filed by the respective assessing officials each year.  Such list shall be part of the invoice and subject to inspection as provided in RSA 76:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner shall include on the inventory blank, required under RSA 74:4, a question concerning whether any changes have been made in the use of qualifying structures and land classified as land under qualifying farm structures.  The question shall be written to enable the assessing officials to locate structures and parcels which may require a change in assessment and to fit the context of the blank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The assessing officials shall file with the register of deeds in the appropriate county, on or before August 1 in each year, a notice of contingent liens describing all structures and parcels of land classified under the provisions of this chapter.  If a parcel of land is classified as land under qualifying farm structures after such date, the assessing officials shall file notice of contingent lien with the register of deeds in the appropriate county within 14 days of said classification.  The notice filed pursuant to this paragraph shall be on a form provided by the commissioner, shall contain the name of each owner, the date of classification, and a short description of each parcel of real estate together with such other information as the board may prescribe;  provided, however, the assessing officials shall not file each year parcels of land classified under this chapter which have been previously filed, unless there has been some change in the acreage involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A fee, in accordance with RSA 478:17-g, I, shall be paid by the owner for each parcel which is classified as land under qualifying farm structures to the local assessing officials, to be paid over to the register of deeds for recording the notice of contingent lien.  The notice of contingent lien shall constitute notice to all interested parties that a lien on the parcel shall be created if and when the land is subsequently disqualified from taxation under this chapter, in the same manner as provided in RSA 80:85.

<center><h3>Section 79-F:5</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-F:5 Consideration for Use Change. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Land and qualifying farm structures which have been appraised pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to a use change tax, payable to the tax collector of the municipality, if the use thereof changes to such an extent that the structure no longer meets the definition of a qualifying farm structure as defined in RSA 79-F:3, IX.  The consideration shall be at the rate of 10 percent of the full value assessment determined without regard to the current use of the land or qualifying farm structure.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 76:2, such assessed value shall be determined as of the actual date of the use change if such date is not April.  This use change tax shall be in addition to the annual real estate tax imposed upon the property, and shall be due and payable upon the use change.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon receipt of an application under the provisions of paragraph I, the board of tax and land appeals shall give notice in writing to the affected town or city of the receipt of the application by mailing such notice to the town or city clerk thereof by certified mail.  Such town or city may request in writing a hearing on such application within 30 days after the mailing of such notice.  If a hearing is requested by a town or city, the board shall, not less than 30 days prior to the date of hearing upon such application, give notice of the time and place of such hearing to the applicant and the town or city in writing.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the rights of taxpayers to a hearing before the board of tax and land appeals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

For the purposes of such appeal, the findings of fact by said board shall be final.  Any such appeal shall be limited to questions of law.  An election by an applicant to appeal in accordance with this paragraph shall be deemed a waiver of any right to petition the superior court in accordance with RSA 79-F:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A copy of an order of classification ordered by the board of tax and land appeals, attested as such by the chairman of the board, if no appeal is taken hereunder, may be filed in the superior court for the county or in the Merrimack county superior court at the option of said board;  and, thereafter, such order may be enforced as a final judgment of the superior court.
