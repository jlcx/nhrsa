&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-F:5 Consideration for Use Change. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Land and qualifying farm structures which have been appraised pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to a use change tax, payable to the tax collector of the municipality, if the use thereof changes to such an extent that the structure no longer meets the definition of a qualifying farm structure as defined in RSA 79-F:3, IX.  The consideration shall be at the rate of 10 percent of the full value assessment determined without regard to the current use of the land or qualifying farm structure.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 76:2, such assessed value shall be determined as of the actual date of the use change if such date is not April.  This use change tax shall be in addition to the annual real estate tax imposed upon the property, and shall be due and payable upon the use change.
