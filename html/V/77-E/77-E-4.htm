<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The portion of the base from interest shall be apportioned by multiplying the percentage of value of the total real and tangible personal property owned and employed by the business enterprise everywhere as is owned and employed by it in business activities in this state.  Property owned by the business enterprise shall be valued at its original cost.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

If the method of apportionment in paragraph I does not fairly represent the business enterprise's business activity in this state, the business enterprise may petition for, or the commissioner may require, in respect to all or any part of the business enterprise's business activity, if reasonable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The exclusion of any one or more of the apportionment factors;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The inclusion of one or more additional apportionment factors which will fairly represent the business enterprise's business activity in the state;  or
