&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 77-E:7 Additional Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the commissioner has reason to believe that a business enterprise failed to file a return or to include any part of its enterprise value tax base in a filed return, the commissioner may require the enterprise to file a return or a supplementary return showing such additional information as the commissioner prescribes.  Upon the receipt of the supplementary return, or if none is received within the time set by the commissioner, the commissioner may find and assess the amount due upon the information that is available.  The making of such additional return does not relieve the business enterprise of any penalty for failure to make a correct original return or relieve it from liability for interest imposed under RSA 21-J:28 or any other additional charges imposed by the commissioner.
