&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An owner of a qualifying structure who intends to substantially rehabilitate or replace such structure may apply to the governing body of the municipality in which the property is located for tax relief.  The applicant shall include the address of the property, a description of the intended rehabilitation or replacement, any changes in use of the property resulting from the rehabilitation or replacement, and an application fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. In order to assist the governing body with the review and evaluation of an application for replacement of a qualifying structure, an owner shall submit to the governing body as part of the application, a New Hampshire division of historical resources individual resource inventory form, prepared by a qualified architectural historian and a letter issued by the local heritage commission and if the qualifying structure is located within a designated historic district established in accordance with RSA 674:46, a letter from the historic district commission or, if such local commissions are not established, a letter issued by the New Hampshire division of historical resources that identifies any and all historical, cultural, and architectural value of the structure or structures that are proposed to be replaced and the property on which those structures are located.  The application for tax relief shall not be deemed to be complete and the governing body shall not schedule the public hearing on the application for replacement of a qualifying structure as required under RSA 79-E:4, II until the inventory form and the letter, as well as all other required information, have been submitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of an application, the governing body shall hold a duly noticed public hearing to take place no later than 60 days from receipt of the application, to determine whether the structure at issue is a qualifying structure;  whether any proposed rehabilitation qualifies as substantial rehabilitation;  and whether there is a public benefit to granting the requested tax relief and, if so, for what duration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No later than 45 days after the public hearing, the governing body shall render a decision granting or denying the requested tax relief and, if so granting, establishing the tax relief period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The governing body may grant the tax relief, provided:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The governing body finds a public benefit under RSA 79-E:7;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The specific public benefit is preserved through a covenant under RSA 79-E:8;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The governing body finds that the proposed use is consistent with the municipality's master plan or development regulations;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In the case of a replacement, the governing body specifically finds that the local heritage commission or historic district commission or, if such local commissions are not established, the New Hampshire division of historical resources has determined that the replaced qualifying structure does not possess significant historical, cultural, or architectural value, the replacement of the qualifying structure will achieve one or more of the public benefits identified in RSA 79-E:7 to a greater degree than the renovation of the underutilized structure, and the historical, cultural, or architectural resources in the community will not be adversely affected by the replacement.  In connection with these findings, the governing body may request that the division of historical resources conduct a technical evaluation in order to satisfy the governing body that historical resources will not be adversely affected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the governing body grants the tax relief, the governing body shall identify the specific public benefit achieved under RSA 79-E:7, and shall determine the precise terms and duration of the covenant to preserve the public benefit under RSA 79-E:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the governing body, in its discretion, denies the application for tax relief, such denial shall be accompanied by a written explanation.  The governing body's decision may be appealed either to the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court in the same manner as provided for appeals of current use classification pursuant to RSA 79-A:9 or 79-A:11 provided, however, that such denial shall be deemed discretionary and shall not be set aside by the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court except for bad faith or discrimination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Municipalities shall have no obligation to grant an application for tax relief for properties located within tax increment finance districts when the governing body determines, in its sole discretion, that the granting of tax relief will impede, reduce, or negatively affect:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The development program or financing plans for such tax increment finance districts;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The ability to satisfy or expedite repayment of debt service obligations incurred for a tax increment financing district;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The ability to satisfy program administration, operating, or maintenance expenses within a tax increment financing district.
