&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-E:1 Declaration of Public Benefit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is declared to be a public benefit to enhance downtowns and town centers with respect to economic activity, cultural and historic character, sense of community, and in-town residential uses that contribute to economic and social vitality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is further declared to be a public benefit to encourage the rehabilitation of the many underutilized structures in urban and town centers as a means of encouraging growth of economic, residential, and municipal uses in a more compact pattern, in accordance with RSA 9-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. In instances where a qualifying structure is determined to possess no significant historical, cultural, or architectural value and for which the governing body makes a specific finding that rehabilitation would not achieve one or more of the public benefits established in RSA 79-E:7 to the same degree as the replacement of the underutilized structure with a new structure, the tax relief incentives provided under this chapter may be extended to the replacement of an underutilized structure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-b. It is further declared to be a public benefit to encourage the rehabilitation of historic structures in a municipality by increasing energy efficiency in the preservation and reuse of existing building stock.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Short-term property assessment tax relief and a related covenant to protect public benefit as provided under this chapter are considered to provide a demonstrated public benefit if they encourage substantial rehabilitation and use of qualifying structures, or in certain cases, the replacement of a qualifying structure, as defined in this chapter.

<codesect>
In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Historic structure'' means a building that is listed on or determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or the state register of historic places.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Qualifying structure'' means a building located in a district officially designated in a municipality's master plan, or by zoning ordinance, as a downtown, town center, central business district, or village center, or, where no such designation has been made, in a geographic area which, as a result of its compact development patterns and uses, is identified by the governing body as the downtown, town center, or village center for purposes of this chapter. Qualifying structure shall also mean historic structures in a municipality whose preservation and reuse would conserve the embodied energy in existing building stock.  Cities or towns may further limit "qualifying structure'' according to the procedure in RSA 79-E:3 as meaning only a structure located within such districts that meet certain age, occupancy, condition, size, or other similar criteria consistent with local economic conditions, community character, and local planning and development goals.  Cities or towns may further modify "qualifying structure'' to include buildings that have been destroyed by fire or act of nature, including where such destruction occurred within 15 years prior to the adoption of the provisions of this chapter by the city or town.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Replacement'' means the demolition or removal of a qualifying structure and the construction of a new structure on the same lot.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Substantial rehabilitation'' means rehabilitation of a qualifying structure which costs at least 15 percent of the pre-rehabilitation assessed valuation or at least $75,000, whichever is less.  In addition, in the case of historic structures, substantial rehabilitation means devoting a portion of the total cost, in the amount of at least 10 percent of the pre-rehabilitation assessed valuation or at least $5,000, whichever is less, to energy efficiency in accordance with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.  Cities or towns may further limit "substantial rehabilitation'' according to the procedure in RSA 79-E:3 as meaning rehabilitation which costs a percentage greater than 15 percent of pre-rehabilitation assessed valuation or an amount greater than $75,000 based on local economic conditions, community character, and local planning and development goals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Tax increment finance district'' means any district established in accordance with the provisions of RSA 162-K.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Tax relief'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For a qualifying structure, that for a period of time determined by a local governing body in accordance with this chapter, the property tax on a qualifying structure shall not increase as a result of the substantial rehabilitation thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the replacement of a qualifying structure, that for a period of time determined by a local governing body in accordance with this chapter, the property tax on a replacement structure shall not exceed the property tax on the replaced qualifying structure as a result of the replacement thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For a qualifying structure which is a building destroyed by fire or act of nature, that for a period of time determined by a local governing body in accordance with this chapter, the property tax on such qualifying structure shall not exceed the tax on the assessed value of the structure that would have existed had the structure not been destroyed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Tax relief period'' means the finite period of time during which the tax relief will be effective, as determined by a local governing body pursuant to RSA 79-E:5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-E:3 Adoption of Community Revitalization Tax Relief Incentive Program &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any city or town may adopt or modify the provisions of this chapter by voting whether to accept for consideration or modify requirements for requests for community revitalization tax relief incentives.  Any city or town may do so by following the procedures in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In a town, other than a town that has adopted a charter pursuant to RSA 49-D, the question shall be placed on the warrant of a special or annual town meeting, by the governing body or by petition under RSA 39:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In a city or town that has adopted a charter under RSA 49-C or RSA 49-D, the legislative body may consider and act upon the question in accordance with its normal procedures for passage of resolutions, ordinances, and other legislation.  In the alternative, the legislative body of such municipality may vote to place the question on the official ballot for any regular municipal election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a majority of those voting on the question vote "yes,'' applications for community revitalization tax relief incentives may be accepted and considered by the local governing body at any time thereafter, subject to the provisions of paragraph VI of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the question is not approved, the question may later be voted on according to the provisions of paragraph II or III of this section, whichever applies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The local governing body of any town or city that has adopted this program may consider rescinding its action in the manner described in paragraph II or III of this section, whichever applies.  A vote terminating the acceptance and consideration of such applications shall have no effect on incentives previously granted by the city or town, nor shall it terminate consideration of applications submitted prior to the date of such vote.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-E:4 Community Revitalization Tax Relief Incentive. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An owner of a qualifying structure who intends to substantially rehabilitate or replace such structure may apply to the governing body of the municipality in which the property is located for tax relief.  The applicant shall include the address of the property, a description of the intended rehabilitation or replacement, any changes in use of the property resulting from the rehabilitation or replacement, and an application fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. In order to assist the governing body with the review and evaluation of an application for replacement of a qualifying structure, an owner shall submit to the governing body as part of the application, a New Hampshire division of historical resources individual resource inventory form, prepared by a qualified architectural historian and a letter issued by the local heritage commission and if the qualifying structure is located within a designated historic district established in accordance with RSA 674:46, a letter from the historic district commission or, if such local commissions are not established, a letter issued by the New Hampshire division of historical resources that identifies any and all historical, cultural, and architectural value of the structure or structures that are proposed to be replaced and the property on which those structures are located.  The application for tax relief shall not be deemed to be complete and the governing body shall not schedule the public hearing on the application for replacement of a qualifying structure as required under RSA 79-E:4, II until the inventory form and the letter, as well as all other required information, have been submitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of an application, the governing body shall hold a duly noticed public hearing to take place no later than 60 days from receipt of the application, to determine whether the structure at issue is a qualifying structure;  whether any proposed rehabilitation qualifies as substantial rehabilitation;  and whether there is a public benefit to granting the requested tax relief and, if so, for what duration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No later than 45 days after the public hearing, the governing body shall render a decision granting or denying the requested tax relief and, if so granting, establishing the tax relief period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The governing body may grant the tax relief, provided:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The governing body finds a public benefit under RSA 79-E:7;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The specific public benefit is preserved through a covenant under RSA 79-E:8;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The governing body finds that the proposed use is consistent with the municipality's master plan or development regulations;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In the case of a replacement, the governing body specifically finds that the local heritage commission or historic district commission or, if such local commissions are not established, the New Hampshire division of historical resources has determined that the replaced qualifying structure does not possess significant historical, cultural, or architectural value, the replacement of the qualifying structure will achieve one or more of the public benefits identified in RSA 79-E:7 to a greater degree than the renovation of the underutilized structure, and the historical, cultural, or architectural resources in the community will not be adversely affected by the replacement.  In connection with these findings, the governing body may request that the division of historical resources conduct a technical evaluation in order to satisfy the governing body that historical resources will not be adversely affected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the governing body grants the tax relief, the governing body shall identify the specific public benefit achieved under RSA 79-E:7, and shall determine the precise terms and duration of the covenant to preserve the public benefit under RSA 79-E:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the governing body, in its discretion, denies the application for tax relief, such denial shall be accompanied by a written explanation.  The governing body's decision may be appealed either to the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court in the same manner as provided for appeals of current use classification pursuant to RSA 79-A:9 or 79-A:11 provided, however, that such denial shall be deemed discretionary and shall not be set aside by the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court except for bad faith or discrimination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Municipalities shall have no obligation to grant an application for tax relief for properties located within tax increment finance districts when the governing body determines, in its sole discretion, that the granting of tax relief will impede, reduce, or negatively affect:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The development program or financing plans for such tax increment finance districts;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The ability to satisfy or expedite repayment of debt service obligations incurred for a tax increment financing district;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The ability to satisfy program administration, operating, or maintenance expenses within a tax increment financing district.

The governing body may, in its discretion, extend such additional years of tax relief as provided for under this section, provided that no such additional years of tax relief may be provided prior to the completion of construction of the replacement structure.  The municipal tax assessment of the replacement structure and the property on which it is located shall not increase or decrease in the period between the approval by the governing body of tax relief for the replacement structure and the time the owner completes construction of the replacement structure and grants to the municipality the covenant to protect the public benefit as required by this chapter.  The governing body may not grant any tax assessment relief under this chapter with respect to property and structures for which an election has been made for property appraisal under RSA 75:1-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The governing body may, in its discretion, add up to an additional 2 years of tax relief for a project that results in new residential units and up to 4 years for a project that includes affordable housing.

The governing body may, in its discretion, add up to an additional 4 years of tax relief for the substantial rehabilitation of a qualifying structure that is listed on or determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, state register of historic places, or is located within and important to a locally designated historic district, provided that the substantial rehabilitation is conducted in accordance with the U.S. Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The governing body may adopt local guidelines to assist it in determining the appropriate duration of the tax assessment relief period.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Tax relief for the substantial rehabilitation or replacement of a qualifying structure shall be effective only after a property owner grants to the municipality a covenant ensuring that the structure shall be maintained and used in a manner that furthers the public benefits for which the tax relief was granted and as otherwise provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The covenant shall be coextensive with the tax relief period.  The covenant may, if required by the governing body, be effective for a period of time up to twice the duration of the tax relief period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The covenant shall include provisions requiring the property owner to obtain casualty insurance, and flood insurance if appropriate.  The covenant may include, at the governing body's sole discretion, a lien against proceeds from casualty and flood insurance claims for the purpose of ensuring proper restoration or demolition or damaged structures and property.  If the property owner has not begun the process of restoration, rebuilding, or demolition of such structure within one year following damage or destruction, the property owner shall be subject to the termination of provisions set forth in RSA 79-E:9, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The local governing body shall provide for the recording of the covenant to protect public benefit with the registry of deeds.  It shall be a burden upon the property and shall bind all transferees and assignees of such property.

I. If the owner fails to maintain or utilize the building according to the terms of the covenant, or fails to restore, rebuild, or demolish the structure following damage or destruction as provided in RSA 79-E:8, III, the governing body shall, after a duly noticed public hearing, determine whether and to what extent the public benefit of the rehabilitation or replacement has been diminished and shall determine whether to terminate or reduce the tax relief period in accordance with such determination.  If the covenant is terminated, the governing body shall assess all taxes to the owner as though no tax relief was granted, with interest in accordance with paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any tax payment required under paragraph I shall be payable according to the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
