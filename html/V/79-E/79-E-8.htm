&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-E:8 Covenant to Protect Public Benefit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Tax relief for the substantial rehabilitation or replacement of a qualifying structure shall be effective only after a property owner grants to the municipality a covenant ensuring that the structure shall be maintained and used in a manner that furthers the public benefits for which the tax relief was granted and as otherwise provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The covenant shall be coextensive with the tax relief period.  The covenant may, if required by the governing body, be effective for a period of time up to twice the duration of the tax relief period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The covenant shall include provisions requiring the property owner to obtain casualty insurance, and flood insurance if appropriate.  The covenant may include, at the governing body's sole discretion, a lien against proceeds from casualty and flood insurance claims for the purpose of ensuring proper restoration or demolition or damaged structures and property.  If the property owner has not begun the process of restoration, rebuilding, or demolition of such structure within one year following damage or destruction, the property owner shall be subject to the termination of provisions set forth in RSA 79-E:9, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The local governing body shall provide for the recording of the covenant to protect public benefit with the registry of deeds.  It shall be a burden upon the property and shall bind all transferees and assignees of such property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The applicant shall pay any reasonable expenses incurred by the municipality in the drafting, review, and/or execution of the covenant.  The applicant also shall be responsible for the cost of recording the covenant.
