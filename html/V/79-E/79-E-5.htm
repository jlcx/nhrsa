For the approval of a replacement of a qualifying structure, the governing body may grant such tax assessment relief for a period of up to 5 years, beginning only upon the completion of construction of the replacement structure.

The municipal tax assessment of the replacement structure and the property on which it is located shall not increase or decrease in the period between the approval by the governing body of tax relief for the replacement structure and the time the owner completes construction of the replacement structure and grants to the municipality the covenant to protect the public benefit as required by this chapter.
