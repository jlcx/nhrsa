I. If the owner fails to maintain or utilize the building according to the terms of the covenant, or fails to restore, rebuild, or demolish the structure following damage or destruction as provided in RSA 79-E:8, III, the governing body shall, after a duly noticed public hearing, determine whether and to what extent the public benefit of the rehabilitation or replacement has been diminished and shall determine whether to terminate or reduce the tax relief period in accordance with such determination.  If the covenant is terminated, the governing body shall assess all taxes to the owner as though no tax relief was granted, with interest in accordance with paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any tax payment required under paragraph I shall be payable according to the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner of the department of revenue administration shall prescribe and issue forms to the local assessing officials for the payment due, which shall provide a description of the property, the market value assessment according to RSA 75:1, and the amount payable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prescribed form shall be prepared in quadruplicate.  The original, duplicate, and triplicate copy of the form shall be given to the collector of taxes for collection of the payment along with a special tax warrant authorizing the collector to collect the payment under the warrant.  The quadruplicate copy of the form shall be retained by the local assessing officials for their records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon receipt of the special tax warrant and prescribed forms, the tax collector shall mail the duplicate copy of the tax bill to the owner responsible for the tax as the notice of payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Payment shall be due not later than 30 days after the mailing of the bill.  Interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum shall be due thereafter on any amount not paid within the 30-day period.  Interest at 12 percent per annum shall be charged upon all taxes that would have been due and payable on or before December 1 of each tax year as if no tax relief had been granted.
