<codesect>
Whenever a person, firm or corporation enters into a contract or agreement with the state or any political subdivision thereof and such contractor has in his possession and uses any taxable property owned by another upon the job to be performed under the contract or agreement, it shall be a stated term or condition of such contract that the contractor having such property in his possession shall be liable for the amount of taxes assessed against such property in the name of the owner of such property while the same is in the possession of such contractor to the extent of the amount of any sum or sums of money that may be due from said contractor to the owner of such property for rental or hire thereof at the time of or after the collector of taxes has notified said contractor in writing that he has made demand upon the owner of such property for payment of the taxes assessed upon said property but that the owner of such property has failed, neglected or refused to pay said taxes.  Said contractor may retain from the sums to be paid for the use of such property the amount for which he is liable hereunder.  The amount of the taxes for which the said contractor may be liable hereunder may be withheld or retained from the contract price under the provisions of RSA 80:7.
