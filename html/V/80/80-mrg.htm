If on December 1 the person, firm or corporation is not entitled to sufficient sums under the contract from which the treasurer can withhold the amount of taxes due, the treasurer as soon thereafter as sufficient sums are available for the purpose shall immediately pay over to the collector the sums so withheld.  If the person, firm or corporation shall pay to the collector the taxes for which he or it is liable after notice to withhold by the collector to the treasurer, the collector shall immediately notify the treasurer so withholding, and the sum so withheld shall be paid to the person, firm or corporation, if otherwise due.

Whenever it shall appear to the selectmen or assessors that the collector of taxes, after having posted his notices of a tax sale, will be unable to conduct the same at the time and place specified in the notices thereof, they shall have the power to appoint one of their number to adjourn the sale for not exceeding 3 days as the collector could do, if present.  If the incapacitated collector has a deputy or deputies who have been duly appointed by him and bonded, then any such deputy shall have authority to postpone the sale in like manner.  If, at the end of the adjourned period, the tax collector is unable to officiate by reason of illness or other unavoidable cause, the selectmen or assessors may appoint in writing any duly qualified deputy tax collector to conduct the sale and make the statutory return to the register of deeds.  If there be no deputy collector qualified to act, the selectmen or assessors may appoint some suitable person to serve as tax sale agent.  Such appointee shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duty which shall be to conduct the sale, receive all money due from the purchasers at the tax sale and to deliver the same to the town or city treasurer, taking his receipt therefor, and to make report of the sale to the register of deeds within 15 days thereafter.  No bond shall be required of any person who may be appointed to act as tax sale agent.  For the proper discharge of his duties the agent shall be entitled to the fees and charges that the collector would have received if he had conducted said sale and made report thereof to the register of deeds.  If said sale is made in a municipality wherein all fees and costs accrue to the town or city, then the sum to be allowed to the tax sale agent for his services shall not be less than the per diem compensation of the tax collector, if he be paid upon a salary basis, nor less than he would have received if employed upon a commission basis.  Within 24 hours after a tax sale has been made by a deputy tax collector or a tax sale agent, the selectmen or assessors shall notify the commissioner of revenue administration in writing, of the time and place of said sale, the total amount paid by the town or city and by other purchasers, if any, and the name of the person conducting such sale.  An attested copy of their notice to the commissioner of revenue administration shall be delivered by the selectmen or assessors to the deputy collector or agent making such sale.  Such person shall thereupon forward said copy of notice, together with his report of the tax sale, to the register of deeds who shall cause the same to be entered as a part of the tax sale record.

Such notice shall give the date of the tax sale, the name of the delinquent taxpayer, the total amount for which said real estate was sold and the amount of costs for notifying mortgagees.  As provided in RSA 80:37, the tax collector shall send a similar notice to any mortgagee within 30 days of the time of payment of any subsequent tax thereon by the purchaser.  Any tax sale of such encumbered real estate shall be void as against any mortgagee and no tax collector's deed based on said sale shall be valid unless the mortgagees shall have been notified in the manner provided in RSA 80:29, but the tax and any subsequent tax payments made upon the property shall be collectible and payment may be enforced by suit under the provisions of RSA 80:50.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The collector, after 2 years from the sale, shall execute to the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, a deed of the land so sold and not redeemed.  The deed shall be substantially as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Know all men by these presents, That I, __________, collector of taxes for the Town of __________, in the County of __________, and State of New Hampshire, for the year 19 ___, by the authority in me vested by the laws of the state, and in consideration of __________ to me paid by __________, do hereby sell and convey to him the said __________, his heirs and assigns (here describe the land sold), to have and to hold the said premises with appurtenances to him, __________, his heirs and assigns forever.  And I do hereby covenant with said __________, that, in making this conveyance I have in all things complied with the law, and that I have a good right, so far as the right may depend upon the regularity of my own proceedings, to sell and convey the same in manner aforesaid.  In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal the __________ day of __________, __________.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of __________.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, the collector shall not execute a deed of the real estate where the purchaser is a municipality which has purchased the real estate at a tax sale for the payment of taxes, and the governing body of the municipality has notified the collector that it shall not accept the deed because acceptance would subject the municipality to potential liability as an owner of property under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. section 9601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. section 6901 et seq., RSA 147-A and 147-B, and any other federal or state environmental statute which imposes strict liability on owners for environmental impairment of the real estate involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. In addition to the circumstances described in paragraph II, the governing body of the municipality may refuse to accept a tax deed on behalf of the municipality, and shall so notify the collector, whenever in its judgment acceptance and ownership of the real estate would subject the municipality to undesirable obligations or liability risks, including obligations under real estate covenants or obligations to tenants, or for any other reason would be contrary to the public interest.  Such a decision shall not be made solely for the private benefit of a taxpayer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a governing body has, under paragraph II or II-a, served notice upon the collector it shall not accept the deed, the tax lien shall remain in effect indefinitely, retaining its priority over other liens.  The taxpayer's right of redemption as provided by RSA 80:32 shall likewise be extended indefinitely, with interest continuing to accrue as provided in that section.  The tax obligation may be enforced by the municipality by suit as provided under RSA 80:50, and through any remedy provided by law for the enforcement of other types of liens and attachments.  If at any time, in the judgment of the municipal governing body, the reasons for refusing the tax deed no longer apply, and the tax lien has not been satisfied, the governing body may instruct the collector to issue the tax deed, and the collector shall do so after giving the notices required by RSA 80:38-a and 80:38-b.

I. For purposes of this section, "subsequent tax'' shall mean any tax assessed upon the real estate subsequent to that for which it was liened by a municipality, a county or the state.  The municipality, county, or state as holder of the tax lien may pay to the collector any subsequent tax after the final installment of said tax for that year is delinquent, and the collector shall, within 30 days after such payment of subsequent tax, notify the register of deeds of the payment, giving the date and the amount of such payment and the name of the municipality, county, or state so paying, together with the date of the tax lien, the name of the person taxed, and a description of the property subject to tax lien as shown in the report recorded in the registry of deeds.  The collector of taxes shall receive $2 for such notice to the register of deeds of the subsequent payment plus $2 to be paid to the register of deeds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The municipality, county or state as holder of the tax lien, within 30 days of payment of the subsequent tax, shall notify the current owner, if known, or the person as shown in the report of tax lien by certified mail.  At the same time, the holder of the tax lien shall personally, or by certified mail, notify any mortgagee who was previously notified relative to the execution of the tax lien of his payment of the subsequent tax.  The lienholder paying the subsequent tax shall receive $10 for each notice to the current owner, if known, or the person as shown in the report of tax lien, together with expenses for sending the notice by certified mail, and a $10 fee for each notice sent or given to a mortgagee, together with expenses for sending the notice by certified mail.

III. When a municipality is the lienholder and the municipality pays a subsequent tax and the selectmen direct the collector of taxes, as agent of the municipality, to give such notice of said payment to any owner and to any mortgagee as provided above, the collector of taxes shall receive the same fees provided for the lienholder for his service.  The amount of subsequent taxes paid, together with interest on such taxes at the rate of 18 percent per annum from the date of payment shall, in addition to the tax lien amount at the time of execution with interest and costs, be paid by the person making redemption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 80:76 Tax Deed. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The collector, after 2 years from the execution of the real estate tax lien, shall execute to the lienholder a deed of the land subject to the real estate tax lien and not redeemed.  The deed shall be substantially as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Know all men by these presents, That I, __________, collector of taxes for the Town of __________, in the County of __________ and State of New Hampshire, for the year 19___, by the authority in me vested by the laws of the state, and in consideration of __________ to me paid by __________, do hereby sell and convey to __________, the said __________, (here describe the land sold), to have and to hold the said premises with the appurtenances to __________, forever.  And I do hereby covenant with said __________, that in making this conveyance I have in all things complied with the law, and that I have a good right, so far as the right may depend upon the regularity of my own proceedings, to sell and convey the same in manner aforesaid.  In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal the __________ day of __________, __________.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of __________.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, the collector shall not execute a deed of the real estate to a municipality when the governing body of the municipality has notified the collector that it shall not accept the deed because acceptance would subject the municipality to potential liability as an owner of property under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. section 9601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. section 6901 et seq., RSA 147-A and 147-B, and any other federal or state environmental statute which imposes strict liability on owners for environmental impairment of the real estate involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. In addition to the circumstances described in paragraph II, the governing body of the municipality may refuse to accept a tax deed on behalf of the municipality, and may so notify the collector, whenever in its judgment acceptance and ownership of the real estate would subject the municipality to undesirable obligations or liability risks, including obligations under real estate covenants or obligations to tenants, or for any other reason would be contrary to the public interest.  Such a decision shall not be made solely for the private benefit of a taxpayer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a governing body has, under paragraph II or II-a, served notice upon the collector it shall not accept the deed, the tax lien shall remain in effect indefinitely, retaining its priority over other liens.  The taxpayer's right of redemption as provided by RSA 80:69 shall likewise be extended indefinitely, with interest continuing to accrue as provided in that section.  The tax lien may be enforced by the municipality by suit as provided under RSA 80:50, and through any remedy provided by law for the enforcement of other types of liens and attachments.  If at any time, in the judgment of the municipal governing body, the reasons for refusing the tax deed no longer apply, and the tax lien has not been satisfied, the governing body may instruct the collector to issue the tax deed, and the collector shall do so after giving the notices required by RSA 80:77 and 80:77-a.

I. No transfer of any tax lien upon real estate acquired by a town or city as a result of the execution of the real estate tax lien by the tax collector for nonpayment of taxes thereon shall be made to any person by the municipality during the 2-year period allowed for redemption, nor shall title to any real estate taken by a town or city in default of redemption be conveyed to any person, unless the town, by majority vote at the annual meeting, or city council by vote, shall authorize the selectmen or the mayor to transfer such lien or to convey such property by deed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the selectmen or mayor are so authorized to convey such property by deed, either a public auction shall be held, or the property may be sold by advertised sealed bids.  The selectmen or mayor shall have the power to establish a minimum amount for which the property is to be sold and the terms and conditions of the sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. If the selectmen or mayor are authorized to transfer such liens during the 2-year redemption period, either a public auction shall be held, or the liens may be sold by advertised sealed bids.  The selectmen or mayor may establish minimum bids, and may set the terms and conditions of the sale.  Such liens may be sold singly or in combination, but no fractional interest in any lien shall be sold.  Such transfer shall not affect the right of the owner or others with a legal interest in the land to redeem the tax lien pursuant to RSA 80:69, or make partial payments in redemption pursuant to RSA 80:71, but the transferee shall become the lienholder for purposes of RSA 80:72 and 80:76.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The selectmen may, by a specific article in the town warrant, or the mayor, by ordinance, may be authorized to dispose of a lien or tax deeded property in a manner than otherwise provided in this section, as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Such authority to transfer or to sell shall continue in effect for one year from the date of the town meeting or action by the city or town council provided, however, that the authority to transfer tax liens, or to sell real estate acquired in default of redemption, or to vary the manner of such sale or transfer as justice may require, may be granted for an indefinite period, in which case the warrant article or vote granting such authority shall use the words "indefinitely, until rescinded'' or similar language.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Towns and cities may retain and hold for public uses real property the title to which has been acquired by them by tax collector's deed, upon vote of the town meeting or city council approving the same.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For purposes of this section, the authority to dispose of the property "as justice may require'' shall include the power of the selectmen or mayor to convey the property to a former owner, or to a third party for benefit of a former owner, upon such reasonable terms as may be agreed to in writing, including the authority of the municipality to retain a mortgage interest in the property, or to reimpose its tax lien, contingent upon an agreed payment schedule, which need not necessarily reflect any prior redemption amount.  Any such agreement shall be recorded in the registry of deeds.  This paragraph shall not be construed to obligate any municipality to make any such conveyance or agreement.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any town or city may adopt the provisions of RSA 80:58-86 for a real estate tax lien procedure in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In a town, the question shall be placed on the warrant of a special or annual town meeting under the procedures set out in RSA 39:3, and shall be voted on by ballot.  In a city, the legislative body may consider and act upon the question in accordance with their normal procedures for passage of resolutions, ordinances and other legislation.  The legislative body of a city may vote to place the question on the official ballot for any regular municipal election, or, in the alternative, shall place the question on the official ballot for any regular municipal election upon submission to the legislative body of a petition signed by 5 percent of the registered voters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The selectmen or city council shall hold a public hearing on the question at least 15 days but not more than 30 days before the question is to be voted on.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the municipality and published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 7 days before the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The wording of the question shall be:  "Shall we adopt the provisions of RSA 80:58-86 for a real estate tax lien procedure?  These statutes provide that tax sales to private individuals for nonpayment of property taxes on real estate are replaced with a real estate tax lien procedure under which only a municipality or county where the property is located or the state may acquire a tax lien against land and buildings for unpaid taxes.''

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 80:88 Distribution of Proceeds From the Sale of Tax-Deeded Property. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for any sale by a municipality of property which is acquired by tax deed on or after the effective date of this section, the municipality's recovery of proceeds from the sale shall be limited to back taxes, interest, costs and penalty, as defined in RSA 80:90.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If there are excess proceeds over and above the amount of municipal recovery permitted under paragraph I:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Within 60 days of settlement by the purchaser or purchasers of the property sold, the municipality shall file a bill of interpleader with the superior court for the county in which the property is located, naming the former owner or owners, and all persons having a recorded interest in the property as defendants, and paying to the court all amounts over and above those entitled to be retained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The municipality shall also be entitled to retain its reasonable costs and attorneys' fees for the preparation and filing of the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The court shall issue such orders of notice as are necessary, and shall make such disposition of the funds as it finds appropriate, based upon ownership and lienholder interests at the time of the tax deed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The municipality shall be deemed to have a continuing interest in said funds, and in default of valid claims made by other parties, such funds shall be decreed to be the property of the municipality, free and clear of any remaining liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No bill of interpleader shall be necessary under subparagraph II(a) if, at the time of the tax deed execution, there were no record lienholders, and only one record owner or joint owners, and such former owner or owners are easily identified and located, in which case the excess proceeds shall be paid to such owner or owners.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 80:89 Notice to Former Owner and Opportunity for Repurchase. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I.  At least 90 days prior to the offering for sale by a municipality of property which is acquired by tax deed on or after the effective date of this section, the municipal governing body or its designee shall send notice by certified mail, address service requested, return receipt requested, to the last known post office address of the owner of the property at the time of the tax deed, if known, or to the person to whom notice of the impending tax deed was given under RSA 80:77.  The notice shall set forth the terms of the offering and the right of the former owner or owners to repurchase the property, as set forth in paragraph II.  Copies of any such notice shall also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to any mortgagee to whom notice of the impending tax deed was sent under RSA 80:77-a.  For any notice sent pursuant to this paragraph, $10 may be added to the municipality's "costs'' as defined in RSA 80:90.  In this section, an "offering for sale'' means the authorization by the municipality's governing body to its designee to sell the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 30 days after the notice required by paragraph I, or if no such notice is received, at any time within 3 years after the date of recording the tax deed, any former owner of the property may give notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, of intent to repurchase the property from the municipality, and stating that such owner is ready, willing, and able to pay all back taxes, interest, costs and penalty, as defined in RSA 80:90, except that if the property is the former owner's principal residence, or was the former owner's principal residence at the time of execution of the tax deed under RSA 80:76, the additional penalty under RSA 80:90, I(f) shall not apply.  If all such back taxes, interest, costs and penalty have not been actually tendered within 30 days of such notice of intent to repurchase, the municipality may proceed with its offering and dispose of the property without any interest by the former owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The deed from the municipality upon such repurchase shall convey the municipality's interest in the property, or such portion as has not been previously disposed of by the municipality, to all record former owners in the same proportional undivided interests as the former owners of record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The former owners' title upon repurchase shall be subject to any liens of record against the property as of the time of the tax deed to the municipality, and subject to any leases, easements, or other encumbrances as may have been granted or placed on the property by the municipality.  In the case of multiple former owners, any owner paying more than a proportional share of the purchase price to the municipality shall have a lien against the other owners for the amount of the excess paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A notice of intent to repurchase under this section may also be filed by the holder of any recorded mortgage interest in the property which was unredeemed as of the date of the tax deed.  Upon payment the property shall be deeded as provided in paragraph III, but the mortgagee shall be entitled to add the amount paid to the municipality to the amount due under the mortgage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Conveyances to a former owner under this section shall not be subject to the real estate transfer tax under RSA 78-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The duty of the municipality to notify former owners and to distribute proceeds pursuant to RSA 80:88, and the former owners' right of repurchase under this section shall terminate 3 years after the date of recording of the deed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 80:91 Liability and Obligations Limited. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
With respect to actions of a municipality under RSA 80:88 and 80:89, if the municipality has complied with the provisions of this chapter it shall not have any liability whatsoever to any former owner or lienholder in connection with its management of the property or for the amount of consideration received upon disposition of the property.  After the execution of a tax deed, the municipality may treat the property in all respects as the fee owner thereof, including leasing or encumbering all or any portion of the property, without any accountability to former owners, except that the proceeds of any sale must be accounted for as provided in RSA 80:88.  Nothing in this chapter shall obligate a municipality to dispose of property acquired by tax deed, except as provided in RSA 80:89.  Nothing in RSA 80:88 or 80:89 shall be construed to preclude a municipality from granting more favorable terms to a former owner pursuant to RSA 80:80, VI.
