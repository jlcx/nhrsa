&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for any sale by a municipality of property which is acquired by tax deed on or after the effective date of this section, the municipality's recovery of proceeds from the sale shall be limited to back taxes, interest, costs and penalty, as defined in RSA 80:90.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If there are excess proceeds over and above the amount of municipal recovery permitted under paragraph I:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Within 60 days of settlement by the purchaser or purchasers of the property sold, the municipality shall file a bill of interpleader with the superior court for the county in which the property is located, naming the former owner or owners, and all persons having a recorded interest in the property as defendants, and paying to the court all amounts over and above those entitled to be retained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The municipality shall also be entitled to retain its reasonable costs and attorneys' fees for the preparation and filing of the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The court shall issue such orders of notice as are necessary, and shall make such disposition of the funds as it finds appropriate, based upon ownership and lienholder interests at the time of the tax deed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The municipality shall be deemed to have a continuing interest in said funds, and in default of valid claims made by other parties, such funds shall be decreed to be the property of the municipality, free and clear of any remaining liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No bill of interpleader shall be necessary under subparagraph II(a) if, at the time of the tax deed execution, there were no record lienholders, and only one record owner or joint owners, and such former owner or owners are easily identified and located, in which case the excess proceeds shall be paid to such owner or owners.
