&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 80:76 Tax Deed. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The collector, after 2 years from the execution of the real estate tax lien, shall execute to the lienholder a deed of the land subject to the real estate tax lien and not redeemed.  The deed shall be substantially as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Know all men by these presents, That I, __________, collector of taxes for the Town of __________, in the County of __________ and State of New Hampshire, for the year 19___, by the authority in me vested by the laws of the state, and in consideration of __________ to me paid by __________, do hereby sell and convey to __________, the said __________, (here describe the land sold), to have and to hold the said premises with the appurtenances to __________, forever.  And I do hereby covenant with said __________, that in making this conveyance I have in all things complied with the law, and that I have a good right, so far as the right may depend upon the regularity of my own proceedings, to sell and convey the same in manner aforesaid.  In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal the __________ day of __________, __________.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of __________.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, the collector shall not execute a deed of the real estate to a municipality when the governing body of the municipality has notified the collector that it shall not accept the deed because acceptance would subject the municipality to potential liability as an owner of property under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. section 9601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. section 6901 et seq., RSA 147-A and 147-B, and any other federal or state environmental statute which imposes strict liability on owners for environmental impairment of the real estate involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. In addition to the circumstances described in paragraph II, the governing body of the municipality may refuse to accept a tax deed on behalf of the municipality, and may so notify the collector, whenever in its judgment acceptance and ownership of the real estate would subject the municipality to undesirable obligations or liability risks, including obligations under real estate covenants or obligations to tenants, or for any other reason would be contrary to the public interest.  Such a decision shall not be made solely for the private benefit of a taxpayer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a governing body has, under paragraph II or II-a, served notice upon the collector it shall not accept the deed, the tax lien shall remain in effect indefinitely, retaining its priority over other liens.  The taxpayer's right of redemption as provided by RSA 80:69 shall likewise be extended indefinitely, with interest continuing to accrue as provided in that section.  The tax lien may be enforced by the municipality by suit as provided under RSA 80:50, and through any remedy provided by law for the enforcement of other types of liens and attachments.  If at any time, in the judgment of the municipal governing body, the reasons for refusing the tax deed no longer apply, and the tax lien has not been satisfied, the governing body may instruct the collector to issue the tax deed, and the collector shall do so after giving the notices required by RSA 80:77 and 80:77-a.
