&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 80:69 Redemption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any person with a legal interest in land subject to a real estate tax lien may redeem the same by paying or tendering to the collector, at any time before a deed thereof is given by the collector, the amount of the real estate lien, with interest at 18 percent per annum upon the whole amount of the recorded lien from the date of execution to the time of payment in full, except that in the case of partial payments in redemption made under RSA 80:71, the interest shall be computed on the unpaid balance, together with redemption costs and costs for identifying and notifying the mortgagees, if any.  In case the tax collector who executed the tax lien against the property in question shall have died, become incapacitated, been removed from office or removed from the town or city or shall have been discharged from his bond by the selectmen or assessors, then the person with the legal interest in redeeming the property may tender such sums to the tax collector then in office of said city or town.  Upon advice from the selectmen or assessors that the amount tendered is the correct amount due, the tax collector shall accept said amount for the redemption of the property.
