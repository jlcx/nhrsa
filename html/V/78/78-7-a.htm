&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 78:7-a Nature of Tax.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
All taxes upon tobacco products under this chapter are declared to be a direct tax upon the consumer at retail and shall conclusively be presumed to be pre-collected for the purpose of convenience and facility only by the affixing of tax stamps for cigarettes and the filing of returns and payment of tax for other tobacco products under RSA 78:12.  Accordingly, the commissioner may collect the tax directly from consumers who purchase tobacco products without documentation to evidence tax paid.
