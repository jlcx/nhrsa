In case such stamps are destroyed before they are affixed, the commissioner shall refund the purchase price upon presentation of evidence of such destruction satisfactory to the commissioner.  The commissioner shall refund the purchase price for stamps and metered impressions which are destroyed after affixing to outdated, damaged, or unsaleable tobacco products.
