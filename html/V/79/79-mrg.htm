Stumpage value of all forest products except those customarily measured by the cord, by weight, or by the piece shall be determined on the basis of international  1/4 inch rule log scale.  If there are questions by the assessors regarding the true and accurate stumpage values reflected in contracts presented by the owner as the basis for timber tax assessment, the department of revenue administration, municipal and property division, shall be available to assist or advise the municipalities in the proper calculation of the stumpage value for assessment purposes.  The burden shall be upon the owner filing the "Report of Wood Cut'' form to demonstrate the reasonableness of a claim under this paragraph.

"Sugar orchard'' means a stand of Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) and/or Red Maple (Acer rubrum) used actively and primarily as a source of sap for the production of maple syrup or related maple products.  Active use shall mean that a substantial portion of the maple trees appropriate for tapping of sap are being tapped at least once every 3 years.  Such stands shall have clearly established boundaries, and a defined area.  In the stand, 50 percent or more of the average basal area of all live trees 2 inches or greater diameter at breast height (dbh) shall be composed of Sugar Maples and/or Red Maples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79:10 Notice of Intent to Cut. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Every owner, as defined in RSA 79:1, II, shall, prior to commencing each cutting operation and at the beginning of each new tax year into which the cutting operation shall continue, file with the proper assessing officials in the city, town, or unincorporated place where such cutting is to take place a notice of intent to cut provided by the commissioner of revenue administration, stating the owner's name, residence, an estimate of the volume of each species to be cut, and such other information as may be required.  A supplemental notice of intent shall be filed in the same manner for any additional volume of wood or timber to be cut in excess of the original estimate and within the tax year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any intent received by a city, town, or unincorporated place shall, within 30 days, be assigned a number in accordance with the guidelines provided by the commissioner of revenue administration, and be signed by the assessing officials.  If the conditions for approval have not been met, the assessing officials shall send a letter to the owner or the person responsible for cutting, explaining the reason for the intent not being signed.  The assessing officials shall immediately forward any signed intent to the commissioner of revenue administration and shall also supply a copy to the owner upon request.  Failure of the assessing officials to forward signed intent to cut forms to the department of revenue administration shall constitute a violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The assessing officials shall, within 30 days of signing a notice of intent, notify the tax collector that an intent has been filed.  The notice of intent shall serve as notice that the land is holden to taxes pursuant to RSA 79:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon receipt of an intent, the commissioner of revenue administration shall furnish, without cost to the owner, a certificate and a report of wood cut form.  Such certificate shall be posted by the owner filing such intent in a conspicuous place within the area of cutting for each operation conducted within a city, town, or unincorporated place.  An owner may start an operation upon posting the certificate or upon posting, in a water proof covering in the same place and manner that the certificate will be posted upon receipt, a copy of the intent to cut form that was signed by the assessing officials.  In lieu of a signed intent to cut form, a copy of the form as submitted by the owner to the assessing officials may be substituted for posting purposes when the owner, or the person responsible for the cut, has been notified that the intent to cut form has been signed.  The owner, or the person responsible for the cut, shall clearly print on the form the number assigned to it pursuant to subparagraph (b), and the date, time, and name of the municipal official or employee who provided the notification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Starting or continuing an operation while the required certificate or intent to cut form is not posted in accordance with this section shall constitute a violation by the owner or any other person doing the cutting, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Starting an operation before the original notice of intent to cut or supplemental intent to cut has been filed with the city or town and signed by the appropriate municipal officials shall constitute a violation by the owner or any other person doing the cutting, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A copy of all intents received by the commissioner of revenue administration shall be forwarded to the division of forests and lands of the department of resources and economic development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, any owner who has commenced cutting operations under a valid notice of intent to cut prior to April 1 shall not be required to file for a new notice of intent if the cutting operation will be completed prior to June 30 of that year.  However, any owner who will complete a cutting operation after April 1 but prior to June 30 of the same year under a valid notice of intent to cut filed before April 1 shall, prior to April 1, notify in writing the assessing officials with whom the notice of intent to cut was filed that the cutting operation will extend beyond April 1.

The report shall be upon a form provided by the commissioner of revenue administration, with 2 copies to be sent to him.  The report shall state if no growing wood and timber was cut on an operation for which a notice of intent to cut was filed.  The assessing officials may require that a report of cut be filed immediately upon the completion or termination of the cutting referred to in a notice of intent to cut.  Reports of cut shall contain the name, residence of the owner, volume of wood and timber cut by species or species group and primary products, and such other information as may be necessary to enable the assessing officials to locate, identify, verify and determine the full amount and true stumpage value of all wood and timber cut on the operation for which the report is filed.  In addition, the person who did the cutting or the person responsible for the cutting must sign and verify the volumes of wood and timber reported to have been cut by the owner.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall send one copy of the report of cut to the division of forests and lands of the department of resources and economic development.  A report of wood and timber severed covering operations still in progress through March 31 of any year shall be filed not later than May 15 of said year for all wood and timber severed during the tax year up to and including March 31.

In any case where the report of cut is not filed within 24 hours of the request for the report, the assessing officials may make a special assessment of the yield tax basing the assessment on such evidence as is available to them.  The collector upon receipt of the warrant shall make demand for payment of such tax and may use any provisions of law to collect the tax committed to him in such warrant.  In a case where an owner has terminated or completed an operation at least 30 days prior to April 1 of any year, he may, after filing the report of cut as required by RSA 79:11, request that the assessing officials make a special assessment of the yield tax against the owner of the wood and timber severed on such operation.  In such cases the assessing officials shall make such special assessment of the yield tax and commit a warrant to the collector for the same and the collector shall proceed in the collection of the same.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79:14 Collection and Distribution of Normal Yield Taxes in Unincorporated Towns and Unorganized Places. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The taxes assessed under RSA 79:3 in any unincorporated town or unorganized place shall be collected by the county commissioners of the county in which the town or place is located and paid by them to the county treasurer.  The county commissioners shall have the same powers in collecting the taxes as provided under RSA 80 and RSA 81.  The county treasurer shall distribute the normal yield taxes in the unincorporated towns and unorganized places as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To the county commissioners the cost of assessment, collection and any appeal in the unincorporated towns and unorganized places;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To the division of forests and lands, department of resources and economic development, any normal yield tax revenues remaining in the county treasury after the above distribution has been made in such amounts as may be determined by the appropriate county legislative delegation after consultation with the county commissioners and the director of the division of forests and lands.  The funds shall be maintained in a nonlapsing account known as the "unincorporated towns and unorganized places forest conservation fund.''  The funds shall only be used by the director of forests and lands in or for the benefit of the towns and places from which the tax has been collected.  The funds allocated for the use of the director of the division of forests and lands shall be paid over to the state treasurer by the county treasurer no later than October 1 of the state fiscal year in which the allocation takes place by the appropriate county legislative delegation.  The unincorporated towns and unorganized places forest conservation fund shall be used for land use regulation purposes and for forest conservation purposes, including, but not limited to, the construction and maintenance of forest protection facilities and equipment, fire protection and detection, fire suppression supplies, fire access roads and bridges, fire prevention patrols, fire trails, and forest insects and disease control.  The unincorporated towns and unorganized places forest conservation fund shall not, for each county, exceed 2 times the average budget for the previous 2 years as approved by each respective county legislative delegation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any remaining unallocated funds shall be credited to the unincorporated towns and unorganized places from which the normal yield taxes were collected in the prior 2 years on a pro-rated basis.  Such funds shall be used against an unincorporated town's or an unorganized place's share of the county tax for the ensuing year.
