&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79:8 Appeal and Abatement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
An owner may, within 90 days of notice of the tax, appeal to the assessing officials in writing for an abatement from the original assessment, but no owner shall be entitled to an abatement unless the owner has complied with the provisions of RSA 79:10 and RSA 79:11.  If the assessing officials neglect or refuse to abate, an owner may, at his or her election within 6 months of notice of such tax and not afterwards, petition the superior court of the county where the operation took place, or the board of tax and land appeals. The owner shall not be subject to a fee for filing such appeal with the board of tax and land appeals. During the appeal, the board of tax and land appeals, on its own motion or by request of the owner or municipality made to the board of tax and land appeals, shall have the discretion to call upon the department of revenue administration and the division of forests and lands, department of resources and economic development, to provide expert testimony at no cost to the party.
