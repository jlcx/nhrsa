&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-D:4 Returns.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every ICF shall on or before the 10th day of the month following the expiration of the assessment period make a return to the commissioner and to the commissioner of the department of health and human services.  The commissioner may adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the form of such return and the date which it must contain for the correct computation of facility net patient services revenues and the assessment upon such amount.  All returns shall be signed by the authorized representative of the ICF, subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.

<center><h3>Section 84-D:5</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-D:5 Collection and Deposit of Assessment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
There is hereby established a nonlapsing ICF separate account in the office of the state treasurer.  All funds collected under this chapter and any federal financial participation received by the state as a result of expenditures funded by the ICF quality assessments, and the interest thereon, shall be deposited in this account.  Moneys from the account shall not be expended by the state or any state agency for any purpose other than funding ICF expenditures as provided in RSA 151-E:15-a.

<center><h3>Section 84-D:6</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-D:6 Additional Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the commissioner has reason to believe that an ICF has failed to file a return or to include any part of its net patient services revenue in a filed return, the commissioner may require the ICF to file a return or a supplementary return showing such additional information as the commissioner prescribes.  Upon the receipt of the supplementary return, or if none is received within the time set by the commissioner, the commissioner may find and assess the amount due upon the information that is available.  The making of such additional return does not relieve the ICF of any penalty for failure to make a correct original return or relieve it from liability for interest imposed under RSA 21-J:28 or any other additional charges imposed by the commissioner.  This section shall not be construed to modify the statute of limitations provided in RSA 21-J:29.

<center><h3>Section 84-D:7</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-D:7 Extension of Time for Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For good cause, the commissioner may extend the time within which an ICF is required to file a return, and if such return is filed during the period of extension no penalty or late filing charge may be imposed for failure to file the return at the time required by this chapter, but the ICF shall be liable for interest and late payment charges as prescribed in RSA 21-J:28 or RSA 21-J:33.  Failure to file the return during the period of the extension shall void the extension.
