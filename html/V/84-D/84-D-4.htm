&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-D:4 Returns.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every ICF shall on or before the 10th day of the month following the expiration of the assessment period make a return to the commissioner and to the commissioner of the department of health and human services.  The commissioner may adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the form of such return and the date which it must contain for the correct computation of facility net patient services revenues and the assessment upon such amount.  All returns shall be signed by the authorized representative of the ICF, subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.  If such return shows an overpayment of the assessment due, the commissioner shall refund or credit the overpayment to the ICF.
