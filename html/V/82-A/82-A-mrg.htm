&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 82-A:3 Imposition of Tax;  Intrastate Communications Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A tax is imposed upon intrastate communications services furnished to a person in this state and purchased at retail from a retailer by such person, at the rate of 7 percent of the gross charge therefor.  However, such tax is not imposed on any communications services to the extent a tax on such services may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the state.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 82-A:4 Imposition of Tax;  Interstate Communications Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Except as provided in RSA 82-A:4-b, a tax is imposed upon interstate communications services and private communications services furnished to a person in this state and purchased at retail from a retailer by such person, at the rate of 7 percent of the gross charge when such service purchased on a call-by call basis originates in this state and terminates outside this state or originates outside this state and terminates in this state and the service address is in this state, or when such service purchased on a basis other than a call-by-call basis is provided to a person with a place of primary use in this state or when such private communications services are apportioned to this state in accordance with RSA 82-A:4-c.  Provided however, a tax is imposed upon interstate paid calling service furnished to a person in this state and purchased at retail from a retailer by such person, at the rate of 7 percent of the gross charge when the origination point of the communications signal (as first identified by either (a) the seller's telecommunications system, or (b) information received by the seller from its service provider, where the system used to transport such signals is not that of the seller) is in this state.  To prevent actual multi-state taxation of communications services that are subject to taxation under this section, any taxpayer, upon proof that that taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed in this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state.  However, such tax is not imposed on communications services to the extent such services may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the state.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 82-A:4-b Special Rules for Mobile Telecommunications Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tax is imposed on intrastate and interstate communication services that are mobile telecommunications services deemed to be provided by the taxpayer's home service provider whose territorial limits encompass the taxpayer's place of primary use, regardless of where the mobile telecommunication services originate, terminate, or pass through.  The tax shall be imposed on the gross charge at the rate specified in RSA 82-A:3 and RSA 82-A:4.  No tax shall be imposed on a customer whose place of primary use is outside this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Mobile telecommunications services provided to a taxpayer, the charges for which are billed by or for the taxpayer's home service provider, are deemed to be provided by the home service provider.  Intrastate mobile telecommunications services provided by a home service provider are subject to the tax imposed by this chapter if they are billed to a taxpayer with a place of primary use in this state and they originate and terminate in this state or originate and terminate in any single state.  Interstate mobile telecommunications services provided by a home service provider are subject to the tax imposed by this chapter if they are billed to a taxpayer with a place of primary use in this state and they originate in one state and terminate in another state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In order to assign the place of primary use for mobile telecommunications services pursuant to the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, Public Law 106-252, the commissioner may choose whether to furnish home service providers with a database that matches addresses with taxing jurisdictions or to allow home service providers to employ an enhanced zip code in lieu of providing a database.  A home service provider that uses a database furnished by the commissioner or, if no database is provided, an enhanced zip code shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of reliance on such database or enhanced zip code, provided that the provisions of 4 U.S.C. sections 119, 120, and 121 are followed by the home service provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) A home service provider shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining the taxpayer's place of primary use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the home service provider relies, in good faith, on the information provided by the taxpayer such home service provider shall not be liable for any additional taxes, charges or fees based on a different determination by the department of the place of primary use.  The home service provider shall change the place of primary use determined by the department on a prospective basis commencing on the date of notification by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subject to subparagraph (b), a home service provider may treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes for any taxpayer under a service contract or agreement in effect prior to July 28, 2002 as the place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Any taxpayer who alleges that an amount of tax, or the assignment of the place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included in the billing is erroneous shall notify the home service provider in writing of the error.  The taxpayer shall include the street address for the taxpayer's place of primary use, the account name and number for which the correction is sought, a description of the alleged error, and any other information requested by the home service provider necessary to process the request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The home service provider shall conduct a review of its records and the electronic database or enhanced zip code used to determine the place of primary use within 60 days of receiving the notice from the taxpayer.  If it is determined that the amount of tax or the assignment of the place or primary use or taxing jurisdiction is in error, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected from the taxpayer for a period of 3 years.  If it is determined that the amount of tax or the assignment of the place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation to the taxpayer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A taxpayer seeking correction of assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction, or a refund or credit of taxes erroneously collected by the home service provider shall seek to have the error corrected pursuant to these provisions before any cause of action arises as a result of such error.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In instances where the home service provider does not separately list charges for taxable and non-taxable mobile telecommunications services, such charges shall be subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter, unless the home service provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to such tax from its books and records kept in the ordinary course of business.  A taxpayer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for mobile telecommunications services unless the taxpayer's home service provider separately states the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the home service provider elects, after receiving written notice from the taxpayer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identify the nontaxable charges.

If the retailer's average monthly tax billings due to the department do not exceed $100, the department may authorize his returns to be filed on a quarter annual basis, with the return for January, February and March of each year being due by April 15 of such year;  with the return for April, May and June of each year being due by July 15 of such year;  with the return for July, August and September of each year being due by October 15 of such year;  and with the return for October, November and December of each year being due by January 15 of the following year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter containing the time within which a retailer may file his return, in the case of any retailer who ceases to engage in a kind of business which makes him responsible for filing returns under this chapter, such retailer shall file a final return under this chapter with the department not more than one month after discontinuing such business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In making such return, the retailer shall determine the value of any consideration other than money received by him and he shall include such value in his return.  Such determination shall be subject to review and revision by the department in the manner hereinafter provided for the correction of returns.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Each retailer whose average monthly liability to the department under this chapter is reasonably estimated to be in excess of $10,000 shall make estimated payments to the department on or before the fifteenth day of the month during which tax collection liability to the department is incurred in an amount equal to 90 percent of the retailer's actual tax collections for the same calendar month of the preceding year or, if no tax was collected in the preceding year, 90 percent of the reasonably estimated tax collections for the month.  The amount of such estimated payments shall be credited against the final liability of the retailer's return for that month.  Any outstanding credit, approved by the department, arising from the retailer's overpayment of its final liability for any month may be applied to reduce the amount of any subsequent estimated payment or credited against the final liability of the retailer's return for any subsequent month.  If any estimated payment is not paid at the time or in the amount required by this section, the retailer shall be liable for penalty and interest on the difference between the minimum amount due as a payment and the amount of such payment actually and timely paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the commissioner finds that the information required for the making of an accurate return cannot reasonably be compiled by a retailer within 15 days after the close of the calendar month for which a return is to be made, he may grant an extension of time for the filing of such return for a period not to exceed 31 calendar days.  The granting of such an extension may be conditioned upon the deposit by the retailer with the department of an amount of money not exceeding the amount estimated by the commissioner to be due with the return so extended.  All such deposits, including any heretofore made with the department, shall be credited against the retailer's liabilities under this chapter.  If any such deposit exceeds the retailer's present and probable future liabilities under this chapter, the department shall issue to the retailer a credit memorandum, which may be assigned by the retailer to a similar retailer under this chapter, in accordance with reasonable rules to be prescribed by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The retailer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time of making such return, pay to the department the amount of tax herein imposed.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a taxpayer does not pay the tax imposed by this chapter to a retailer, such taxpayer shall file a return with the department and pay the tax upon that portion of gross charges so paid to the retailer during the preceding calendar month by the fifteenth day of the month following that month.  Such return shall be filed on a form prescribed by the department and shall contain such information as the department may reasonably require.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in this section, providing communications services in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.
