&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 82-A:4 Imposition of Tax;  Interstate Communications Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Except as provided in RSA 82-A:4-b, a tax is imposed upon interstate communications services and private communications services furnished to a person in this state and purchased at retail from a retailer by such person, at the rate of 7 percent of the gross charge when such service purchased on a call-by call basis originates in this state and terminates outside this state or originates outside this state and terminates in this state and the service address is in this state, or when such service purchased on a basis other than a call-by-call basis is provided to a person with a place of primary use in this state or when such private communications services are apportioned to this state in accordance with RSA 82-A:4-c.  Provided however, a tax is imposed upon interstate paid calling service furnished to a person in this state and purchased at retail from a retailer by such person, at the rate of 7 percent of the gross charge when the origination point of the communications signal (as first identified by either (a) the seller's telecommunications system, or (b) information received by the seller from its service provider, where the system used to transport such signals is not that of the seller) is in this state.  To prevent actual multi-state taxation of communications services that are subject to taxation under this section, any taxpayer, upon proof that that taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed in this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state.  However, such tax is not imposed on communications services to the extent such services may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the state.
