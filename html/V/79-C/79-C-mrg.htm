&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-C:1 Declaration of Public Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared to be in the public interest to encourage the preservation of open space which is potentially subject to development, thus providing a healthful and attractive outdoor environment for work and recreation of the state's citizens, maintaining the character of the state's landscape, and conserving the land, water, forest, agricultural, recreational, and wildlife resources.  It is further declared to be in the public interest to prevent the loss of open space due to property taxation at values incompatible with open space usage.  The means for encouraging preservation of open space authorized by this chapter is the acquisition of discretionary easements of development rights by town or city governments on such open space land which provides a demonstrated public benefit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-C:4 Application Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any owner of land which meets the tests of public benefit in RSA 79-C:3, II may apply to the governing body to grant a discretionary easement to the municipality not to subdivide, develop, or otherwise change the use of such land to a more intensive use inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No owner of land shall be entitled to have a particular parcel of land classified for any tax year under the provisions of this chapter unless the owner has applied to the governing body on or before April 15 of the tax year on a form provided by the commissioner of the department of revenue administration.  Such application shall include a map of the land to be subject to the discretionary easement, a description of how the property meets the tests of public benefit in RSA 79-C:3, and an appraisal of the value of the easement to be conveyed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-C:5 Approval, Denial. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the governing body finds that the proposed use of such land is consistent with the purposes of this chapter, it may take steps to acquire discretionary easements as provided in this chapter.  In exercising its discretion, the local governing body may weigh the public benefit to be obtained versus the tax revenue to be lost if such an easement is granted.  The governing body shall have no more than 60 days to act upon the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the governing body denies the application to grant a discretionary easement to the municipality, such denial shall be accompanied by a written explanation.  The local governing body's decision may be appealed using the procedures of either RSA 79-A:9 or 79-A:11, provided, however, that such denial shall be deemed discretionary and shall not be set aside by the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court except for bad faith, discrimination, or the application of criteria other than those set forth in RSA 79-C:3 and paragraph I of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The easement shall be a burden upon the land and shall bind all transferees and assignees of such land.  An easement granted pursuant to this subdivision shall not be assigned, transferred, or released by the municipality without the consent of the owner, except as provided in RSA 79-C:8.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-C:7 Assessment of Land Subject to Discretionary Easement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The method of assessment of discretionary easement land, excluding any buildings, their curtilage, appurtenances, or other improvements, shall be included as a term of the agreement in any discretionary easement acquired by a municipality, and shall fall within a range of values determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. One end of the range shall consist of the value such land would have been assigned under the current use values established pursuant to RSA 79-A, if the land had met the criteria for open space land under that chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The other end of the range shall be determined by multiplying 75 percent of the land's fair market value by the current equalization rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The local governing body shall have the discretion to set the value of the discretionary easement at a level within this range which it believes reflects the public benefit conferred by the property, under the criteria set forth in RSA 79-C:3 and RSA 79-C:5, I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-C:8 Release of Easement, Expiration, Renewal, Consideration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any landowner who has granted a discretionary easement to a municipality pursuant to the terms of this chapter, after the effective date of this chapter, may apply to the local governing body of the municipality in which the property subject to a discretionary easement is located for a release from such easement upon a demonstration of extreme personal hardship.  Upon release from such easement, a landowner shall pay the following consideration to the tax collector of the municipality:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For a release within the first half of the duration of the easement, 20 percent of the RSA 75:1 full value assessment of such land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For a release within the second half of the duration of the easement, 15 percent of the RSA 75:1 full value assessment of such land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The terms of agreement may include specification of an amount, if any, up to 10 percent of fair market value, to be paid upon final expiration of the terms of the discretionary easement or renewed discretionary easement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the expiration of the terms of the discretionary easement, the owner may apply for a renewal, and the owner and local governing body shall have the same rights and duties with respect to the renewal application as they did with respect to the original application;  provided, however, that at the time of the original granting of the discretionary easement, the parties may include, as a term of the agreement, a provision for automatic renewal for the same term as the original.  Such a provision may include the specification of the manner in which the tax assessment on the property for the next term is to be determined at the time of renewal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The tax collector shall issue a receipt to the owner of such land and a copy to the local governing body for the sums paid.  The local governing body shall, upon receiving a copy of the above-mentioned consideration, execute a release or renewal of the easement to the owner who shall record such a release or renewal.  A copy of such release or renewal shall also be sent to the local assessing officials if they are not the same parties executing the release.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a consideration is due under RSA 79-C:8, I or II, the assessed value shall be determined as of the actual date of the release or expiration.  Any consideration is in addition to the annual real estate tax imposed upon the property, and shall be due and payable upon the release or expiration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any consideration shall be due and payable by the owner at the time of release or expiration to the municipality in which the property is located.  If the property is located in an unincorporated town or unorganized place, the tax shall be due and payable by the owner at the time of release or expiration to the county in which the property is located.  Moneys paid to a county under this chapter shall be used to pay for the cost of services provided in RSA 28:7-a and RSA 28:7-b.  Any consideration shall be due and payable according to the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The commissioner shall prescribe and issue forms to the local assessing officials for the consideration due, which shall provide a description of the property, the discretionary easement, the RSA 75:1 full value assessment, and the amount payable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prescribed form shall be prepared in quadruplicate.  The original, duplicate, and triplicate copy of the form shall be given to the collector of taxes for collection of the consideration along with a special tax warrant authorizing the collector to collect the consideration under the warrant.  The quadruplicate copy of the form shall be retained by the local assessing officials for their records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon receipt of the special tax warrant and prescribed forms, the tax collector shall mail the duplicate copy of the tax bill to the owner responsible for the tax as the notice of tax.  Such bill shall be mailed within 12 months of the release or expiration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Payment of the consideration shall be due not later than 30 days after the mailing of the bill.  Interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum shall be due thereafter on any consideration not paid within the 30-day period.
