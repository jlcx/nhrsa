&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any landowner who has granted a discretionary easement to a municipality pursuant to the terms of this chapter, after the effective date of this chapter, may apply to the local governing body of the municipality in which the property subject to a discretionary easement is located for a release from such easement upon a demonstration of extreme personal hardship.  Upon release from such easement, a landowner shall pay the following consideration to the tax collector of the municipality:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For a release within the first half of the duration of the easement, 20 percent of the RSA 75:1 full value assessment of such land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For a release within the second half of the duration of the easement, 15 percent of the RSA 75:1 full value assessment of such land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The terms of agreement may include specification of an amount, if any, up to 10 percent of fair market value, to be paid upon final expiration of the terms of the discretionary easement or renewed discretionary easement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the expiration of the terms of the discretionary easement, the owner may apply for a renewal, and the owner and local governing body shall have the same rights and duties with respect to the renewal application as they did with respect to the original application;  provided, however, that at the time of the original granting of the discretionary easement, the parties may include, as a term of the agreement, a provision for automatic renewal for the same term as the original.  Such a provision may include the specification of the manner in which the tax assessment on the property for the next term is to be determined at the time of renewal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The tax collector shall issue a receipt to the owner of such land and a copy to the local governing body for the sums paid.  The local governing body shall, upon receiving a copy of the above-mentioned consideration, execute a release or renewal of the easement to the owner who shall record such a release or renewal.  A copy of such release or renewal shall also be sent to the local assessing officials if they are not the same parties executing the release.
