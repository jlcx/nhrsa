&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-C:7 Assessment of Land Subject to Discretionary Easement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The method of assessment of discretionary easement land, excluding any buildings, their curtilage, appurtenances, or other improvements, shall be included as a term of the agreement in any discretionary easement acquired by a municipality, and shall fall within a range of values determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. One end of the range shall consist of the value such land would have been assigned under the current use values established pursuant to RSA 79-A, if the land had met the criteria for open space land under that chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The other end of the range shall be determined by multiplying 75 percent of the land's fair market value by the current equalization rate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The local governing body shall have the discretion to set the value of the discretionary easement at a level within this range which it believes reflects the public benefit conferred by the property, under the criteria set forth in RSA 79-C:3 and RSA 79-C:5, I.
