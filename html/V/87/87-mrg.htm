&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 87:1 Tax Imposed. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An estate tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the estate of every decedent leaving an estate which is subject to an estate tax under the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and who has property within this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amount of the New Hampshire estate tax shall be equal to the maximum federal estate tax credit allowable for state death taxes with respect to property subject to this state's jurisdiction to impose a tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If only a portion of a decedent's estate is located in this state, such maximum tax credit shall be determined by multiplying the entire amount of the credit allowable by the percentage which the gross value of the portion of the decedent's estate located in this state bears to the gross value of the entire estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This tax shall be imposed in every case in which the credit for state death taxes paid is available as a credit on the decedent's federal estate tax return.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 87:6 Returns and Extensions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The executor or administrator of the estate of every decedent whose death gives rise to a tax liability under this chapter shall, within the time prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service to file a federal estate tax return, file a return with the commissioner of revenue administration.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the form of such return and the data which it must contain for the correct computation of the New Hampshire estate tax.  All returns shall be signed by the administrator or executor and the return preparer if other than the administrator or executor, subject to the pains and penalty of perjury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It shall be the duty of the legal representative of the estate of any decedent who was a resident of this state at the time of his death and whose estate may be subject to the payment of a United States estate tax to attach a duplicate copy of the United States estate tax return as filed with the Internal Revenue Service to the return required by paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For good cause, the commissioner may extend the time within which a taxpayer is required to file a return, and if such return is filed during the period of extension, no penalty for the failure to file under RSA 21-J:31 shall be imposed, but the executor or administrator shall be liable for interest as prescribed in RSA 21-J:28.  An extension of time for filing a return shall not extend the time for the payment of the taxes due under this chapter.  Failure to file the return within the period of the extension shall void such extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the commissioner has reason to believe that an executor or administrator has failed to file a return or include any part of the taxable property in a filed return, the commissioner may require the executor or administrator to file a return or a supplementary return showing such additional information as the commissioner prescribes.  Upon receipt of the supplementary return, or if none is received within the time set by the commissioner, the commissioner may find and assess the amount due upon the information that is available.  The making of such returns by the commissioner shall not relieve the executor or administrator of any penalty for the failure to make a correct original return or relieve them from the liability for interest imposed under RSA 21-J:28 or any other additional charges imposed by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The failure to file returns, the filing of fraudulent returns or the making, causing to be made or permitting to be made any false entry in the books or records of the estate with the intent to defraud the state or to evade the payment of the tax or any part thereof shall subject the executor or administrator to the penalties provided in RSA 21-J for such actions.
