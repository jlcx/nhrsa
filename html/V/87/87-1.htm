&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An estate tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the estate of every decedent leaving an estate which is subject to an estate tax under the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and who has property within this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amount of the New Hampshire estate tax shall be equal to the maximum federal estate tax credit allowable for state death taxes with respect to property subject to this state's jurisdiction to impose a tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If only a portion of a decedent's estate is located in this state, such maximum tax credit shall be determined by multiplying the entire amount of the credit allowable by the percentage which the gross value of the portion of the decedent's estate located in this state bears to the gross value of the entire estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This tax shall be imposed in every case in which the credit for state death taxes paid is available as a credit on the decedent's federal estate tax return.
