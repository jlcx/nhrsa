&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72:1-c Optional Collection of Resident Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any town or city by majority vote of the legislative body may elect not to assess, levy and collect a resident tax.  All municipalities which elect not to assess, levy or collect said resident tax shall be exempt from all provisions of law relating to it.  The provisions of RSA 261:71 and 261:72 shall not apply to residents of municipalities not so assessing, levying or collecting the resident tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislative body of any town or city may adopt the provisions of paragraph I by approving the following question:  "Shall we adopt the provisions of RSA 72:1-c which authorize any town or city to elect not to assess, levy and collect a resident tax?''  If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes'', RSA 72:1-c shall apply within the town or city on April 1 following the approval of the question.  Any town or city may rescind the provisions of RSA 72:1-c in the same manner, except the word "adopt'' shall be changed to "rescind'' in the question.
