<codesect>
The real estate and personal property of Letitia Pratt Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit corporation providing community housing for physically disabled and elderly persons, if none of the income or profits of the community housing is used for any purpose other than the purpose for which the housing is established, shall be exempt from taxation.  For the purpose of this section an elderly person is one who is 62 years or more of age.  The age of the head of the family determines the eligibility of the family unit in the community housing.  On or before December 1 of each year the owner of the community housing shall pay to the town or city in which the property is situated, in lieu of taxes, a sum representing 10 percent of the shelter rent received by the owner during the preceding calendar year.  For cause shown, having in mind the nature and purpose of the corporation, the board of tax and land appeals may abate all or a portion of the payment in lieu of taxes in any year.  The owner shall on or before June 1 of each year file with the municipality in which the property is located, upon a form prescribed and provided by the board of tax and land appeals, a statement of its financial condition for the preceding fiscal year and such other information as the board of tax and land appeals requires.
