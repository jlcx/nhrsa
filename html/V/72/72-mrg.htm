&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any town or city by majority vote of the legislative body may elect not to assess, levy and collect a resident tax.  All municipalities which elect not to assess, levy or collect said resident tax shall be exempt from all provisions of law relating to it.  The provisions of RSA 261:71 and 261:72 shall not apply to residents of municipalities not so assessing, levying or collecting the resident tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislative body of any town or city may adopt the provisions of paragraph I by approving the following question:  "Shall we adopt the provisions of RSA 72:1-c which authorize any town or city to elect not to assess, levy and collect a resident tax?''  If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes'', RSA 72:1-c shall apply within the town or city on April 1 following the approval of the question.  Any town or city may rescind the provisions of RSA 72:1-c in the same manner, except the word "adopt'' shall be changed to "rescind'' in the question.

This paragraph shall not apply to manufactured housing held for sale or storage by an agent or dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Manufactured housing, as defined in RSA 205-A:1, I, suitable for use for domestic, commercial, or industrial purposes is taxable as real estate in the town, city or unincorporated place to which it is brought and located after April 1 and before the following January 1, provided that said manufactured housing remains in said town, city, or unincorporated place for more than 10 weeks, except for storage only, and further provided a tax has not been assessed on it elsewhere in the state for that year.  The tax shall be for the pro rata part of the tax year remaining when said manufactured housing became located in the town, city, or unincorporated place.  The selectmen or assessors may so require and it shall be an obligation of the owner to file with the selectmen or assessors a true and correct inventory of the property subject to taxation under this paragraph within 15 days of the location of the manufactured housing in such form as the commissioner of revenue administration may prescribe.

In making its investigation, the department may inspect the facility and request such other information from the applicant as is reasonably necessary to assist it in making its determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon making its determination, the department shall notify the applicant and the taxing authorities of the municipality where the facility is situated whether the purpose of the facility is solely pollution control, or, if not, what percentage of the applicant's investment in the facility should be allocated to pollution control.

V. The taxing authorities shall each year separately appraise and describe the facility and related real estate and cause such appraisal and description to appear in their inventory.  In accordance with the provisions of this section, the taxing authority shall exempt from the taxes levied under this chapter the appraised value of the facility and any real estate necessary therefor, or the exempt percentage thereof, determined by the department.  The exemption period shall begin as of the April 1 next following the receipt of the department's determination.

The following real estate and personal property shall, unless otherwise provided by statute, be exempt from taxation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Lands and the buildings and structures thereon and therein and the personal property owned by the state of New Hampshire or by a New Hampshire city, town, school district, or village district unless said real or personal property is used or occupied by other than the state or a city, town, school district, or village district under a lease or other agreement the terms of which provide for the payment of properly assessed real and personal property taxes by the party using or occupying said property.  The exemption provided herein shall apply to any and all taxes against lands and the buildings and structures thereon and therein and the personal property owned by the state, cities, towns, school districts, and village districts, which have or may have accrued since March 31, 1975, and to any and all future taxes which, but for the exemption provided herein, would accrue against lands and buildings and structures thereon and therein and the personal property owned by the state, cities, towns, school districts, and village districts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) All leases and other agreements, the terms of which provide for the use or occupation by others of real or personal property owned by the state or a city, town, school district, or village district, entered into after July 1, 1979, shall provide for the payment of properly assessed real and personal property taxes by the party using or occupying said property no later than the due date.  This subparagraph shall not apply to leases of state-owned railroad properties which are subject to railroad taxes under the provisions of RSA 82 or which provide revenue to the state, a portion of which is distributed to cities and towns pursuant to RSA 228:69, I(a).  All such leases and agreements shall include a provision that "failure of the lessee to pay the duly assessed personal and real estate taxes when due shall be cause to terminate said lease or agreement by the lessor.''  All such leases and agreements entered into on or after January 1, 1994, shall clearly state the lessee's obligations regarding the payment of both current and potential real and personal property taxes, and shall also state whether the lessee has an obligation to pay real and personal property taxes on structures or improvements added by the lessee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the lessee using or occupying the property fails to pay the duly assessed personal and real estate taxes on the due date, the tax collector of the taxing district involved shall notify the lessor that the same remains unpaid.  Upon receipt of said notification from the tax collector, the lessor shall terminate said lease or agreement and pay over to the tax collector from amounts received from said lease such sums as are necessary to satisfy the tax due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The exemptions provided in subparagraph (a) shall apply to the lands and the buildings and structures thereon and therein and personal property owned by the university system of New Hampshire or the community college system of New Hampshire.  The requirements of subparagraph (b) shall apply to all leases and other agreements entered into or renewed on or after April 1, 2006, the terms of which provide for the use or occupation by others of real or personal property owned by the university system of New Hampshire or the community college system of New Hampshire.  The remedies set forth in subparagraph (c) shall be available to enforce the payment of real and personal property taxes assessed against the lessees of property owned by the university system of New Hampshire or the community college system of New Hampshire pursuant to this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Lands and buildings and personal property owned and used by any county for governmental purposes, including hospitals, court houses, registry buildings, and county correctional facilities except that county farms and their lands, buildings and taxable personal property shall be taxed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Houses of public worship, parish houses, church parsonages occupied by their pastors, convents, monasteries, buildings and the lands appertaining to them owned, used and occupied directly for religious training or for other religious purposes by any regularly recognized and constituted denomination, creed or sect, organized, incorporated or legally doing business in this state and the personal property used by them for the purposes for which they are established.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The buildings and structures of schools, seminaries of learning, colleges, academies and universities organized, incorporated or legally doing business in this state and owned, used and occupied by them directly for the purposes for which they are established, including but not limited to the dormitories, dining rooms, kitchens, auditoriums, classrooms, infirmaries, administrative and utility rooms and buildings connected therewith, athletic fields and facilities and gymnasiums, boat houses and wharves belonging to them and used in connection therewith, and the land thereto appertaining but not including lands and buildings not used and occupied directly for the purposes for which they are organized or incorporated, and the personal property used by them directly for the purposes for which they are established, provided none of the income or profits are divided among the members or stockholders or used or appropriated for any other purpose than the purpose for which they are organized or established;  provided further that if the value of the dormitories, dining rooms and kitchens shall exceed $150,000, the value thereof in excess of said sum shall be taxable.  A town at an annual town meeting or the governing body of a city may vote to increase the amount of the exemption upon dormitories, dining rooms and kitchens.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The buildings, lands and personal property of charitable organizations and societies organized, incorporated, or legally doing business in this state, owned, used and occupied by them directly for the purposes for which they are established, provided that none of the income or profits thereof is used for any other purpose than the purpose for which they are established.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. The real estate and personal property owned by any organization described in paragraphs I, II, III, IV or V of this section and occupied and used by another organization described in said paragraphs, but only to the extent that such real estate and personal property would be exempt from taxation under said paragraphs if such property were owned by the organization occupying and using the property, as long as any rental fee and repairs, charged by the owner, are not in clear excess of fair rental value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every charitable organization or society, except those religious and educational organizations and societies whose real estate is exempt under the provisions of paragraphs III and IV, shall annually before June 1 file with the municipality in which the property is located upon a form prescribed and provided by the board of tax and land appeals a statement of its financial condition for the preceding fiscal year and such other information as may be necessary to establish its status and eligibility for tax exemption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72:23-l Definition of "Charitable''. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The term "charitable'' as used to describe a corporation, society or other organization within the scope of this chapter, including RSA 72:23 and 72:23-k, shall mean a corporation, society or organization established and administered for the purpose of performing, and obligated, by its charter or otherwise, to perform some service of public good or welfare advancing the spiritual, physical, intellectual, social or economic well-being of the general public or a substantial and indefinite segment of the general public that includes residents of the state of New Hampshire, with no pecuniary profit or benefit to its officers or members, or any restrictions which confine its benefits or services to such officers or members, or those of any related organization.  The fact that an organization's activities are not conducted for profit shall not in itself be sufficient to render the organization "charitable'' for purposes of this chapter, nor shall the organization's treatment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  This section is not intended to abrogate the meaning of "charitable'' under the common law of New Hampshire.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The vote shall specify the provisions of the property tax exemption or credit, the amount of such exemption or credit, and the manner of its determination, as listed in paragraph I.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A municipality may modify, if applicable, or rescind the exemption or credits provided in paragraph I in the manner described in this section.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72:33 Application for Exemption or Tax Credit. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I.

The form shall include the following and such other information deemed necessary by the commissioner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Instructions on completing and filing the form, including an explanation of the grounds for requesting tax exemptions and credits pursuant to RSA 72.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Sections for information concerning the applicant, the property for which the relief is sought, and other properties owned by the person applying.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A section explaining the appeal procedure and stating the appeal deadline in the event the municipality denies the tax relief request in whole or in part.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A place for the applicant's signature with a certification by the person applying that the application has a good faith basis and the facts in the application are true.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. If any person, otherwise qualified to receive an exemption or credit, shall satisfy the selectmen or assessors that he or she was prevented by accident, mistake, or misfortune from filing a permanent application or amended permanent application on or before April 15 of the year in which he or she desires the exemption to begin, said officials may receive the application at a later date and grant an exemption or credit for that year;  but no such application shall be received or exemption or credit granted after the local tax rate has been approved for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who changes residence after filing such a permanent application shall file an amended permanent application on or before December 1 immediately following the change of residence.  The filing of the permanent application shall be sufficient for said persons to receive these exemptions or tax credits on an annual basis so long as the applicant does not change residence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the selectmen or assessors are satisfied that the applicant has willfully made any false statement in the application to obtain an exemption or tax credit, they may refuse to grant the exemption or tax credit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to the above requirements, applicants for exemption who claim ownership pursuant to RSA 72:29, VI shall file with their application an additional statement signed under penalty of perjury, on a form approved and provided by the commissioner of revenue administration, showing they meet the requirements of RSA 72:29, VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The assessing officials may require applicants for any exemption or tax credit to file the information listed in RSA 72:34, or the statement required by RSA 72:33, V periodically but no more frequently than annually.  Failure to file such periodic statements may, at the discretion of the assessing officials, result in a loss of the exemption or tax credit for that year.

<center><h3>Section 72:38-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72:38-a Tax Deferral for Elderly and Disabled. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any resident property owner may apply for a tax deferral if the person:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is either at least 65 years old or eligible under Title II or Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act for benefits for the disabled;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Has owned the homestead for at least 5 consecutive years if the person qualifies as an elderly applicant, or has owned the homestead for at least one year if the person qualifies as a disabled applicant;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Is living in the home.
<br>
The assessing officials may annually grant a person qualified under this paragraph a tax deferral for all or part of the taxes due, plus annual interest at 5 percent, if in their opinion the tax liability causes the taxpayer an undue hardship or possible loss of the property.  The total of tax deferrals on a particular property shall not be more than 85 percent of its equity value.  The total of tax deferrals shall be determined by the following formula:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Assessed Value = Equalized Assessed Value
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Equalization Ratio
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Equalized Assessed Value - Total of Priority Liens = Equity Value
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Equity Value X .85 = Total Amount Which May be Deferred
<br>
At any time during the tax deferral process, the governing body may consider an abatement pursuant to RSA 76:16.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A tax deferral shall be subject to any prior liens on the property and shall be treated as such in any foreclosure proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. No person shall be entitled to the deferral under this section unless the person has filed with the selectmen or assessors, by March 1 following the date of notice of tax under RSA 72:1-d, a permanent application therefor, signed under penalty of perjury, on a form approved and provided by the commissioner of revenue administration, showing that the applicant is the true and lawful owner of the property on which the deferral is claimed and that the applicant is duly qualified at the time of application.  Any person who changes residence after filing such a permanent application shall file an amended permanent application on or before December 1 immediately following the change of residence.  The filing of the permanent application shall be sufficient for said persons to receive a deferral on an annual basis so long as the applicant does not change residence;  provided, however, that towns and cities may require an annual application for the tax deferral authorized for the elderly and disabled by this section.  The form shall include the following and such other information deemed necessary by the commissioner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Instructions on completing and filing the form, including an explanation of the grounds for requesting a deferral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Sections for information concerning the applicant, the property for which the relief is sought, and other properties owned by the person applying.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A section explaining the appeal procedure and stating the appeal deadline in the event the municipality denies the tax relief request in whole or in part.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A place for the applicant's signature with a certification by the person applying that the application has a good faith basis and the facts in the application are true.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the property is subject to a mortgage, the owner must have the mortgage holder's approval of the tax deferral.  Such approval does not grant the town a preferential lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the owner of a property subject to a tax deferral dies, the heirs, heirs-at-law, assignee, or devisee shall have first priority to redeem the estate by paying in full the deferred taxes plus any interest due.  If the heirs, heirs-at-law, assignees, or devisees do not redeem the property within 9 months of the date of death of the property owner, the municipality may commit the accrued amount of the deferral to the collector of taxes with a warrant signed by the assessing officials requiring him or her to collect it;  and the collector of taxes shall have the same rights and remedies in relation thereto as provided in RSA 76:13 and RSA 80.  Prior to holding a tax sale or executing a priority tax lien under RSA 80:59, the collector shall, at least 30 days prior to such tax sale or tax lien execution, send notice by certified or registered mail, to the last known post office address of the current owner, if known, or to the last known address of the deceased taxpayer, and to all mortgagees from whom permission has been sought pursuant to paragraph III of this section.  Any person with a legal interest in the property may redeem it, either prior to the tax sale or tax lien execution, or subsequently as set forth in RSA 80:32 or RSA 80:69.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. When the owner of a property subject to a tax deferral sells or otherwise conveys the property, the owner or grantee shall pay in full the deferred taxes plus any interest due and the municipality shall provide recorded written release or satisfaction of the notice of tax deferral.  If the owner or grantee, who shall be deemed to have notice of and shall take title to the property subject to the notice of tax deferral, does not pay the accrued amount on the property within 9 months of the date of sale or conveyance of the property, the municipality may commit the accrued amount of the deferral to the collector of taxes with a warrant signed by the assessing officials requiring him or her to collect it;  and the collector of taxes shall have the same rights and remedies in relation thereto as provided in RSA 76:13 and RSA 80.  Prior to holding a tax sale or executing a priority tax lien under RSA 80:59, the collector shall, at least 30 days prior to such tax sale or tax lien execution, send notice by certified or registered mail, to the last known post office address of the current owner, if known, or to the last known address of the taxpayer who received the deferral, and to all mortgagees from whom permission has been sought pursuant to paragraph III of this section.  Any person with a legal interest in the property may redeem it, either prior to the tax sale or tax lien execution, or subsequently as set forth in RSA 80:32 or RSA 80:69.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The assessing officials shall file notice of each tax deferral granted, within 30 days, with the registry of deeds of the county in which the property is located to perfect it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When a taxpayer appeals the denial of a deferral application to the superior court or board of tax and land appeals, the court or board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review when there is an error of law or when the court or board is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that said decision is unreasonable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72:38-b Exemption for Deaf or Severely Hearing Impaired Persons;  Procedure for Adoption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any deaf person or person with severe hearing impairment shall be exempt each year on the assessed value, for property tax purposes, of his or her residential real estate to the value of $15,000, and a city or town may exempt any amount it may determine is appropriate to address significant increases in property values in accordance with the procedures in this section.  For residential real estate owned by the spouse of an eligible person, the exemption shall be allowed if they have been married for at least 5 years.  The term "residential real estate'' as used in this section shall mean the same as defined in RSA 72:29.  All applications made under this section shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 72:33 and RSA 72:34.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The exemption in paragraph I applies only to property which is occupied as the principal place of abode by the eligible deaf person or person with severe hearing impairment.  For purposes of this section, "deaf person or person with severe hearing impairment'' means a person who has a 71 Db hearing average hearing loss or greater in the better ear as determined by a licensed audiologist or qualified otolaryngologist, who may rely on a visual means of communication, such as American Sign Language or speech recognition, and whose hearing is so impaired as to substantially limit the person from processing linguistic information through hearing, with or without amplification, so as to require the use of an interpreter or auxiliary aid.  The exemption may be applied to any land or buildings appurtenant to the residence or to manufactured housing if that is the principal place of abode.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No exemption shall be allowed under paragraph I unless the person applying therefor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Has resided in this state for at least 5 consecutive years preceding April 1 in the year in which the exemption is claimed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Had in the calendar year preceding said April 1 a net income from all sources, or if married, a combined net income from all sources, of not more than the respective amount determined by the city or town for purposes of paragraph I.  Under no circumstances shall the amount determined by the city or town be less than $13,400 for a single person or $20,400 for married persons.  The net income shall be determined by deducting from all moneys received, from any source including social security or pension payments, the amount of any of the following or the sum thereof:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Life insurance paid on the death of an insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Expenses and costs incurred in the course of conducting a business enterprise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Proceeds from the sale of assets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Owns net assets not in excess of the amount determined by the city or town for purposes of paragraph I, excluding the value of the person's actual residence and the land upon which it is located up to the greater of 2 acres or the minimum single family residential lot size specified in the local zoning ordinance.  The amount determined by the city or town shall not be less than $35,000 or, if married, combined net assets in such greater amount as may be determined by the town or city.  "Net assets'' means the value of all assets, tangible and intangible, minus the value of any good faith encumbrances.  "Residence'' means the housing unit, and related structures such as an unattached garage or woodshed, which is the person's principal home, and which the person in good faith regards as home to the exclusion of any other places where the person may temporarily live.  "Residence'' shall exclude attached dwelling units and unattached structures used or intended for commercial or other nonresidential purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Additional requirements for an exemption under paragraph I shall be that the property is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Owned by the resident;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Owned by a resident jointly or in common with the resident's spouse, either of whom meets the requirements for the exemption claimed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Owned by a resident jointly or in common with a person not the resident's spouse, if the resident meets the applicable requirements for the exemption claimed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Owned by a resident, or the resident's spouse, either of whom meets the requirements for the exemption claimed, and when they have been married to each other for at least 5 consecutive years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to the exemption provided in this section, a person may claim an exemption for improvements to assist persons who are deaf or severely hearing impaired as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Every owner of residential real estate upon which he or she resides, and to which he or she has made improvements for the purpose of assisting a person who is deaf or severely hearing impaired who also resides on such real estate, is each year entitled to an exemption from the assessed value, for property tax purposes, upon such residential real estate determined by deducting the value of such improvements from the assessed value of the residential real estate before determining the taxes upon such real estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The exemption under this paragraph shall apply only in taxable years during which the person who is deaf or severely hearing impaired resided on the residential real estate for which the exemption is claimed on April 1 in any given year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any town or city may adopt, modify, or rescind the provisions of this section in the manner provided in RSA 72:27-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The vote shall specify the provisions of the exemptions provided in RSA 72:38-b.  The exemption shall take effect in the tax year beginning April 1 following its adoption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A municipality may rescind the exemptions provided by this section in the manner described in paragraph VI.

I. An owner shall apply for the exemption under RSA 72:76 prior to construction, but not after December 31 before the beginning of the tax year for which the exemption is sought.  In such cases the selectmen or assessors may anticipatorily grant the exemption, subject to adjustment when the actual increase in assessed value becomes known.  If construction is partially complete on April 1 of any year, the exemption for that year shall be based on the increased assessed value attributable to the partial construction, but the duration of the exemption shall be adjusted such that the cumulative amount of exemptions received, based on the construction as completed, is proportional to that received by other eligible properties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The selectmen or assessors shall notify the applicant of their decision no later than February 28 before the beginning of the tax year for which the exemption is sought.  The decision shall specify the amount of the exemption, that it is effective with the new tax year and the number of years for which the exemption applies to qualified construction.  The decision of the selectmen or assessors may be appealed in the manner set forth in RSA 72:34-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The selectmen or assessors may request such additional or updated information as is necessary to determine eligibility.  If they are satisfied that the applicant has willfully made any false statement, or has refused to provide information after such a request, they may refuse to grant the exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the municipality completes a revaluation during the period for which an exemption has been granted, the amount of the exemption shall be adjusted by the difference in equalization ratios applicable in the municipality before and after the revaluation.
