&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72:13 Mines, Sand, Gravel, Loam, or Other Similar Substances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Real estate shall be taxed independently of any mines or ores contained therein until such mines or ores shall become a source of profit, and independently of any sand, gravel, loam, or other similar substances contained therein until any of them shall become a source of profit;  except when such mines, ores, sand, gravel, loam, or other similar substances, or rights therein are owned by some person other than the one to whom such real estate is taxed, in which case they shall be taxed as real estate to such other person.  This section shall not apply to real estate containing earth, as that term is defined in RSA 155-E:1, I.  Earth and the real property constituting the area from which earth is being excavated shall be taxed exclusively under RSA 72-B.
