<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A town or city may adopt or modify elderly exemptions by the procedure in RSA 72:27-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An elderly exemption, based on assessed value for qualified taxpayers, may be granted for a different dollar amount determined by the town or city, to a person 65 years of age up to 75 years, to a person 75 years of age up to 80 years, and to a person 80 years of age or older.  To qualify, the person must have been a New Hampshire resident for at least 3 consecutive years, own the real estate individually or jointly, or if the real estate is owned by such person's spouse, they must have been married to each other for at least 5 consecutive years.  In addition, the taxpayer must have a net income in each applicable age group of not more than a dollar amount determined by the town or city of not less than $13,400 or, if married, a combined net income of not more than a dollar amount determined by the town or city of not less than $20,400;  and own net assets not in excess of a dollar amount determined by the town or city of not less than $35,000 excluding the value of the person's residence or, if married, combined net assets not in excess of a dollar amount determined by the town or city of not less than $35,000 excluding the value of the residence.  Under no circumstances shall the amounts of the exemption for any age category be less than $5,000.  The combined net asset amount for married persons shall apply to a surviving spouse until the sale or transfer of the property by the surviving spouse or until the remarriage of the surviving spouse.
