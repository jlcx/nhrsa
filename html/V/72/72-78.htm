&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 72:78 Application for Exemption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An owner shall apply for the exemption under RSA 72:76 prior to construction, but not after December 31 before the beginning of the tax year for which the exemption is sought.  In such cases the selectmen or assessors may anticipatorily grant the exemption, subject to adjustment when the actual increase in assessed value becomes known.  If construction is partially complete on April 1 of any year, the exemption for that year shall be based on the increased assessed value attributable to the partial construction, but the duration of the exemption shall be adjusted such that the cumulative amount of exemptions received, based on the construction as completed, is proportional to that received by other eligible properties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The selectmen or assessors shall notify the applicant of their decision no later than February 28 before the beginning of the tax year for which the exemption is sought.  The decision shall specify the amount of the exemption, that it is effective with the new tax year and the number of years for which the exemption applies to qualified construction.  The decision of the selectmen or assessors may be appealed in the manner set forth in RSA 72:34-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The selectmen or assessors may request such additional or updated information as is necessary to determine eligibility.  If they are satisfied that the applicant has willfully made any false statement, or has refused to provide information after such a request, they may refuse to grant the exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the municipality completes a revaluation during the period for which an exemption has been granted, the amount of the exemption shall be adjusted by the difference in equalization ratios applicable in the municipality before and after the revaluation.
