I. The real estate and personal property of the Senior Citizens Housing Development Corporation of Claremont, Inc., a nonprofit New Hampshire corporation which provides housing for elderly persons, shall, if none of the income or profits is used for any purpose other than the purpose for which such housing was established, be exempt from taxation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. On or before November 1 of each year the owner of the housing project shall enter into an agreement with the municipality in which the property is situated to pay the municipality, on December 1 of each year, a sum in lieu of taxes to defray the costs of municipal, non-utility, services.  Failing mutual agreement, the sum paid on December 1 of each year shall be an amount not to exceed the lower of 10 percent of the shelter rent received by the owner from all sources during the preceding calendar year, not including security deposits received from residents of the housing project, for shelter and care of residents within the project, or a sum equivalent to that derived from the application of the current municipal, non-school, portion of the local tax rate against the net local assessed value of the project.  For cause shown and at any time, keeping in mind the nature and purpose of the project, the municipality or the board of tax and land appeals may refund or abate all or a portion of the payment in lieu of taxes in any year.  The owner shall on or before June 1 of each year file with the municipality in which the property is located, upon a form prescribed and provided by the board of tax and land appeals, a statement of its financial condition for the preceding fiscal year and such other information as the board of tax and land appeals requires.
