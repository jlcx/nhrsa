<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) On or before May 1 of each year the company shall file a form, designated by the commissioner, that details the company's actual financial operating performance, including company income and all expenses, original cost, and depreciated value of all the company's assets, since the prior April 1 of the preceding year.  This statement shall include such additional information as the commissioner shall require and shall be signed by an authorized representative, subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If by May 1 the company is unable to file the form as required under subparagraph (a), the company shall request an extension from the department.  Such extension shall be valid only upon written confirmation from the department, and shall not exceed 30 days per request.  No more than 2 extensions shall be granted in a given tax year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Taxes and estimated taxes not paid when due shall be subject to appropriate penalties and interest under RSA 21-J:32 and RSA 21-J:33.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any company that fails to file a completed form as required under paragraph I on or before May 1, or by the date granted by an extension, if applicable, shall pay a penalty of one percent of the property tax for which the person is liable.  In no case, however, shall the penalty be less than $250 or more than $2,500.  This penalty shall be treated as incident to the tax and shall be in addition to any other penalty applicable pursuant to paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No later than 30 days subsequent to a sale or transfer of a company's property or assets, the company acquiring such property shall notify the department in writing.  Such notice shall include the name and address of the company, the date of the transfer, and all the terms of transaction.
