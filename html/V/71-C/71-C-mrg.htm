<center><h3>Section 71-C:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 71-C:1 Definition.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In this chapter, "tax expenditure'' means a credit or exemption that is intended by the legislature to allow individuals or businesses to reduce the amount owed for state taxes in return for a change in behavior.  A tax expenditure does not include a credit or exemption meant only to avoid double taxation of the same income or assets within the same taxing jurisdiction.  A tax rate reduced for the express purpose of achieving a change in behavior may also be identified by the committee in RSA 71-C:3 as a tax expenditure for the purpose of regular review.

The joint committee shall determine which credits, exemptions, and reduced rates meet the definition of a tax expenditure, recommend legislation to add any additional tax expenditures to RSA 71-C:2, establish a rotating schedule for review over 5-year periods, determine the goals of each tax expenditure, and establish general criteria for the future evaluation of each such tax expenditure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The joint committee shall file an initial report containing its determinations on or before November 1, 2014 with the speaker of the house, the senate president, the governor, and the commissioner of revenue administration.
