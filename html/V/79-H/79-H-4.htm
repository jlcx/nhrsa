<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The assessing officials in any municipality adopting the provisions of this chapter shall appraise qualifying chartered public school facility property at no more than 10 percent of its market value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No owner of land and buildings renting or leasing to a qualifying chartered public school facility shall be entitled to have the property appraised for any tax year under the provisions of this chapter unless the owner applies to the assessing officials on or before April 15 of said year, on a form approved and provided by the commissioner, to have the property so appraised.  Such application shall include a verified copy of the rental or lease agreement containing terms and provisions identifying the specific real property exclusively used by the chartered public school for the purposes of RSA 194-B and payment terms under the rental or lease agreement which assign the tax exemption under this chapter to the benefit of the chartered public school.  If any owner satisfies the assessing officials that it was prevented by accident, mistake, or misfortune from filing such application on or before April 15, the assessing officials may receive the application at a later date and appraise the property under this chapter;  but no such application shall be received after the local tax rate has been approved by the commissioner for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The assessing officials shall notify the applicant on a form provided by the commissioner no later than July 1, or within 15 days if the application is filed after July 1, of their decision to classify or refuse to classify the property under the provisions of this chapter by delivery of such notification to the owner in person or by mailing such notification to the owner's last and usual place of abode.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A list of all qualifying chartered public school facilities assessed under this chapter and their owners in each town or city shall be filed by the respective assessing officials each year.  Such list shall be part of the record and subject to inspection as provided in RSA 76:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner shall include on the inventory blank, required under RSA 74:4, a question concerning whether any changes have been made in the use of a qualifying chartered public school facility.  The question shall be written to enable the assessing officials to locate qualifying facilities which may require a change in assessment and to fit the context of the blank.
