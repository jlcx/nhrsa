&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 78-C:2 Refined Petroleum Products Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tax is hereby imposed upon the refining of refined petroleum products at the uniform rate of  1/10 of one percent on the fair market value per barrel of such products at the refinery site, to be paid by the refiner thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The fair market value per barrel of such refined petroleum products shall be determined by the commissioner, who may, in making such determination, consider the usual selling price of such products at the refinery, the cost of the crude petroleum used, the cost of refining the same, and any other relevant evidence.  Such determination shall be subject to review as provided in RSA 21-J:28-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The number of barrels produced shall be computed by tank tables showing 100 percent of production and exact measurements of contents, or by meters or other measuring devices which accurately determine the volume of production or total products produced.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every person engaged in the production of refined petroleum products during a taxable period shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the first month following the expiration of the taxable period, make a return to the commissioner under such regulations and in such form or manner as the commissioner may prescribe.  Returns shall contain full data as required by the commissioner for correct computation of the tax hereunder.  All returns shall be signed by the taxpayer or by his authorized representative, subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At the same time the return is filed as required by paragraph I, every person who produces refined petroleum products shall, in addition, file a declaration of its estimated production of refined petroleum products and estimated tax thereon for the subsequent taxable period.  Such estimated production of refined petroleum products and estimated tax thereon shall be at least equal to the production and tax on the return filed therewith, unless for good cause the commissioner permits the taxpayer to make a lesser estimate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who fails to file any return or declaration at the time prescribed in this section shall pay at the time the return or declaration is filed, in addition to any tax liability and without assessment or demand, a late filing fee of $100 for each day or fraction thereof which has elapsed between the prescribed filing date and the date of actual filing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 78-C:4 Payment of Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. One-third of the taxpayer's estimated tax on refined petroleum products for the subsequent taxable period is due and payable at the time the taxpayer files the declaration required in RSA 78-C:3, II;   1/3 is due and payable one month thereafter;  and  1/3 is due and payable 2 months thereafter.  If the return required by RSA 78-C:3, I, shows an additional amount to be due, such additional amount is due and payable at the time the return is filed.  If such return shows an overpayment of the tax due, the commissioner shall allow the taxpayer a credit against a subsequent payment or payments due, to the extent of the overpayment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who produces refined petroleum products who fails to make payment when due shall, in addition, pay a late payment charge equal to 10 percent of the defaulted payment plus interest computed at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof from the prescribed payment date to the date payment is actually made.  Such late payment charge and interest shall be in addition to any late filing fee which may be due under the provisions of RSA 78-C:3, III.
