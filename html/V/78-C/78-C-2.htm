&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tax is hereby imposed upon the refining of refined petroleum products at the uniform rate of  1/10 of one percent on the fair market value per barrel of such products at the refinery site, to be paid by the refiner thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The fair market value per barrel of such refined petroleum products shall be determined by the commissioner, who may, in making such determination, consider the usual selling price of such products at the refinery, the cost of the crude petroleum used, the cost of refining the same, and any other relevant evidence.  Such determination shall be subject to review as provided in RSA 21-J:28-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
