&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-C:6 Additional Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the commissioner has reason to believe that a nursing facility has failed to file a return or to include any part of its net patient services revenue in a filed return, the commissioner may require the nursing facility to file a return or a supplementary return showing such additional information as the commissioner prescribes.  Upon the receipt of the supplementary return, or if none is received within the time set by the commissioner, the commissioner may find and assess the amount due upon the information that is available.  The making of such additional return does not relieve the nursing facility of any penalty for failure to make a correct original return or relieve it from liability for interest imposed under RSA 21-J:28 or any other additional charges imposed by the commissioner.  This section shall not be construed to modify the statute of limitations provided in RSA 21-J:29.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-C:7 Extension of Time for Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
For good cause, the commissioner may extend the time within which a nursing facility is required to file a return, and if such return is filed during the period of extension no penalty or late filing charge may be imposed for failure to file the return at the time required by this chapter, but the nursing facility shall be liable for interest and late payment charges as prescribed in RSA 21-J:28 or RSA 21-J:33.  Failure to file the return during the period of the extension shall void the extension.
