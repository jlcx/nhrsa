&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 83-E:4 Liability for Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph III, every consumer shall be liable for the tax and such liability shall not be extinguished until the tax has been paid to the state, except that payment to a provider required to collect the tax pursuant to RSA 83-E:3 is sufficient to relieve the consumer from further liability for the tax.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any tax required to be collected, and any tax received by a provider, shall become a personal debt of the provider until paid to the state. The provider shall be relieved of further liability for such taxes in the event that the tax is paid directly to the state by the consumer or another person.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Consumers, who are customers of the Town of Ashland Electric Department, Littleton Water and Light Department, New Hampton Village Precinct Electric Department, Wolfeboro Municipal Electric Department, Woodsville Water and Light Department, or any other municipalized provider established on or after the effective date of this chapter, shall be exempt from taxation under this chapter, as long as distribution remains within municipal boundaries.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in this section, on or before the fifteenth day of each second month following a taxable month, each provider maintaining a place of business or having transmission or distribution property in this state shall make a return to the department for the taxable month on a form prescribed by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any provider who has applied for and been granted permission to remit taxes annually shall file a return for each calendar year on or before February 15 of the following calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any provider who ceases to engage in distributing, redistributing, or transmitting electrical energy for consumption, and is thereby not responsible for filing returns under this chapter, shall file a final return with the department not more than one month after discontinuing such activity. This requirement shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter regarding the time within which to file a return.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In making a return, providers shall determine the value of any non-monetary consideration received by them and shall include such value in their return. Such determination shall be subject to review and revision by the department in the manner provided in this chapter for the correction of returns.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the commissioner finds that the information required for the making of an accurate return cannot reasonably be compiled by a provider within one month and 15 days after the close of the taxable month for which a return is to be made, the commissioner may grant an extension of time for the filing of such return. Any such extension shall be granted for a period not to exceed 31 calendar days. The granting of such extension may be conditioned upon the payment by the provider of an amount of money equal to the amount estimated by the commissioner to be due with the return when filed under extension. All such estimated payments shall be credited against the provider's liabilities under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The provider shall pay to the department the amount of tax imposed by this chapter at the time it makes a return.

<center><h3>Section 83-E:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 83-E:8 Additional Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the commissioner has reason to believe that a provider has failed to file a return or to include any part of the total kilowatt hours distributed, redistributed, or transmitted by such provider for consumption in this state in a filed return, the commissioner may require the provider to file a return or a supplementary return showing such additional information as the commissioner prescribes. Upon the receipt of the supplementary return, or if none is received within the time set by the commissioner, the commissioner may find and assess the amount due upon the information that is available. The making of such additional return does not relieve the provider of any penalty for failure to make a correct original return, or relieve it from liability for interest imposed under RSA 21-J:28 or for any other additional charges imposed by the commissioner. This section shall not be construed to modify or extend the statute of limitations provided in RSA 21-J:29.
