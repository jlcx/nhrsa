&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-A:15 Severability.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable.  This severability clause shall apply to the application of this chapter to revenue from inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services, such that the invalidity of either shall not affect the application of the statute to the other.
