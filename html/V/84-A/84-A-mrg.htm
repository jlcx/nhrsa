&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 84-A:6 Additional Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When the commissioner has reason to believe that a hospital has failed to file a return or to include any part of its net patient services revenue in a filed return, the commissioner may require the hospital to file a return or a supplementary return showing such additional information as the commissioner prescribes.  Upon the receipt of the supplementary return, or if none is received within the time set by the commissioner, the commissioner may find and assess the amount due upon the information that is available.  The making of such additional return does not relieve the hospital of any penalty for failure to make a correct original return or relieve it from liability for interest imposed under RSA 21-J:28 or any other additional charges imposed by the commissioner.  This section shall not be construed to modify the statute of limitations provided in RSA 21-J:29.

For good cause, the commissioner may extend the time within which a hospital is required to file a return, and if such return is filed during the period of extension no penalty or late filing charge may be imposed for failure to file the return at the time required by this chapter, but the hospital shall be liable for interest and late payment charges as prescribed in RSA 21-J:28 or 33.  Failure to file the return during the period of the extension shall void the extension.

It is the declared intent of this chapter to provide for the consistent, equitable, and rational taxation of revenue received from inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services, which are 2 separate and distinct classes of property and are permissible classes of health care-related services which may be taxed in accordance with federal law to ensure access to Federal Financial Participation.  In addition, it is the declared intent of this chapter to enact a health care-related tax, as permitted under section 1903(w) of the Social Security Act, upon the revenue derived from inpatient and outpatient hospital services, which are distinct from other classes of health care services, are subject to a different reimbursement methodology for public payors, are subject to different licensing and certification requirements, are potentially eligible for uncompensated care payments under the disproportionate share hospital program, and which provide a necessary, rational, and demonstrated public health benefit.

This severability clause shall apply to the application of this chapter to revenue from inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services, such that the invalidity of either shall not affect the application of the statute to the other.
