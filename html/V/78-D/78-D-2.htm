II. No retailer shall provide to a foreign state any private customer information for use in the determination of sales or use tax liability of the customer in the foreign state or for use in the determination, collection, and remittance of sales or use tax by the retailer with respect to a New Hampshire retail purchase transaction, unless the foreign state has first provided to the retailer written confirmation that the foreign state provided prior written notice of its intent to collect a use tax on such retail transaction to the commissioner of revenue administration, and no later than 60 days following the commissioner's receipt of such notice by the foreign state, the department of justice has submitted to the commissioner its determination that the foreign state's sales and use tax statutes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(d) Require every resident to submit annually to the foreign state a statement (i) identifying each and every item subject to such foreign state's sales and use tax purchased outside such foreign state for storage, use or consumption within such foreign state during an applicable period, (ii) stating the value of such items purchased, and (iii) including a statement under penalties of perjury that such resident complied with the requirement stated in this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Require its residents or the foreign state to provide the retailer at the time of a New Hampshire retail purchase transaction with information establishing whether or not the goods or services purchased in the state are intended to be used, stored, or consumed within the foreign state, and provide that any information supplied by its residents is irrefutably presumed to be correct and complete, and that the retailer may rely on such information regardless of the accuracy or completeness of such information;
