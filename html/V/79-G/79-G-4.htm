<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The assessing officials in any municipality adopting the provisions of this chapter shall appraise qualifying historic buildings and the land appurtenant thereto at no more than 10 percent of their market value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No owner of a qualifying historic building shall be entitled to have the property appraised for any tax year under the provisions of this chapter unless the owner applies to the assessing officials on or before April 15 of said year, on a form approved and provided by the commissioner, to have the property so appraised.  If any owner satisfies the assessing officials that it was prevented by accident, mistake, or misfortune from filing such application on or before April 15, the assessing officials may receive the application at a later date and appraise the property under this chapter;  but no such application shall be received after the local tax rate has been approved by the commissioner for that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The assessing officials shall notify the applicant on a form provided by the commissioner no later than July 1, or within 15 days if the application is filed after July 1, of their decision to classify or refusal to classify the property under the provisions of this chapter by delivery of such notification to the owner in person or by mailing such notification to the owner's last and usual place of abode.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A list of all qualifying historic buildings assessed under this chapter and their owners in each town or city shall be filed by the respective assessing officials each year.  Such list shall be part of the invoice and subject to inspection as provided in RSA 76:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner shall include on the inventory blank, required under RSA 74:4, a question concerning whether any changes have been made in the use of qualifying historic buildings.  The question shall be written to enable the assessing officials to locate qualifying historic buildings and land appurtenant thereto which may require a change in assessment and to fit the context of the blank.
