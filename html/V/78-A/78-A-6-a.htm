<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The gratuity exceeds the percentage specified in subparagraph (c) and the amount is not separately stated, the exception from tax shall be limited to the percentage enumerated and the additional gratuity shall be subject to tax;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The payroll or other business records of the operator substantiate the distribution of the gratuity to the service employees as a payment that does not supplement wages or is not in lieu of wages.
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any auxiliary charges, not including gratuity charges, such as, but not limited to, service charges, house charges, management fees, or housekeeping charges, added to the charge for a taxable meal or taxable room, shall not be taxed under this chapter if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

VII. The portion of a single aggregate charge allocated to items which are not customarily associated with the purchase of a taxable room or taxable meal, including but not limited to ski lift tickets, boat ride fees, amusement park admission tickets, theater tickets, or other similarly packaged items shall not be taxable if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The packaged item or service is not part of the operator's standard room rental or meal and the allocated cost of the package item or service is equal to the amount paid to an outside vendor or the allocated cost of the package item or service is the amount over and above the amount which a consumer would be ordinarily charged for the room rental and/or meal had the consumer purchased the room or meal without the packaged item or service;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The allocated cost of the package for gratuities meets the requirements of RSA 78-A:6-a, II;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
