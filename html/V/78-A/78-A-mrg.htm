<center><h3>Section 78-A:7</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 78-A:7 Collection of Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The operator shall either state the amount of the tax to each occupant, purchaser of a meal, or renter, or state that the tax is included in the price of the occupancy, meal, or gross rental receipts received.  If the amount of the gratuity is not separately stated, the purchaser's or occupant's contract or receipt shall include the following language:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"The 9 percent tax on meals and rooms is included for the costs of meals and lodging only.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The operator shall demand and collect the tax from the occupant, purchaser, or renter.  The occupant, purchaser, or renter shall pay the tax to the operator.  If the tax is included in the price of the meal, occupancy, or gross rental receipts received, upon request the operator shall state to the purchaser, occupant, or renter the amount of the tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each operator shall keep books and records in a form acceptable to the department showing the amount of all taxes collected.  The operator shall pay the taxes over to the state as provided in this section.  If the department believes that special action is necessary because payment of taxes collected may be in jeopardy, it may direct an operator to keep all taxes collected separate from any other funds.  The department may require that the taxes be periodically deposited in a bank designated by the department, in an account in the name of the department.  The department may withdraw these tax collections from the bank account and apply them to the payment of the taxes due from the operator.  When an operator commingles tax money with money belonging to him, the claim of the state for the tax is traceable, is enforceable against all other claims and takes precedence over all other claims against the commingled funds.  No taxes collected by an operator under this chapter may be sent outside the state without the written consent of the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To compensate operators for keeping the prescribed records and the proper account and remitting of taxes by them, operators are allowed to retain 3 percent of the taxes due and to be remitted if the return and payment are timely received by the department of revenue administration, as provided in RSA 78-A:8, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In lieu of keeping detailed records of taxes collected, and in lieu of payment of the taxes collected under this chapter, an operator may, in writing, elect to compute the amount of taxes due at 9 percent of the total taxable rent, charge for meals, or gross rental receipts received by it, or both, exclusive of the taxes collected on such rents, charges, and gross rental receipts.  If this election is made, the operator may not change the method of computing taxes without the written consent of the department.  Any balance of the tax remaining in possession of the operator may be retained by it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 78-A:8 Returns and Payment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every operator shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month following the collection of taxes imposed by this chapter, file a return reporting the results of the preceding month to the commissioner of revenue administration.  This return shall be filed even though no tax may be due.  Returns may be filed by mail or through electronic data submission.  If such operator has been granted permission to make other than monthly filings, as provided in RSA 78-A:9, II(b), the operator shall make a return in accordance with the return schedule permitted by the department of revenue administration, even though no tax may be due.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the form of such return and the data which it shall contain.  All electronically filed returns shall contain an electronic authorization by the operator or an authorized representative subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, relative to the method of electronic authorization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The taxes collected by every operator shall be paid to the state on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month following their collection.  The operator may deduct from the taxes collected the compensation allowed by RSA 78-A:7, III, and remit the net taxes by electronic funds transfer to the commissioner of revenue administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, returns and remittances due under this chapter shall be considered timely only if received by the department of revenue administration on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month in which they were due.  If this due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the returns and remittances due under this chapter shall be filed no later than the next business day.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An operator shall receive notification of a successful filing and a confirmation number which shall serve as proof of filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any operator that does not choose to file electronically shall forfeit any amounts retained pursuant to RSA 78-A:7, III to the department to offset the costs of manual paper filing.  The forfeiture shall be waived for any business with under $25,000 in meals and rooms taxable revenue in the prior calendar year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 78-A:8-b Surety Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When the commissioner or his designee, in his discretion, deems it necessary to protect the revenues to be obtained under this chapter, he may, after notice and hearing, require any operator required to collect the tax imposed by RSA 78-A:6 to file with him a bond issued by a surety company authorized by the New Hampshire insurance department to do business in this state, in an amount fixed by the commissioner or his designee, to secure the payment of any tax, interest or penalties due, or which may become due.  Surety bonds may be required in situations such as, but not limited to, failure to file returns, failure to make payments with returns at the time required by law, tender by an operator of checks returned for insufficient funds, failure to pay interest and penalties assessed, operators who are itinerant, transient, or temporary, and any other situation which, in the discretion of the commissioner or his designee, renders the collection of the tax in jeopardy.  If, after a hearing, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee issues an order requiring an operator to file a surety bond with the department, the operator shall file such bond within 10 days of the issuance of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The surety on such bond shall be discharged from the liability accruing on the bond after the expiration of 60 days from the date on which the surety shall have lodged with the department a written request to be so discharged;  but such request shall not discharge such surety from any liability already accrued or which shall accrue before the expiration of said 60-day period.  The duration of surety bonds shall be for one year only, unless the requirement is cancelled or revised by the commissioner or his designee before the expiration of the one-year period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In lieu of a bond, cash in an amount prescribed by the commissioner or his designee may be deposited with the state treasurer who may, at any time, upon instructions from the commissioner or his designee and without notice to the depositor, apply the cash deposited to any tax or interest or penalties due.  Cash deposited in lieu of a surety bond shall not earn interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall result in the suspension of the operator's license, as provided in RSA 78-A:5.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If any operator fails to make a return as required by this chapter, the department may make an estimate of the tax liability of the operator from any information it may obtain, and according to such estimate so made by the department, may assess the taxes, interest, and penalty due the state from the operator, may give notice of the assessment to the operator, and may make demand upon him for payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After a return is filed under this chapter, the department shall examine the return and may make such further audits or investigation as it considers necessary.  If it determines that there is a deficiency with respect to the payment of any tax due under this chapter, it shall assess the taxes and interest due the state, give notice of the assessment to the person liable and make demand upon him for payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the department finds that an operator liable for a tax designs to leave the state, or to remove his property from the state, or to conceal himself or his property, or to discontinue business, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partially ineffective proceedings to collect the tax, unless proceedings be brought without delay, the department may immediately assess the tax, interest and penalties due the state and give notice of the assessment and the finding to the operator liable, together with a demand for immediate report or immediate payment, or both, of the tax declared to be in jeopardy, including interest and penalties.  The department may make the estimate of the tax liability from any information it may obtain.  The assessment is presumed to be correct, the burden of showing otherwise being on the operator.  The tax, interest and penalties shall become due and payable at the time the demand for payment is made.  The attorney general may at the same time, without delay, bring suit for the collection of the tax.
