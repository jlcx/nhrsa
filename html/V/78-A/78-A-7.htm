&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 78-A:7 Collection of Tax. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The operator shall either state the amount of the tax to each occupant, purchaser of a meal, or renter, or state that the tax is included in the price of the occupancy, meal, or gross rental receipts received.  If the amount of the gratuity is not separately stated, the purchaser's or occupant's contract or receipt shall include the following language:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"The 9 percent tax on meals and rooms is included for the costs of meals and lodging only.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The operator shall demand and collect the tax from the occupant, purchaser, or renter.  The occupant, purchaser, or renter shall pay the tax to the operator.  If the tax is included in the price of the meal, occupancy, or gross rental receipts received, upon request the operator shall state to the purchaser, occupant, or renter the amount of the tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each operator shall keep books and records in a form acceptable to the department showing the amount of all taxes collected.  The operator shall pay the taxes over to the state as provided in this section.  If the department believes that special action is necessary because payment of taxes collected may be in jeopardy, it may direct an operator to keep all taxes collected separate from any other funds.  The department may require that the taxes be periodically deposited in a bank designated by the department, in an account in the name of the department.  The department may withdraw these tax collections from the bank account and apply them to the payment of the taxes due from the operator.  When an operator commingles tax money with money belonging to him, the claim of the state for the tax is traceable, is enforceable against all other claims and takes precedence over all other claims against the commingled funds.  No taxes collected by an operator under this chapter may be sent outside the state without the written consent of the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To compensate operators for keeping the prescribed records and the proper account and remitting of taxes by them, operators are allowed to retain 3 percent of the taxes due and to be remitted if the return and payment are timely received by the department of revenue administration, as provided in RSA 78-A:8, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In lieu of keeping detailed records of taxes collected, and in lieu of payment of the taxes collected under this chapter, an operator may, in writing, elect to compute the amount of taxes due at 9 percent of the total taxable rent, charge for meals, or gross rental receipts received by it, or both, exclusive of the taxes collected on such rents, charges, and gross rental receipts.  If this election is made, the operator may not change the method of computing taxes without the written consent of the department.  Any balance of the tax remaining in possession of the operator may be retained by it.
