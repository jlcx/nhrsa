&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every business organization having gross business income in excess of $50,000 as defined by RSA 77-A:1, VI, during the taxable period, shall on or before the fifteenth day of the third month in the case of organizations required to file a United States partnership tax return, and the fifteenth day of the fourth month in the case of all other business organizations, following expiration of its taxable period, make a return to the commissioner.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the form of such return and the data which it must contain for the correct computation of taxable business profits and gross business income attributable to this state and the tax assessed on it.  All returns shall be signed by the taxpayer or by its authorized representative, subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Every business organization realizing a gain or loss on the sale or exchange of an interest in the business organization shall file a return for the taxable period, regardless of whether or not the business organization's gross business income is in excess of $50,000 during the taxable period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every business organization shall in addition file a declaration of its estimated business profits tax for its subsequent taxable period;  provided, however, if the estimated tax is less than $200, a declaration need not be filed;  and provided further that a declaration shall be filed at the end of any quarter thereafter in which estimated tax exceeds $200.  The declaration shall be filed when payments are due under RSA 77-A:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A business organization which is part of a water's edge combined group and required to report under this chapter shall file a return containing the combined net income of the water's edge combined group and such other informational returns as the commissioner shall require by rules adopted under RSA 541-A.  The commissioner is authorized to impose the tax as though the entire combined net income of the water's edge combined group was that of one business organization or the commissioner may adjust the tax or income in such other manner as the commissioner shall determine to be equitable if the commissioner determines it to be necessary in order to clearly reflect the net income earned by such organization from business done in this state.  This provision shall not authorize the application of worldwide combined reporting except as provided in RSA 77-A:2-b, II.
