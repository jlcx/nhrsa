Trusts treated as grantor trusts under section 671 of the United States Internal Revenue Code shall be included in the return of their owners, and such owners shall be subject to the tax thereon to the extent such owners would be considered a business organization hereunder notwithstanding the existence of the trust.  The use of consolidated returns as defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code as defined in RSA 77-A:1, XX is not permitted.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, an enterprise shall not be characterized as a business organization and shall be excluded from taxation at the entity level if it elects to be treated as a qualified investment company as defined in RSA 77-A:1, XXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 77-A:3 Apportionment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A business organization which derives gross business profits from business activity both within and without this state, and which is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, or a capital stock tax in another state or is subject to the jurisdiction of another state to impose a net income tax or capital stock tax upon it, whether or not such tax is actually imposed, shall apportion its gross business profits so as to allocate to this state a fair and equitable proportion of such business profits.  Except as provided in this section, such apportionment shall be made on the basis of the following 3 factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The percentage of value of the total real and tangible personal property owned, rented and employed by the business organization everywhere as is owned, rented and employed by it in the operation of its business in this state.  Property owned by the business organization shall be valued at its original cost.  Property rented by the business organization shall be valued at 8 times the net annual rental rate.  Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the business organization less any annual rental rate received by the business organization from subrentals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The percentage of total compensation paid by the business organization to employees everywhere as is paid by the business organization to employees for services rendered within this state.  Such compensation is deemed to be disbursed for services in this state if the service is performed entirely within this state, or if the service is performed both within and without this state and the service performed without this state is incidental to the service within this state, or some of the service is performed in this state and (1) the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in this state, or (2) the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual performing such service resides within this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The percentage of the total sales, including charges for services, made by the business organization everywhere as is made by it within this state.  Sales of tangible personal property are made in this state if the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States government, within this state regardless of f.o.b. point or other conditions of sale, or the property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory or other place of storage in this state and (1) the purchaser is the United States government, or (2) the business organization is not taxable in the state of the purchaser.  Sales other than sales of tangible personal property are in this state if the income-producing activity is performed in this state, or the income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A fraction, the numerator of which shall be the property factor in subparagraph I(a) plus the compensation factor in subparagraph I(b) plus 2 multiplied by the sales factor in subparagraph I(c) and the denominator of which is 4, shall be applied to the total gross business profits (less foreign dividends) of the business organization to ascertain its gross business profits in this state.  If this method of apportionment does not fairly represent the business organization's business activity in this state, the business organization may petition for, or the commissioner may require, in respect to all or any part of the business organization's business activity, if reasonable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The exclusion of any one or more of the apportionment factors;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The inclusion of one or more additional apportionment factors which will fairly represent the business organization's business activity in the state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The employment of any other method to effect an equitable apportionment of the business organization's gross business profits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For foreign dividends from unitary sources, the following formula shall be used to modify factors relating to included dividends:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Determine a percentage for each dividend payor consisting of dividends paid divided by taxable income which has been computed using United States standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 77-A:4 Additions and Deductions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following adjustments shall be made to gross business profits in determining taxable business profits:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of a business organization which is subject to taxation under RSA 77, a deduction of such amount of gross business profits as is attributable to income which is taxable or is specifically exempted from taxation under RSA 77.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A deduction of such amount of gross business profits as is attributable to income derived from interest on notes, bonds or other securities of the United States.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) In the case of a proprietorship, partnership, or limited liability company filing a business profits tax return as a proprietorship or partnership, a deduction equal to a fair and reasonable compensation for the actual personal services of a natural person who is a proprietor, partner, or member provided to the business organization;  provided, however, that the amount of such deduction shall not reduce such business organization's taxable business profits to less than zero.  The purpose of this paragraph is to permit a deduction from gross business profits of such a proprietorship, partnership, or limited liability company of all amounts that are fairly attributable to the actual personal services of the proprietor, partner, or member.  Such amounts shall not exceed the amount reported as earned income on the federal income tax returns of the proprietor, partner, or member, but may also include an amount not to exceed net rental income as compensation for operating rental property, and an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the gross selling price as commissions on the sale of business assets.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (c) which establishes a record-keeping safe harbor, the method of determining the amount of the deduction available to the business organization allowed under this paragraph shall be by using the standards set forth in section 162(a)(1) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, as it may be amended from time to time, and the Treasury Regulations, administrative rulings, and judicial cases issued thereunder.  The business organization shall keep such records as may be necessary to determine that the deduction is reasonable under these standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In lieu of substantiating the value of the personal services of proprietors, partners, or members, a business organization or group of related business organizations may elect, as a record-keeping safe harbor, to deduct up to $50,000 as total compensation for the tax year;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) In this paragraph, "record-keeping safe harbor'' means that amount of compensation for personal services claimed by a business organization which does not need to be substantiated by any evidence, records, or legal or regulatory authority, except as provided in subparagraph (e).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph III(d)(1), the record-keeping safe harbor shall not be relevant or admissible for any purpose in determining whether a compensation deduction claimed in an amount in excess of any such record-keeping safe harbor is fair and reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A business organization or group of related business organizations may elect the record-keeping safe harbor option in subparagraph III(c) without a redetermination of the reasonableness of the deduction by the commissioner.  Any such deduction claimed by the business organization or group of related business organizations shall not be subject to challenge;  provided, that upon request, the business organization or group of related business organizations shall be required to substantiate that the proprietor or at least one partner or member performed actual personal services for the business organization or group of related business organizations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Related business organizations electing not to substantiate the extent of the actual personal services of their proprietors, partners, and members, shall be limited to the record-keeping safe harbor deduction, less any owners' compensation taken on the federal tax returns of corporate members of the group, allocated among the related business organizations.  For the purposes of RSA 77-A:4, III, "related business organizations'' are unitary business organizations and business organizations that would qualify as unitary but for the fact that they conduct business only within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A business organization claiming a deduction under this paragraph shall bear the burden of proving that all proprietors, partners, or members for whom a deduction is being claimed provided actual personal services to the business organization at any time during the taxable period.  Once a business organization has satisfied this burden of proof, the amount claimed as a deduction shall be presumed to be reasonable, unless the commissioner proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the deduction claimed by the business organization is clearly unreasonable.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In the case of a corporation, having adopted a plan of liquidation subsequent to June 30, 1981, which has a nonrecognized gain as a result of the application of the United States Internal Revenue Code (1954) section 337, as amended, or meets the exception requirements allowing the federal nonrecognition provisions of section 337 as provided in section 633 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, an addition to gross business profits for the amount of such gain.

(b) Deducting from gross business profits an amount equal to the sum of the taxpayer's basis in the contributed property plus 50 percent of the unrealized appreciation, or twice the basis of the property, whichever is less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. A deduction for the amount of the net operating loss carryover determined under section 172 of the United States Internal Revenue Code in effect on December 31, 1996.  A net operating loss shall be apportioned in the year incurred according to RSA 77-A:3.  Net operating losses may only be carried forward for the 10 years following the loss year.  For taxable periods ending:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) On or before June 30, 2003, the amount of net operating loss generated in a tax year that may be carried forward may not exceed $250,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) On or after July 1, 2003 and on or before June 30, 2004, the amount of net operating loss generated in a tax year that may be carried forward may not exceed $500,000.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In the case of a business organization not qualifying for treatment as a subchapter C corporation under the United States Internal Revenue Code, such deduction shall be the amount that would be determined under section 172 of the United States Internal Revenue Code in effect on December 31, 1996 if the business organization were a subchapter C corporation and as limited by this section.  A deduction for the amount of the net operating loss carryover shall be limited to losses incurred on or after July 1, 1997.
