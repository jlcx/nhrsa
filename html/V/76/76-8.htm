In determining the tax base, the value of any utility property that is included in the total equalized valuation upon which the statewide education property tax is computed, and is also taxable under RSA 83-F for that year, shall also be subtracted from the tax base, provided the sum value of the utility property represents at least 5 percent of the total equalized value of all property, except property taxable under RSA 82 or RSA 83-F in the preceding year.
