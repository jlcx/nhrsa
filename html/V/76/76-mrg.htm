<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The commissioner shall annually determine a municipality's tax base for the education tax by subtracting from the total equalized valuation of all property, as determined under RSA 21-J:3, XIII for the preceding year, property that was then taxable under RSA 82 and RSA 83-F.  In determining the tax base, the value of any utility property that is included in the total equalized valuation upon which the statewide education property tax is computed, and is also taxable under RSA 83-F for that year, shall also be subtracted from the tax base, provided the sum value of the utility property represents at least 5 percent of the total equalized value of all property, except property taxable under RSA 82 or RSA 83-F in the preceding year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner shall calculate the portion of the education tax to be raised by each municipality by multiplying the uniform education property tax rate by the municipality's tax base.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall issue a warrant under the commissioner's hand and official seal for the amount computed in paragraph I to the selectmen or assessors of each municipality by December 15 directing them to assess such sum and pay it to the municipality for the use of the school district or districts.  Such sums shall be assessed at such times as may be prescribed for other taxes assessed by such selectmen or assessors of the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Municipalities are authorized to assess local property taxes necessary to fund school district appropriations not funded by the education tax, by distributions from the education trust fund under RSA 198:39, or by other revenue sources.

I. A list of all property taxes by them assessed shall be made by the selectmen under their hands, with a warrant under their hands and seal.  The list shall be directed to the collector of such town, requiring the collector to collect the same, and to pay to the town treasurer such sums and at such times as may be therein prescribed.

If a correction cannot be made to generate a warrant with less than  1/2 of one percent discrepancy, the assessing officials shall submit a revised property summary inventory of valuation form as required under RSA 21-J:34, I, for recalculation of the tax rate by the commissioner of revenue administration.  The municipality shall not issue property tax bills until such discrepancy is resolved.

If it later appears that such jeopardy tax payment was in excess of the taxes due the over plus together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the time of payment to the time of refund shall be refunded to the person from whom the tax was collected.  If such tax payment was insufficient to pay the actual tax later found to be due, then a further assessment may be made and may be collected in the same manner as the original assessment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 76:11 Delivery of List;  Notice to Taxpayer;  Other Bills. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Such list shall be delivered to the collector within 30 days from the receipt of information by the selectmen from the commissioner of revenue administration of the rate percent of taxation as provided in RSA 41:15, unless for good cause the time is extended by the commissioner of revenue administration.  The collector shall, within 30 days after the receipt of such list, send to every person taxed, a bill for such taxes by first class mail or, with the approval of the governing body, by electronic means as provided in paragraph II, unless for good cause the time is extended by the commissioner of revenue administration.  Said bill shall be mailed separately and not included with mailing of other town or city bills, unless the governing body of the town or city votes to mail other town or city bills or information directly related to municipal business along with the tax bill.  Under no circumstances shall a city or town mail statements of position on matters of public policy along with the tax bill.  Upon written request of a mortgagee or its representative, the tax collector of a city or town shall mail or transfer by electronic means as provided in paragraph II a duplicate copy of the property tax bill, as it was sent to the property taxpayer, to the party making such request.  Other form of notification of tax owed, acceptable to the mortgagee and the tax collector, may be substituted for the duplicate tax bill.  A separate written request, with specific property identification, shall be required for each duplicate copy or form.  The governing body of a city or town may establish a reasonable fee to be charged for each duplicate copy or form.  Resident tax bills may be included with property tax bills when the inclusion of such resident tax bills will not unduly delay the mailing of either the resident or property tax bills.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The collector may issue bills or notices by electronic means only after the taxpayer requests such delivery.  There shall be no charge for delivery of bills or notices by electronic means and there shall be no penalty for not choosing to elect delivery by electronic means.  Any request for electronic delivery of tax bills or notices shall contain the physical signature of the taxpayer or an electronic signature conforming to the requirements of the federal Electronic Signatures Act or its successor.  Any agreement executed by a taxpayer to receive tax bills by electronic means shall contain a description of the delivery system proposed to be used and shall contain clear instructions on the method for terminating such delivery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event that the collector has any reason to believe that bills or notices sent by electronic means have failed to be delivered, the collector shall promptly send a duplicate of the bills or notices by first class mail.  A duplicate bill or notice mailed in compliance shall be at no cost to the taxpayer.  Second and subsequent notices of payments due, or notices of tax delinquency shall be sent by first class mail.  Sending a bill as provided in this paragraph shall not change the last date that taxes may be paid without penalty.

I. The tax bill which is sent to every person taxed, as provided in RSA 76:11, shall show the rate for municipal, local education, state education, and county taxes separately, the assessed valuation of all lands and buildings for which said person is being taxed, and the right to apply in writing to the selectmen or assessors for an abatement of the tax assessed as provided under RSA 76:16.  The department of revenue administration shall compute for each town and city the rates which are to appear on the tax bills and shall furnish the required information to the appropriate town or city.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The tax bill shall also contain a statement informing the taxpayer of the types of tax relief for which the taxpayer has the right to apply.  The following statement shall be considered adequate:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"If you are elderly, disabled, blind, a veteran, or veteran's spouse, or are unable to pay taxes due to poverty or other good cause, you may be eligible for a tax exemption, credit, abatement, or deferral.  For details and application information, contact (insert title of local assessing officials or office to which application should be made).''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This statement shall be prominent and legible, and may either be printed on the tax bill itself, or on a separate sheet of paper enclosed with the tax bill.  A municipality may in its discretion choose to include more detailed information about the eligibility criteria for different forms of tax relief, provided, however, that the information in the above statement shall be considered a minimum.
<br>

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Taxes shall be collected in the following manner in towns and cities which adopt the provisions of this section in the manner set out in RSA 76:15-b.  A partial payment of the taxes assessed on April 1 in any tax year shall be computed by taking the prior year's assessed valuation times  1/2 of the previous year's tax rate;  provided, however, that whenever it shall appear to the selectmen or assessors that certain individual properties have physically changed in valuation, they may use the current year's appraisal times  1/2 the previous year's tax rate to compute the partial payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, the lists of assessed property shall be committed by the selectmen with a warrant under their hands and seal directed to the collector of such town no later than May 15.  The collector shall mail all the bills for this partial payment no later than June 15.  Partial payment of taxes assessed under this section shall be due and payable on July 1.  The collector shall receive such payments, give a receipt therefor, and credit the amount paid toward the amount of the taxes eventually assessed against the property, in the same manner as prepayments under RSA 80:52-a.  A payment of the remainder of the taxes assessed April 1, minus the payment due on July 1 of that year, shall be due and payable December 1.  Interest charged on all taxes not paid on or before the date they are due shall be as prescribed in RSA 76:13, except that, when bills for the partial payment under this section are mailed on or after June 1, interest shall not be charged until 30 days after the last bill is mailed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 76:15-aa Quarterly Billing of Taxes in Certain Towns and Cities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any city or town which has adopted an optional fiscal year may adopt a system for quarterly billing and collection of taxes as provided in RSA 76:15-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In a city or town that adopts the provisions of RSA 76:15-b, III, the first quarterly bill shall be due and payable (a) in a city or town that has adopted a charter under RSA 49-C or RSA 49-D, on April 1, or (b) in a town other than a town that has adopted a charter under RSA 49-D, on a date determined by the governing body not sooner than 30 days and not later than 45 days following the date of town meeting, during the 6-month conversion period prior to the fiscal year beginning on July 1.  This bill shall be an amount based on  1/4 of the total previous year's complete city or town, school, and county levy.  The entire amount collected on the first quarterly billing date, except for the county portion, shall be credited to the city or town to fund the 6-month conversion period budget as adopted by the legislative body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For the purposes of RSA 80:19, the assessment date for the tax bills due and payable on April 1 of the year of conversion to quarterly tax billing shall be that same date of April 1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Thereafter, beginning with the newly adopted fiscal year beginning July 1, tax payments shall be due as provided in paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In any city or town which has adopted both an optional fiscal year and quarterly billing, taxes shall be collected in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Tax payments shall be due July 1, October 1, January 2, and March 31 of each fiscal year to fund the optional fiscal year budget which is the basis upon which the tax rate shall be established by the department of revenue administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A quarterly billing of the taxes to be due in any tax year shall be computed by taking the previous year's assessed valuation times the previous year's tax rate, as determined by the department of revenue administration, divided by 4;  provided, however, that whenever it appears to the assessors that certain individual properties have changed in valuation, they may use the current year's appraisal times the previous year's tax rate divided by 4 to compute the quarterly payment.  Quarterly payments of taxes assessed under this section shall be due and payable on July 1 and October 1.  For the purpose of the quarterly payments, a list of assessed property shall be committed by the board of assessors with warrants under their hands and seal directed to the collector no later than May 15.  The collector shall mail all the bills for the 2 quarterly payments no later than 30 days before their due dates.  The collector shall receive such payments and credit the amount paid towards the amount of the taxes eventually assessed against the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Payments of the remainder of the taxes, minus the 2 quarterly payments due on July 1 and October 1 of that year, shall be due and payable in 2 equal billings on January 2 and March 31.  For the purpose of these final remaining quarterly payments, the assessor shall commit warrants to the collector.  The collector shall mail all the bills for the 2 remaining tax payments no later than 30 days before their due dates.  For purposes of RSA 76:16, RSA 76:16-a, and RSA 76:17, the "notice of tax'' shall mean the date the board of tax and land appeals determines to be the last date of mailing of the January 2 quarterly tax bill, which bill is based on the current year's tax rate and assessments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For the purpose of establishing the real estate tax lien under the provisions of RSA 80:59, for the tax bills due and payable each year after the adoption of quarterly tax billing, the real estate of every person or corporation may be subject to the tax lien procedure by the collector, in case all taxes against the owner shall not be paid in full on or before April 1 next after its assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If, subsequent to the collector issuing quarterly bills, the assessors are made aware of a change in ownership in a parcel so billed, the assessors shall amend the tax list and notify the collector, who, upon the request of the new owner, shall cause to be mailed to the new owner a statement of account showing the balance due on the current quarterly billing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum shall be charged on all taxes not paid on or before their due dates or 30 days after mailing, whichever is later.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs II and III, any municipality with quarterly billing affected by a change in adequate education grants or excess tax amounts, determined pursuant to RSA 198:41, may apply to the commissioner of revenue administration on forms prescribed by the commissioner to adjust the  1/4 of the previous year's tax rate by an amount sufficient to collect  1/4 of the estimated increase or decrease in the July and October quarterly bills in local school tax resulting from the change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The department of education shall certify, no later than November 15, to the commissioner of the department of revenue administration the difference in the amount of the adequate education grants and excess tax amounts between the current fiscal year and the forthcoming fiscal year for every municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any municipality requesting an adjusted rate for the quarterly bills shall submit such request to the commissioner of the department of revenue administration by April 1 prior to the issuance of the July and October quarterly bills.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The department of revenue administration shall expedite certified adjusted rate applications.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever the board of tax and land appeals, pursuant to RSA 76:16-a, or the superior court, pursuant to RSA 76:17, grants an abatement on the grounds of an incorrect property assessment value, the selectmen or assessors shall thereafter use the correct assessment value, as found by the board or the court, in assessing subsequent taxes upon that property, until such time as they, in good faith, reappraise the property pursuant to RSA 75:8 due to changes in value, or until there is a general reassessment in the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If, while an appeal pursuant to RSA 76:16-a or 76:17 is pending, subsequent taxes are assessed using an assessment value later found to be incorrect by the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court, the selectmen or assessors shall abate such subsequent taxes, using the correct assessment value as found by the board or the court, even if no abatement request or appeal has ever been filed with respect to such subsequent taxes.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board of tax and land appeals and the superior court shall retain continuing jurisdiction over any abatement granted by them pursuant to RSA 76:16-a or 76:17 respectively, for purposes of enforcing the requirements of this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 76:21 Prorated Assessments for Damaged Buildings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever a taxable building is damaged due to unintended fire or natural disaster to the extent that it renders the building not able to be used for its intended use, the assessing officials shall prorate the assessment for the building for the current tax year.  For purposes of this paragraph, an unintended fire means a fire which does not arise out of any act committed by or at the direction of the property owner with the intent to cause a loss.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The proration of the building assessment shall be based on the number of days that the building was available for its intended use divided by the number of days in the tax year, multiplied by the building assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person aggrieved of a property tax for a building damaged as provided in paragraph I shall file an application with the assessing officials in writing within 60 days of the event described in paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Proration of the assessment shall be denied if the assessing officials determine that the applicant did not meet the requirements of this section or acted in bad faith.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The total tax reduction from proration under this section for any city or town shall be limited to an amount equal to  1/2 of one percent of the total property taxes committed in the tax year.  If the assessing officials determine that it is likely that this limit will be reached, the proration shall not be applied to any additional properties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Nothing in this section shall limit the ability of the assessing officials to abate taxes for good cause shown pursuant to RSA 76:16.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Appeals of a decision under this section shall be to the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court as set forth in RSA 76:16-a or RSA 76:17.
