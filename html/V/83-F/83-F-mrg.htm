In no case, however, shall the penalty be less than $250 or more than $2,500.  This penalty shall be treated as incident to the tax and shall be in addition to any other penalty applicable pursuant to paragraph VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. No later than 30 days subsequent to the sale or transfer of a utility's property or assets, the taxpayer acquiring such property or assets shall notify the department in writing.
