&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 77-B:9 Form and Verification of Returns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Returns shall be in such form as the commissioner of revenue administration may from time to time prescribe and shall be filed at any office which may be established on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year.  In case of sickness, absence or other disability, or whenever good cause exists, the commissioner of revenue administration may allow further time for filing returns.  Returns shall be verified by written declarations that the statements therein are made subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.  When a return is made for a corporation or partnership, the person signing such return shall be deemed to be the person subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall cause to be prepared blank forms for the returns and shall cause them to be distributed throughout the state and to be furnished upon application, but failure to receive or secure the form shall not relieve a taxpayer from the obligation of making the return herein required.
