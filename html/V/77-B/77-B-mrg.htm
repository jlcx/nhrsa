<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A resident having for such taxable year any New Hampshire taxable income as defined in RSA 77-B:1;  provided, however, that if it shall appear to the satisfaction of the commissioner of revenue administration that any residents of this state, or class of residents of this state, who are subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, are liable for tax upon the same income under the law imposed for the taxable year by another state and are thereby entitled to a credit allowed by RSA 77-B:5 against the tax otherwise due under this chapter, the commissioner of revenue administration shall by regulation relieve such residents or class of residents from being required to make any return under this chapter.
