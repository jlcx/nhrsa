&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 77-B:14 Amount of Withheld Taxes as Lien Against Employer. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If any employer required to deduct and withhold a tax under RSA 77-B:10 neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount, including interest after such demand, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto, shall be a lien in favor of the state of New Hampshire upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such employer.  Such lien shall arise at the time the assessment and demand is made by the commissioner of revenue administration and shall continue until the liability for such sum, with interest and costs, is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.  Such lien shall be valid as against any subsequent mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser or judgment creditor when notice of such lien and the sum due has been filed by the commissioner of revenue administration with the clerk of the town or city in which the property subject to the lien is situated, or, in the case of an unorganized town or grant, in the office of the register of deeds for the county wherein such property is situated.  In the case of any prior mortgage on real or personal property so written as to secure a present debt and also future advances by the mortgagee to the mortgagor, the lien herein provided, when notice thereof has been filed in the proper clerk's office, shall be subject to such prior mortgage unless the commissioner of revenue administration also notifies the mortgagee of the recording of such lien in writing, in which case any indebtedness thereafter created from mortgagor to mortgagee shall be junior to the lien herein provided for.
