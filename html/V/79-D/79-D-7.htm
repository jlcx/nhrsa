&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The method of assessment of discretionary preservation easement structures shall be included as a term of the agreement in any discretionary preservation easement acquired by a municipality.  Assessment shall fall within a range, one end of which shall be 75 percent of the full value assessment;  the other end of the range shall be 25 percent of said full value assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The local governing body shall have the discretion to set the value of the discretionary preservation easement at a level within this range which it believes reflects the public benefit conferred by the property under the criteria set forth in RSA 79-D:3, II.  The assessment shall not be increased because the owner undertakes maintenance and repairs designed to preserve the structure.
