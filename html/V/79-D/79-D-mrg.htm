&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-D:1 Declaration of Public Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared to be in the public interest to encourage the preservation of historic agricultural structures which are potentially subject to decay or demolition, thus maintaining the historic rural character of the state's landscape, sustaining agricultural traditions, and providing an attractive scenic environment for work and recreation of the state's citizens and visitors.  It is further declared to be in the public interest to prevent the loss of historic agricultural structures due to property taxation at values incompatible with their preservation.  The means for encouraging preservation of historic agricultural structures authorized by this chapter is the acquisition of discretionary preservation easements by town or city governments to assure preservation of such structures which provide a demonstrated public benefit.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any owner of an historic agricultural structure who wishes to maintain the structure in a use consistent with the purposes of this chapter may apply to the governing body of the municipality in which the property is located to convey a discretionary preservation easement to the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A discretionary preservation easement shall be considered to provide a demonstrated public benefit if it provides at least one of the following public benefits:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) There is scenic enjoyment of the structure by the general public from a public way or from public waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-D:4 Application Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any owner of an historic agricultural structure which meets the tests of public benefit in RSA 79-D:3, II may apply to the governing body to grant a discretionary preservation easement to the municipality, agreeing to maintain the structure in keeping with its historic integrity and character during the term of the easement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No owner of an historic agricultural structure shall be entitled to have a particular structure classified for any tax year under the provisions of this chapter unless the owner has applied to the governing body on or before April 15 of the tax year on a form provided by the commissioner of the department of revenue administration.  Such application shall include a map showing the location of the structure to be subject to the discretionary preservation easement, and a description of how the property meets the tests of public benefit in RSA 79-D:3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-D:5 Approval, Denial. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If, after a duly noticed public hearing, the governing body finds that the proposed preservation of such historic agricultural structure is consistent with the purposes of this chapter, it may take steps to acquire a discretionary preservation easement as provided in this chapter.  In exercising its discretion, the local governing body may weigh the public benefit to be obtained versus the tax revenue to be lost if such an easement is granted.  The governing body shall have no more than 60 days to act upon the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the governing body denies the application to grant a discretionary preservation easement to the municipality, such denial shall be accompanied by a written explanation.  The local governing body's decision may be appealed by using the procedures of either RSA 79-A:9 or 79-A:11 provided, however, that such denial shall be deemed discretionary and shall not be set aside by the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court except for bad faith, discrimination, or the application of criteria other than those set forth in RSA 79-D:3 and paragraph I of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The easement shall be a burden upon the property and shall bind all transferees and assignees of such property.  An easement granted pursuant to this subdivision shall not be assigned, transferred, or released by the municipality without the consent of the owner, except as provided in RSA 79-D:8.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 79-D:8 Release of Easement, Expiration, Renewal, Consideration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any property owner who has granted a discretionary preservation easement to a municipality pursuant to the terms of this chapter, after the effective date of this chapter, may apply to the local governing body of the municipality in which the property subject to a discretionary preservation easement is located for a release from such easement upon a demonstration of extreme personal hardship.  Upon release from such easement, a property owner shall pay the following consideration to the tax collector of the municipality:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For a release within the first half of the duration of the easement, 20 percent of the full value assessment of such structure and land under RSA 75:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For a release within the second half of the duration of the easement, 15 percent of the full value assessment of such structure and land under RSA 75:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the expiration of the terms of the discretionary easement, the owner may apply for a renewal, and the owner and local governing body shall have the same rights and duties with respect to the renewal application as they did with respect to the original application;  provided, however, that at the time of the original granting of the discretionary preservation easement, the parties may include, as a term of the agreement, a provision for automatic renewal for the same term as the original.  Such a provision may include the specification of the manner in which the tax assessment on the property for the next term is to be determined at the time of renewal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The tax collector shall issue a receipt to the owner of such property and a copy to the local governing body for the sums paid.  The local governing body shall, upon receiving a copy of the above-mentioned consideration, execute a release or renewal of the easement to the owner who shall record such a release or renewal.  A copy of such release or renewal shall also be sent to the local assessing officials if they are not the same parties executing the release or renewal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In the event that the structure is destroyed by fire, storm, or other unforeseen circumstance not within the control of the property owner, the preservation easement shall be released without penalty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If, during the term of the preservation easement, the owner shall fail to maintain the structure in conformity with the agreement, or shall cause the structure(s) to significantly deteriorate or be demolished or removed, the preservation easement shall be terminated and a penalty assessed in accordance with RSA 79-D:8, I(a) and (b).
