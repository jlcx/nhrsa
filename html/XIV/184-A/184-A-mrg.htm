Article I
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Statement of Purpose, Findings and Declaration of Policy</b>
</p>
</center>
Section 1. Statement of Purpose, Findings and Declaration of Policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this compact is to recognize by constitutional prerequisite the interstate character of the northeast dairy industry and to form an interstate commission for the northeast region.  The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the northeast, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is the paramount agricultural activity of the northeast.  Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors and retailers, are an integral component of the region's economy.  Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential to the region's rural communities and character.  The farms preserve open spaces, sculpt the landscape and provide the land base for a diversity of recreational pursuits.  In defining the rural character of our communities and landscape, dairy farms also provide a major draw for our tourist industries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which northeast dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest.  Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the northeast dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Recent dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the northeast dairy region.  Historically, individual state regulatory action has been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market.  The federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices for dairy products, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.  Based on this authority, each state in the region has individually attempted to implement at least one regulatory program in response to the current dairy industry crisis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action may address more effectively the market disarray.  Under our constitutional system, properly authorized, states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority.  For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders.  Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the federal order system be discontinued.  In that event, the interstate commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system.  This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed.  It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the order system.

The establishment of a regulated area which covers all or part of a participating state shall require also the affirmative vote of that state's delegation.  A majority of the delegations from the participating states shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of the commission's business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 3. Administration and Management.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<p>
<b>Powers of the Commission</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 1. Powers to Promote Regulatory Uniformity, Simplicity, and Interstate Cooperation.  The commission is hereby empowered to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Investigate or provide for investigations or research projects designed to review the existing laws and regulations of the participating states, to consider their administration and costs, to measure their impact on the production and marketing of milk and their effects on the shipment of milk and milk products within the region.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Prepare and transmit to the participating states model dairy laws and regulations dealing with the inspection of farms and plants, sanitary codes, labels for dairy products and their imitations, standards for dairy products, license standards, producer security programs, and fair trade laws.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Study and recommend to the participating states joint or cooperative programs for the administration of the dairy laws and regulations and to prepare estimates of cost savings and benefits of such programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Encourage the harmonious relationships between the various elements in the industry for the solution of their material problems.  Conduct symposiums or conferences designed to improve industry relations for a better understanding of problems.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Prepare and release periodic reports on activities and results of the commission's efforts to the participating states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Review the existing marketing system for milk and milk products and recommend changes in the existing structure for assembly and distribution of milk which may assist, improve, or promote more efficient assembly and distribution of milk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Investigate costs and charges for producing, hauling, handling, processing, distributing, selling and for all other services performed with respect to milk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Examine current economic forces affecting producers, probable trends in production and consumption, the level of dairy farm prices in relation to costs, the financial conditions of dairy farmers, and the need for an emergency order to relieve critical conditions on dairy farms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 2. Equitable Farm Prices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The powers granted in this section and Article IV, section 3 shall apply only to the establishment of a compact over-order price, so long as federal milk marketing orders remain in effect in the region.  In the event that any or all such orders are terminated, this article shall authorize the commission to establish one or more commission marketing orders, as herein provided, in the region or parts thereof as defined in the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A compact over-order price established pursuant to this section shall apply only to Class I milk.  Such over-order price shall not exceed $1.50 per gallon.  Beginning in 1990, and using that year as a base, the foregoing $1.50 per gallon maximum shall be adjusted annually by the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.  For purposes of the pooling and equalization of an over-order price, the value of milk used in other use classifications shall be calculated at the appropriate class price established pursuant to the applicable federal order or state dairy regulation and the value of unregulated milk shall be calculated in relation to the nearest prevailing class price in accordance with and subject to such adjustments as the commission may prescribe in regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A commission marketing order shall apply to all classes and uses of milk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission is hereby empowered to establish the minimum price for milk to be paid by pool plants, partially regulated plants and all other handlers receiving milk from producers located in a regulated area.  This price shall be established either as a compact over-order price or by one or more commission marketing orders.  Whenever such a price has been established by either type of regulation, the legal obligation to pay such price shall be determined solely by the terms and purpose of the regulation without regard to the situs of the transfer of title, possession or any other factors not related to the purposes of the regulation and this compact.  Producer-handlers as defined in an applicable federal market order shall not be subject to a compact over-order price.  The commission shall provide for similar treatment of producer-handlers under commission marketing orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In determining the price, the commission shall consider the balance between production and consumption of milk and milk products in the regulated area, the costs of production including, but not limited to the price of feed, the cost of labor including the reasonable value of the producer's own labor and management, machinery expense, and interest expense, the prevailing price for milk outside the regulated area, the purchasing power of the public and the price necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producer and distributor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When establishing a compact over-order price, the commission shall take such action as necessary and feasible to ensure that the over-order price does not create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies of milk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commission shall whenever possible enter into agreements with state or federal agencies for exchange of information or services for the purpose of reducing regulatory burden and cost of administering the compact.  The commission may reimburse other agencies for the reasonable cost of providing these services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 3. Optional Provisions for Pricing Order.  Regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order may contain, but shall not be limited to, any of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Provisions classifying milk in accordance with the form in which or purpose for which it is used, or creating a flat pricing program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. With respect to a commission marketing order only, provisions establishing or providing a method for establishing separate minimum prices for each use classification prescribed by the commission, or a single minimum price for milk purchased from producers or associations of producers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. With respect to an over-order minimum price, provisions establishing or providing a method for establishing such minimum price for Class I milk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Provisions for establishing either an over-order price or a commission marketing order may make use of any reasonable method for establishing such price or prices including flat pricing and formula pricing.  Provision may also be made for location adjustments, zone differentials and for competitive credits with respect to regulated handlers who market outside the regulated area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Provisions for the payment to all producers and associations of producers delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices for all milk so delivered, irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered, or for the payment of producers delivering milk to the same handler of uniform prices for all milk delivered by them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) With respect to regulations establishing a compact over-order price, the commission may establish one equalization pool within the regulated area for the sole purpose of equalizing returns to producers throughout the regulated area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) With respect to any commission marketing order, as defined in Article II, section 1, IX, which replaces one or more terminated federal orders or state dairy regulations, the marketing area of now separate state or federal orders shall not be merged without the affirmative consent of each state, voting through its delegation, which is partly or wholly included within any such new marketing area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Provisions requiring persons who bring Class I milk into the regulated area to make compensatory payments with respect to all such milk to the extent necessary to equalize the cost of milk purchased by handlers subject to a compact over-order price or commission marketing order.  No such provisions shall discriminate against milk producers outside the regulated area.  The provisions for compensatory payments may require payment of the difference between the Class I price required to be paid for such milk in the state of production by a federal milk marketing order or state dairy regulation and the Class I price established by the compact over-order price or commission marketing order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Provisions specially governing the pricing and pooling of milk handled by partially regulated plants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Provisions requiring that the account of any person regulated under a compact over-order price shall be adjusted for any payments made to or received by such persons with respect to a producer settlement fund of any federal or state milk marketing order or other state dairy regulation within the regulated area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Provisions requiring the payment by handlers of an assessment to cover the costs of the administration and enforcement of such order pursuant to Article VII, section 1, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Provisions for reimbursement to participants of the Women, Infants, and Children Special Supplemental Food Program of the United States Child Nutrition Act of 1966.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Other provisions and requirements as the commission may find are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this compact and to provide for the payment of fair and equitable minimum prices to producers.

<b>Rulemaking Procedure</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 1. Rulemaking Procedure.  Before promulgation of any regulations establishing a compact over-order price or commission marketing order, including any provision with respect to milk supply under Article IV, section 2, VI, or amendment thereof, as provided in Article IV, the commission shall conduct an informal rulemaking proceeding to provide interested persons with an opportunity to present data and views.  Such rulemaking proceeding shall be governed by section 4 of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 553).  In addition, the commission shall, to the extent practicable, publish notice of rulemaking proceedings in the official register of each participating state.  Before the initial adoption of regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order and thereafter before any amendment with regard to prices or assessments, the commission shall hold a public hearing.  The commission may commence a rulemaking proceeding on its own initiative or may in its sole discretion act upon the petition of any person including individual milk producers, any organization of milk producers or handlers, general farm organizations, consumer or public interest groups, and local, state or federal officials.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 2. Findings and Referendum.  In addition to the concise general statement of basis and purpose required by section 4(b) of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended, (5 U.S.C. Section 553(c)), the commission shall make findings of fact with respect to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whether the public interest will be served by the establishment of minimum milk prices to dairy farmers under Article IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. What level of prices will assure that producers receive a price sufficient to cover their costs of production and will elicit an adequate supply of milk for the inhabitants of the regulated area and for manufacturing purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whether the major provisions of the order, other than those fixing minimum milk prices, are in the public interest and are reasonably designed to achieve the purposes of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Whether the terms of the proposed regional order or amendment are approved by producers as provided in Article V, section 3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 3. Producer Referendum.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For the purpose of ascertaining whether the issuance or amendment of regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order, including any provision with respect to milk supply under Article IV, section 2, VI, is approved by producers, the commission shall conduct a referendum among producers.  The referendum shall be held in a timely manner, as determined by regulations of the commission.  The terms and conditions of the proposed order or amendment shall be described by the commission in the ballot used in the conduct of the referendum, but the nature, content, or extent of such description shall not be a basis for attacking the legality of the order or any action relating thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An order or amendment shall be deemed approved by producers if the commission determines that it is approved by at least  2/3 of the voting producers who, during a representative period determined by the commission, have been engaged in the production of milk the price of which would be regulated under the proposed order or amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For purposes of any referendum, the commission shall consider the approval or disapproval by any cooperative association of producers, qualified under the provisions of the Act of Congress of February 18, 1922, as amended, known as the Capper-Volstead Act, which is bona fide engaged in marketing milk, or in rendering services for or advancing the interests of producers of such commodity, as the approval or disapproval of the producers who are members or stockholders in, or under contract with, such cooperative association of producers, except as provided in subparagraph (a) hereof and subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (b) through (e) hereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No cooperative which has been formed to act as a common marketing agency for both cooperatives and individual producers shall be qualified to block vote for either.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any cooperative which is qualified to block vote shall, before submitting its approval or disapproval in any referendum, give prior written notice to each of its members as to whether and how it intends to cast its vote.  The notice shall be given in a timely manner and in the form prescribed by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any producer may obtain a ballot from the commission in order to register approval or disapproval of the proposed order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A producer who is a member of a cooperative which has provided notice of its intent to approve or not to approve a proposed order, and who obtains a ballot and with such ballot expresses his approval or disapproval of the proposed order, shall notify the commission as to the name of the cooperative of which he or she is a member, and the commission shall remove such producer's name from the list certified by such cooperative with its corporate vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In order to insure that all milk producers are informed regarding a proposed order, the commission shall notify all milk producers that an order is being considered and that each producer may register his approval or disapproval with the commission either directly or through his or her cooperative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 4. Termination of Over-Order Price or Marketing Order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission shall terminate any regulations establishing an over-order price or commission marketing order issued under this article whenever it finds that such order or price obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of this compact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall terminate any regulations establishing an over-order price or a commission marketing order issued under this article whenever it finds that such termination is favored by a majority of the producers who, during a representative period determined by the commission, have been engaged in the production of milk the price of which is regulated by such order;  but such termination shall be effective only if announced on or before such date as may be specified in such marketing agreement or order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The termination or suspension of any order or provision thereof, shall not be considered an order within the meaning of this article and shall require no hearing, but shall comply with the requirements for informal rulemaking prescribed by section 4 of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 553).

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 1. Records, Reports, Access to Premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission may by rule and regulation prescribe record keeping and reporting requirements for all regulated persons.  For purposes of the administration and enforcement of this compact, the commission is authorized to examine the books and records of any regulated person relating to his or her milk business and for that purpose, the commission's properly designated officers, employees, or agents shall have full access during normal business hours to the premises and records of all regulated persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Information furnished to or acquired by the commission officers, employees, or its agents pursuant to this section shall be confidential and not subject to disclosure except to the extent that the commission deems disclosure to be necessary in any administrative or judicial proceeding involving the administration or enforcement of this compact, an over-order price, a compact marketing order, or other regulations of the commission.  The commission may promulgate regulations further defining the confidentiality of information pursuant to this section.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit (a) the issuance of general statements based upon the reports of a number of handlers, which do not identify the information furnished by any person, or (b) the publication by direction of the commission of the name of any person violating any regulation of the commission, together with a statement of the particular provisions violated by such person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No officer, employee, or agent of the commission shall intentionally disclose information, by inference or otherwise, which is made confidential pursuant to this section and any person violating the provisions of this section shall upon conviction be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for not more than one year, or to both, and shall be removed from office.  The commission shall refer any allegation of a violation of this section to the appropriate state enforcement authority or United States Attorney.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 2. Subpoena, Hearings and Judicial Review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission is hereby authorized and empowered by its members and its properly designated officers to administer oaths and issue subpoenas throughout all signatory states to compel the attendance of witnesses and the giving of testimony and the production of other evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any handler subject to an order may file a written petition with the commission stating that any such order or any provision of any such order or any obligation imposed in connection therewith is not in accordance with law and praying for a modification thereof or to be exempted therefrom.  He shall thereupon be given an opportunity for a hearing upon such petition, in accordance with regulations made by the commission.  After such hearing, the commission shall make a ruling upon the prayer of such petition which shall be final, if in accordance with law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The district courts of the United States in any district in which such handler is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, are hereby vested with jurisdiction in equity to review such ruling, provided a bill in equity for that purpose is filed within 30 days from the date of the entry of such ruling.  Service of process in such proceedings may be had upon the commission by delivering to it a copy of the bill of complaint.  If the court determines that such ruling is not in accordance with law, it shall remand such proceedings to the commission with directions either (a) to make such ruling as the court shall determine to be in accordance with law, or (b) to take such further proceedings as, in its opinion, the law requires.  The pendency of proceedings instituted pursuant to this subdivision shall not impede, hinder, or delay the commission from obtaining relief pursuant to Article VII, section 1.  Any proceedings brought pursuant to Article VII, section 1 (except where brought by way of counterclaim in proceedings instituted pursuant to this section) shall abate whenever a final decree has been rendered in proceedings between the same parties, and covering the same subject matter, instituted pursuant to this section.

Section 3. Enforcement With Respect to Handlers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any violation of the provisions of regulations establishing an over-order price or a commission marketing order, or other regulations adopted pursuant to this compact shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Constitute a violation of the laws of each of the signatory states.  Such violation shall render the violator subject to a civil penalty in an amount as may be prescribed by the laws of each of the participating states, recoverable in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.  Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Constitute grounds for the revocation of license or permit to engage in the milk business under the applicable laws of the participating states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An action for legal or equitable relief brought in the name of the commission in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) With the agreement of the appropriate state agency of a participating state, by referral to the state agency for enforcement by judicial or administrative remedy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission may bring an action for injunction to enforce the provisions of this compact or the order or regulations adopted thereunder without being compelled to allege or prove that an adequate remedy of law does not exist.

Section 1. Finance of Start-up and Regular Costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To provide for its start-up costs, the commission may borrow money pursuant to its general power under Article III, section 3, IV(d).  In order to finance the costs of administration and enforcement of this compact, including pay back of start-up costs, the commission is hereby empowered to collect an assessment from each handler who purchases milk from producers within the region.  If imposed, the assessment shall be collected on a monthly basis for up to one year from the date the commission convenes, in an amount not to exceed  1/10 of one percent of the applicable federal milk market order blend price per hundred weight of milk purchased from producers during the period of the assessment.  The initial assessment may apply to the projected purchases of handlers for the 2-month period following the date the commission convenes.  In addition, if regulations establishing an over-order price or a compact marketing order are adopted, they may include an assessment for the specific purpose of their administration.  These regulations shall provide for establishment of a reserve for the commission's on-going expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commission shall not pledge the credit of any participating state or of the United States.  Notes issued by the commission and all other financial obligations incurred by it, shall be its sole responsibility and no participating state or the United States shall be liable therefor.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Section 2. Audit and Accounts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In addition, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the participating states and by any persons authorized by the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any participating state or of the United States.
