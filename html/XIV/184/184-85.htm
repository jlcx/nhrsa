All milk plants located within the state shall file with their application a listing of the names and addresses of all milk producers furnishing them with milk or milk products.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A license will be granted upon the express condition that the applicant shall at all times conduct his operation and maintain his facilities in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision and all rules adopted under this subdivision.  All licenses shall be issued for a period of one year or portion of a year and expire on the first day of January next following their issuance.

III. Annual graduated license fees shall be set by rules adopted by the commissioner, pursuant to RSA 541-A, and shall be based on the administrative costs associated with the licensing and regulation of milk plants, milk distributors and milk producer-distributors.
