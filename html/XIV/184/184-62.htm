<codesect>
If the commissioner, or his deputy, has reason to believe that milk or cream, or part thereof, is produced or kept under unsanitary conditions he shall inspect the dairy and premises of the producer thereof, and shall issue such instructions as in his judgment will effect improvement to a satisfactory standard.  In case his instructions are not complied with he may order, in writing, the owners, operators or managers of any station receiving such milk or cream and of neighboring receiving stations, to refuse to receive such milk or cream until permitted so to do by order of the commissioner.  Whoever disobeys such order or any instruction issued under the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a violation.
