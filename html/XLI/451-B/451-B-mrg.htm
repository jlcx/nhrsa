Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, every person who shall repair, at the request of the owner, any article of personal property, the fair market value of which is not greater than $1,000, shall have a lien upon the property and may retain the possession of the article of property until the charges for such repair have been paid.

If a debt for repair services remains unpaid for 60 days from the date that they are completed, the holder of the lien established by the previous section may sell the article at public sale in accordance with RSA 444:3, RSA 444:5, and, in the event a prior lienholder has been disclosed by the property owner, in accordance with the notice to lienholder provisions of RSA 444:4-a or RSA 450-A:4, as applicable, provided that the lienholder gives a 30-day written notice by verified mail, as defined in RSA 451-C:1, VII, to the owner of the article before such sale.  The proceeds, after first paying the expense of sale, shall be applied in payment of the debt.
