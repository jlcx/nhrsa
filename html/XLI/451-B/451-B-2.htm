Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, every person who shall repair, at the request of the owner, any article of personal property, the fair market value of which is not greater than $1,000, shall have a lien upon the property and may retain the possession of the article of property until the charges for such repair have been paid.  Further, persons who repair articles of personal property shall provide notice that the owner of such personal property must disclose any prior lienholders having a security interest in such personal property at the time repairs are requested.
