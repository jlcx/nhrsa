&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 447-A:3 How Secured. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any principal broker's notice of lien shall be recorded at the registry of deeds in the county where the property is located.  In the case of a sale, where the principal broker claims a fee or commission against the seller, the notice of lien shall be recorded prior to the recording of the deed conveying or transferring title to the commercial real estate from seller to purchaser.  If the commission is payable by the purchaser, the notice of lien shall be recorded within 90 days of the recording of the deed conveying title to the property, but must be recorded prior to the recording of a deed conveying that purchaser's title to the property to a bona fide purchaser for value.
