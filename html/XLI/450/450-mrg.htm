The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the priority of mechanics' and materialmen's liens.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any other provision of law, all liens arising under this section shall be filed at the office of the secretary of state.  The fees for filing such liens and any releases thereof shall be in accordance with RSA 478:17-g.  A copy of the lien shall also be filed with the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Registry.

(3) The amount of unpaid assessments currently due or past due together with the date when each fell due;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The date of issuance of the lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) It shall be the duty of the secretary of state to file and index the lien in the names of the persons or entities identified as the owner, as well as in the name of the state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When payment or satisfaction is made of a debt secured by a lien, the lien shall be released by filing a release of lien with the secretary of state and the Federal Aviation Administration.  For the purposes of this section, the state shall be deemed the duly authorized agent of the lien creditor and shall discharge the lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit actions at law to recover a sum for which paragraph I creates a lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII.
