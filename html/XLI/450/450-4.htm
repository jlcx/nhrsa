&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any other provision of law, all liens arising under this section shall be filed at the office of the secretary of state.  The fees for filing such liens and any releases thereof shall be in accordance with RSA 478:17-g.  A copy of the lien shall also be filed with the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Registry.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The name or names of the persons or entities designated as an owner of the aircraft and the applicable addresses;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The amount of unpaid assessments currently due or past due together with the date when each fell due;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The date of issuance of the lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) It shall be the duty of the secretary of state to file and index the lien in the names of the persons or entities identified as the owner, as well as in the name of the state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The judgment or decree in an action brought pursuant to this section shall include, without limitation, reimbursement for costs and attorneys' fees, plus interest at the maximum lawful rate for the sums secured by the lien from the time such sum became due and payable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When payment or satisfaction is made of a debt secured by a lien, the lien shall be released by filing a release of lien with the secretary of state and the Federal Aviation Administration.  For the purposes of this section, the state shall be deemed the duly authorized agent of the lien creditor and shall discharge the lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII.
