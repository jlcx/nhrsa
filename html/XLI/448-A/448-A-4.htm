<codesect>
Every town or city clerk shall, at the expense of the town or city, provide a book or card filing system to be called the hospital and home health care provider lien docket in which, upon the filing of any lien claim under the provisions of this chapter, he shall enter the name of the injured person, the name of the person, firm or corporation alleged to be liable for the injuries, the date of the accident and the name of the hospital, home health care provider, or other institution making the claim.  The clerk shall make a proper index of the same in the name of the injured person, and such clerk shall be entitled to be paid a fee of $15 by the lien claimant for such filing.  In lieu of maintaining a separate filing system and index for such liens, any clerk may maintain a combined filing system and index that include other liens.
