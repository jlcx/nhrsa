As of July 1, 2017, all remaining records of, or relating to, financing statements filed in such office under RSA 454-B may be destroyed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Until July 1, 2017, a former filing office shall respond to a request for information concerning its records in the same way and to the same extent as is required of the secretary of state under RSA 382-A:9-523(c), (d), and (e), and shall be entitled to charge and retain the same fees as are prescribed in RSA 382:9-525(d).
