<codesect>
If any of the rent, charges, fees, or expenses referred to in this chapter shall remain unpaid for 5 days, the owner may place a lock on the storage unit, in addition to any lock placed thereon by the occupant.

Proceeds from the sale shall be distributed pursuant to RSA 451-C:6.

<center><h3>Section 451-C:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 451-C:4 Notice to Lienholder. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An owner shall inquire in writing, by verified mail, to determine from the division of motor vehicles and the secretary of state with regard to a motor vehicle, and from the secretary of state with regard to other personal property, whether a lien exists upon the title to said motor vehicle or other personal property.  Any such written inquiry that requests information on financing statements filed under RSA 382-A shall be in the form, and subject to the fees, required by that chapter.  If no lien is found, or in the case where the inquiry had been made in writing and no response is received from the division of motor vehicles or the secretary of state within 14 days after such inquiry is sent by verified mail, the owner may proceed to sell or otherwise dispose of such personal property as prescribed by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If determination is made under the procedure described in paragraph I that a lien exists, a notice of sale under this chapter shall be sent by verified mail to the last known address of each holder of a security interest or lienholder in accordance with RSA 382-A:9.  The notice shall state the time and place of the sale, the property to be sold, and the amount of the rent, charges, fees, or expenses owed.  The notice shall be sent at least 20 days prior to the date of the sale, except that in the case of a motor vehicle, notice shall be sent at least 30 days prior to the date of the sale.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any lienholder having a properly perfected lien or security interest shall be entitled to remove such personal property from the owner's possession or from the occupant's self-service storage facility unit within 20 days of the date of mailing of the notice of the sale, without attachment of the lien established under RSA 451-C:2 or any further obligation to the owner of the self-service storage facility.  The lienholder's right to possession of the personal property is established under this chapter notwithstanding the lack of breach by the owner of such personal property under the debt instrument or security agreement creating the lien or security interest on such property.  The owner shall not be responsible for determining priority as between any competing lienholders.  If the owner and the lienholder who has received the notice agree to store the personal property at the facility, the lienholder shall pay the amount of the rent, charges, fees, or expenses due from and after the date of the notice to the lienholder, and pay the monthly rental fee until such personal property is removed from the facility.
