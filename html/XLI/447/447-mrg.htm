&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 447:12-a Attachment Priority. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Such attachment shall have precedence and priority over any construction mortgage.  For the purposes of this section, a construction mortgage shall mean any mortgage loan made for the purpose of financing the construction, repair or alteration of any structure on the mortgaged premises where the lien secured by such attachment arises from the same construction, repair or alteration work.  However, such attachment shall not be entitled to precedence as provided in this section to the extent that the mortgagee shows that the proceeds of the mortgage loan were disbursed either toward payment of invoices from or claims due subcontractors and suppliers of materials or labor for the work on the mortgaged premises, or upon receipt by the mortgagee from the mortgagor or his agent of an affidavit that the work on the mortgaged premises for which such disbursement is to be made has been completed and that the subcontractors and suppliers of materials or labor have been paid for their share of such work, or will be paid out of such disbursement.  A mortgagee shall not knowingly accept a fraudulent affidavit, and shall encourage and promote the practices outlined in RSA 447:12-b.  Any agreement waiving the precedence provided by this section shall be enforceable only upon like showing by the mortgagee.  The precedence provided by this section shall not apply to wage claims of employees working for wages under an employer-employee relationship, as defined in RSA 275:42.  A mortgagor or his agent making a willfully false affidavit under this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person.

I. Within 10 business days of the execution of a construction mortgage, including any refinancing thereof, the mortgagor or his agent shall post in a conspicuous place on the jobsite for which the construction funds were secured, the name, address and telephone number of the institution providing the construction funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person entitled to a lien pursuant to RSA 447:2-7 shall, within 15 business days of the posting required in paragraph I or of commencing to furnish services, materials, supplies or other things, whichever is later, provide written notice to the institution providing the construction funds that such person is furnishing services, materials, supplies or other things.  The written notice provided under this paragraph shall include the name and address of the jobsite.  Failure to provide the notice required by this paragraph shall not alone invalidate the lien created by RSA 447:2-7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At least 48 hours prior to requesting any construction mortgage requisition, the mortgagor or his agent shall post in a conspicuous place on the jobsite for which the construction funds were secured, the anticipated funding date for said requisition.  The mortgagee shall require a copy of said notice, which shall be certified as to its posting by the mortgagor or his agent prior to disbursing any funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the event that a written contract between the mortgagor or his agent and any person furnishing services, materials, supplies or other things shall provide that the disbursement of construction funds, a portion of which is intended to pay such person, shall be by a 2-party check, the mortgagor or his agent shall transmit a copy of such agreement to the mortgagee.  Upon receipt of a copy of such written agreement, the mortgagee shall subsequently disburse funds intended in part to pay any such person only by a check made payable to the mortgagor or his agent and such person.  Unless otherwise agreed by the mortgagor and mortgagee, disbursements shall be made only for actual work completed and materials consumed on the jobsite for which the construction funds were secured.
