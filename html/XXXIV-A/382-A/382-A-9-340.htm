&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Exercise of recoupment or set-off.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a bank with which a deposit account is maintained may exercise any right of recoupment or set-off against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Recoupment or set-off not affected by security interest.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the application of this article to a security interest in a deposit account does not affect a right of recoupment or set-off of the secured party as to a deposit account maintained with the secured party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When set-off ineffective.  The exercise by a bank of a set-off against a deposit account is ineffective against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account which is perfected by control under Section 9-104(a)(3), if the set-off is based on a claim against the debtor.
