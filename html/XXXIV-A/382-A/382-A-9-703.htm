&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Continuing priority over lien creditor:  perfection requirements not satisfied.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-705, if, immediately before this Act takes effect, a security interest is enforceable and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time, but the applicable requirements for enforceability or perfection under this Act are not satisfied when this Act takes effect, the security interest:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) is a perfected security interest for one year after this Act takes effect;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest becomes enforceable under Section 9-203 before the year expires;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act are satisfied before the year expires.
