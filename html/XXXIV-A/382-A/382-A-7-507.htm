<codesect>
If a person negotiates or delivers a document of title for value, otherwise than as a mere intermediary under Section 7-508, unless otherwise agreed, the transferor, in addition to any warranty made in selling or leasing the goods, warrants to its immediate purchaser only that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the document is genuine;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the transferor does not have knowledge of any fact that would impair the document's validity or worth;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the negotiation or delivery is rightful and fully effective with respect to the title to the document and the goods it represents.
