&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-602 Manner and Effect of Rightful Rejection. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender.  It is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subject to the provisions of the two following sections on rejected goods (Sections 2-603 and 2-604),
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) after rejection any exercise of ownership by the buyer with respect to any commercial unit is wrongful as against the seller;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this Article (subsection (3) of Section 2-711), he is under a duty after rejection to hold them with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them;  but
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) the buyer has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The seller's rights with respect to goods wrongfully rejected are governed by the provisions of this Article on Seller's remedies in general (Section 2-703).
