&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods, but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.
