&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:1-202 Notice;  Knowledge. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Subject to subsection (f), a person has "notice'' of a fact if the person:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) has actual knowledge of it;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) has received a notice or notification of it;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that it exists.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Knowledge'' means actual knowledge.  "Knows'' has a corresponding meaning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Discover,'' "learn,'' or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than to reason to know.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A person "notifies'' or "gives'' a notice or notification to another person by taking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Subject to subsection (f), a person "receives'' a notice or notification when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) it comes to that person's attention;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) it is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of such communications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence.  An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines.  Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.

<center><h3>Section 382-A:1-203</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:1-203 Lease Distinguished From Security Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised.  Additional consideration is not nominal if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The "remaining economic life of the goods'' and "reasonably predictable'' fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement shall be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.

<center><h3>Section 382-A:1-303</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:1-303 Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A "course of performance'' is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A "course of dealing'' is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A "usage of trade'' is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.  The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as fact.  If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement.  A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction is unreasonable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Subject to Section 2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-105 Definitions:  Transferability;  "Goods'';  "Future'' Goods;  "Lot'';  "Commercial Unit''. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Goods'' means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and things in action.  "Goods'' also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (Section 2-107).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass.  Goods which are not both existing and identified are "future'' goods.  A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined.  Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) "Lot'' means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) "Commercial unit'' means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use.  A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires "contract'' and "agreement'' are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods.  "Contract for sale'' includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time.  A "sale'' consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401).  A "present sale'' means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming'' or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Termination'' occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.  On "termination'' all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) "Cancellation'' occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination'' except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A contract for the sale of timber, minerals, or the like (including oil and gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this Article if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in subsection (1) is a contract for the sale of goods within this Article whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.

(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods, but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-207 Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract.  Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) they materially alter it;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract.  In such cases the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this chapter.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An agreement modifying a contract within this Article needs no consideration to be binding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article (Section 2-201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-210 Delegation of Performance;  Assignment of Rights. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract.  No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-406, unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance.  A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller.  Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary, a prohibition of assignment of "the contract'' is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) An assignment of "the contract'' or of "all my rights under the contract'' or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties.  This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurance from the assignee (Section 2-609).

(c) the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract.  In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.

(1) An agreement for sale which is otherwise sufficiently definite (subsection (3) of Section 2-204) to be a contract is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties.

(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.

(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.

(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as "warrant'' or "guarantee'' or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.

(1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other;  but subject to the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (Section 2-202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous.  Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description of the face hereof.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, implied warranties may be excluded by expressions like "as is'', "with all faults'' or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him;  and

(c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, in any case in which goods are purchased primarily for personal, family or household use and not for commercial or business use (a consumer sale), disclaimers of the warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose shall not be effective to limit the liability of merchant sellers, unless the seller provides the buyer with a conspicuous writing which must be signed by the buyer and which clearly informs the buyer, prior to or at the time of the sale, in simple and concise language of each of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The goods are being sold on an "as is'' or "with all faults'' basis;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The entire risk as to quality and performance of the goods is with the buyer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the goods prove defective after purchase, the buyer, not the manufacturer, distributor or retailer, shall assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing or repair.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If a consumer sale is made by means of a mail order catalog, the catalog may contain the required writing in lieu of the requirement of notification prior to the sale.  The requirement that the writing be signed by the buyer shall not apply to such sales by means of a mail order catalog.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means "free on board'') at a named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) when the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this Article (Section 2-504) and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provided in this Article (Section 2-503);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board.  If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this Article on the form of bill of lading (Section 2-323).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means "free alongside'') at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which the seller must
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) at his own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the manner usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the buyer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the carrier is under a duty to issue a bill of lading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within subsection (1)(a) or (c) or subsection (2) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of the vessel and in an appropriate case its name and sailing date.  The seller may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation under this Article (Section 2-311).  He may also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.

(1) The term C.I.F. means that the price includes in a lump sum the cost of the goods and the insurance and freight to the named destination.  The term C. & F. or C.F. means that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless otherwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the seller at his own expense and risk to
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern;  but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) prepare an invoice of the goods and procure any other documents required to effect shipment or to comply with the contract;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due form and with any indorsement necessary to perfect the buyer's rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Unless otherwise agreed the term C. & F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Under the term C.I.F. or C. & F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Where the contract contemplates overseas shipment and contains a term C.I.F. or C. & F. or F.O.B. vessel, the seller unless otherwise agreed must obtain a negotiable bill of lading stating that the goods have been loaded on board or, in the case of a term C.I.F. or C. & F., received for shipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where in a case within subsection (1) a tangible bill of lading has been issued in a set of parts, unless otherwise agreed if the documents are not to be sent from abroad the buyer may demand tender of the full set;  otherwise only one part of the bill of lading need be tendered.  Even if the agreement expressly requires a full set
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this Article on cure of improper delivery (subsection (1) of Section 2-508);  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) even though the full set is demanded, if the documents are sent from abroad the person tendering an incomplete set may nevertheless require payment upon furnishing an indemnity which the buyer in good faith deems adequate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A shipment by water or by air or a contract contemplating such shipment is "overseas'' insofar as by usage of trade or agreement it is subject to the commercial, financing or shipping practices characteristic of international deep water commerce.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the subject of a separate sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner.  Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve.  In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale.  In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time.  In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller's behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-329 Servicing of Warranties;  Liability of Manufacturers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Every manufacturer who makes an express warranty pursuant to a sale of a consumer good with a retail value greater than $100 shall provide purchasers with an address or toll-free number for information on warranty service or shall designate one or more representatives within this state to provide services or repairs under the direct terms of the express warranty.  The manufacturer shall make parts available to any authorized New Hampshire service representative within 30 days of receipt of an order by the manufacturer in order to fulfill the terms of the express warranty;  provided, however, that a delay caused by conditions beyond the direct control of the manufacturer including, but not limited to, special recall requirements, labor disputes, acts of God, or transportation delays caused by persons unrelated to the manufacturer shall serve to extend this 30-day requirement.  Where such delays arise, such parts shall be tendered to the service representative as soon as possible following the termination of the condition causing the delay.  The 30-day requirement shall not be extended due to backlogs in processing orders, inadequate inventory, or other delays directly due to the manufacturer or its related entities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Every manufacturer who makes an express warranty pursuant to a consumer sale and designates a representative within this state to provide warranty service shall be liable to such service representative in the amount equal to that which is normally and reasonably charged by the representative for like service and repairs rendered to retail consumers who are not entitled to warranty protection.  This equality of normal and reasonable charges shall apply both to labor and parts.  It shall be a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence that the normal and reasonable cost of service or repair is an amount equal to that which is charged by said service representative for like services or repairs rendered to service or repair customers who are not entitled to warranty protection.  The manufacturer may not waive such liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any manufacturer that sells a consumer good costing more than $100 in this state shall have adequate service information and replacement parts available for direct factory service, for regional service or to their designated service representatives to repair and restore its product to operating condition as provided in the express warranty.  Service information and parts availability shall continue for that period in which the manufacturer must meet its obligation under the terms of the express warranty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with any provision of this section shall be liable, in an action in equity, for injunctive relief, for a civil penalty of $25 per day for each day of non-compliance and shall be liable to the consumer for replacement of the item to be repaired.  Prosecution under the provisions of this section shall be brought by the consumer protection and antitrust bureau, department of justice, if it determines that there has been a violation of this section.  The requirements, remedies, and provisions of this section shall be in addition to the requirements, remedies, and provisions of any other laws which are applicable to the manufacture, sale, or servicing of consumer goods.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-401 Passing of Title;  Reservation for Security;  Limited Application of This Section. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each provision of this Article with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title.  Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this Article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (Section 2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this Act.  Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest.  Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place;  and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment;  but
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) if the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he or she delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller.  Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale''.

(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), rights of unsecured creditors of the seller with respect to goods which have been identified to a contract for sale are subject to the buyer's rights to recover the goods under this Article (Sections 2-502 and 2-716).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A creditor of the seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against him a retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated, except that retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification is not fraudulent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the rights of creditors of the seller

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) under the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) where identification to the contract or delivery is made not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a pre-existing claim for money, security or the like and is made under circumstances which under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated would apart from this Article constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased.  A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value.  When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) it was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale'', or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Entrusting'' includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of the immediately preceding section may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) in the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract;  or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-503 Manner of Seller's Tender of Delivery. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery.  The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this Article, and in particular
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession;  but
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods;  but
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) tender to the buyer of a non-negotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and except as otherwise provided in Article 9 receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons;  but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the non-negotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) he or she must tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this Article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of Section 2-323);  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes non-acceptance or rejection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-504 Shipment by Seller. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Where the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the contract does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then unless otherwise agreed he must
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) put the goods in the possession of such a carrier and make such a contract for their transportation as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) obtain and promptly deliver or tender in due form any document necessary to enable the buyer to obtain possession of the goods or otherwise required by the agreement or by usage of trade;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.
<br>
Failure to notify the buyer under paragraph (c) or to make a proper contract under paragraph (a) is a ground for rejection only if material delay or loss ensues.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2-505 Seller's Shipment Under Reservation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the seller's procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his or her own order or otherwise reserves in the seller a security interest in the goods.  His or her procurement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller's expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) a non-negotiable bill of lading to the seller or his or her nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (subsection (2) of Section 2-507) a non-negotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession or control of the bill of lading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract nor the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.

(1) Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) if it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment is under reservation (Section 2-505);  but
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the buyer
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) on his or her receipt of possession or control of a negotiable document of title covering the goods;  or
<br>

(c) after his or her receipt of possession or control of a non-negotiable document of title or other direction to deliver in a record, as provided in subsection (4)(b) of Section 2-503.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In any case not within subsection (1) or (2), the risk of loss passes to the buyer on his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant;  otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on tender of delivery.
<br>

(b) if the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this Article (subsection (3) of Section 2-711), he is under a duty after rejection to hold them with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them;  but

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Subject to any security interest in the buyer (subsection (3) of Section 2-711), when the seller has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection a merchant buyer is under a duty after rejection of goods in his possession or control to follow any reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to the goods and in the absence of such instructions to make reasonable efforts to sell them for the seller's account if they are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily.  Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.

(2) When the buyer sells goods under subsection (1), he is entitled to reimbursement from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent on the gross proceeds.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired.  When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.

(1) An "installment contract'' is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause "each delivery is a separate contract'' or its equivalent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The buyer may reject any installment which is non-conforming if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the non-conformity is a defect in the required documents;  but if the non-conformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Whenever non-conformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole.  But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-conforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.  A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.

(4) Where a seller has received payment in goods their reasonable value or the proceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection (2);  but if the seller has notice of the buyer's breach before reselling goods received in part performance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this Article on resale by an aggrieved seller (Section 2-706).

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section and of the preceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this Article, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of non-conforming goods or parts;  and

(b) resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.

(2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.  Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.

(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price (Section 2-708 or Section 2-713) shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued.  By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach.  A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the court as a matter of law finds a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the lease contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the lease contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.

(2) With respect to a consumer lease, if the court as a matter of law finds that a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract has been induced by unconscionable conduct or that unconscionable conduct has occurred in the collection of a claim arising from a lease contract, the court may grant appropriate relief.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Before making a finding of unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court, on its own motion or that of a party, shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the lease contract or clause thereof, or of the conduct.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b), whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods shown in the writing.

(a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for lease or sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor's business, and the lessor, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the lessee, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) with respect to goods that have been received and accepted by the lessee.

(5) The lease term under a lease contract referred to in subsection (4) is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) if there is a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent specifying the lease term, the term so specified;
<br>

(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court a lease term, the term so admitted;  or

(1) The benefit of a supplier's promises to the lessor under the supply contract and of all warranties, whether express or implied, including those of any third party provided in connection with or as part of the supply contract, extends to the lessee to the extent of the lessee's leasehold interest under a finance lease related to the supply contract, but is subject to the terms of the warranty and of the supply contract and all defenses or claims arising therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The extension of the benefit of a supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee (Section 2A-209(1)) does not:  (i) modify the rights and obligations of the parties to the supply contract, whether arising therefrom or otherwise, or (ii) impose any duty or liability under the supply contract on the lessee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any modification or rescission of the supply contract by the supplier and the lessor is effective between the supplier and the lessee unless, before the modification or rescission, the supplier has received notice that the lessee has entered into a finance lease related to the supply contract.  If the modification or rescission is effective between the supplier and the lessee, the lessor is deemed to have assumed, in addition to the obligations of the lessor to the lessee under the lease contract, promises of the supplier to the lessor and warranties that were so modified or rescinded as they existed and were available to the lessee before modification or rescission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In addition to the extension of the benefit of the supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee under subsection (1), the lessee retains all rights that the lessee may have against the supplier which arise from an agreement between the lessee and the supplier or under other law.

(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the lessor to the lessee which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the affirmation or promise.

(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the description.

(c) Any sample or model that is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to the sample or model.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as "warrant'' or "guarantee,'' or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention "merchantability'', be by a writing, and be conspicuous.  Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and be conspicuous.  Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous and states, for example, "There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose''.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2A-216 Third-Party Beneficiaries of Express and Implied Warranties. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this Article, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of the lessee or who is a guest in the lessee's home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty.  This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons.  The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this section.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A lessee obtains an insurable interest when existing goods are identified to the lease contract even though the goods identified are nonconforming and the lessee has an option to reject them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If a lessee has an insurable interest only by reason of the lessor's identification of the goods, the lessor, until default or insolvency or notification to the lessee that identification is final, may substitute other goods for those identified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Notwithstanding a lessee's insurable interest under subsections (1) and (2), the lessor retains an insurable interest until an option to buy has been exercised by the lessee and risk of loss has passed to the lessee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2A-219 Risk of Loss. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Except in the case of a finance lease, risk of loss is retained by the lessor and does not pass to the lessee.  In the case of a finance lease, risk of loss passes to the lessee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subject to the provisions of this Article on the effect of default on risk of loss (Section 2A-220), if risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the lease contract requires or authorizes the goods to be shipped by carrier
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) and it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier;  but
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) if it does require delivery at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the lessee on acknowledgment by the bailee of the lessee's right to possession of the goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In any case not within subsection (a) or (b), the risk of loss passes to the lessee on the lessee's receipt of the goods if the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, is a merchant;  otherwise the risk passes to the lessee on tender of delivery.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Where risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or acceptance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as having remained with the lessor from the beginning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage may treat the risk of loss as resting on the lessee for a commercially reasonable time.

If a lease contract requires goods identified when the lease contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of the lessee, the lessor or the supplier before delivery, or the goods suffer casualty before risk of loss passes to the lessee pursuant to the lease agreement or Section 2A-219, then:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) if the loss is total, the lease contract is avoided;  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as to no longer conform to the lease contract, the lessee may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the lease contract as avoided or, except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, accept the goods with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the lessor.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) As used in this section, "creation of a security interest'' includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to Article 9, Secured Transactions, by reason of Section 9-109(a)(3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) and Section 9-407, a provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy, or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the rights and remedies provided in subsection (4), but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's entire obligation, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection (4).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Subject to subsection (3) and Section 9-407:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) if a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in Section 2A-501(2);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if paragraph (a) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that (i) is prohibited under a lease agreement or (ii) materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract, (i) the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A transfer of "the lease'' or of "all my rights under the lease'', or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee.  Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties.  The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous.

(1) Subject to Section 2A-303, a subsequent lessee from a lessor of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessor had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (2) and Section 2A-527(4), takes subject to the existing lease contract.  A lessor with voidable title has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith subsequent lessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence.  If goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase, the lessor has that power even though:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the lessor's transferor was deceived as to the identity of the lessor;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A subsequent lessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessor who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the existing lessee of that lessor before the interest of the subsequent lessee became enforceable against that lessor obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, all of that lessor's and the existing lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A subsequent lessee from the lessor of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2A-309 Lessor's and Lessee's Rights When Goods Become Fixtures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) goods are "fixtures'' when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) a "fixture filing'' is the filing, in the office where a record of a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded, of a financing statement covering goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of Section 9-502(a) and (b);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) a lease is a "purchase money lease'' unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreement is enforceable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) a mortgage is a "construction mortgage'' to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) "encumbrance'' includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Under this Article a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this Article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) This Article does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within ten days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The interest of a lessor of fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures the lease contract is enforceable;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) the conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) the encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) the lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.  If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Notwithstanding subsection (4)(a) but otherwise subject to subsections (4) and (5), the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction.  To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this Article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this Article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them.  A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Goods are "accessions'' when they are installed in or affixed to other goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into before the goods became accessions is superior to all interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into at the time or after the goods became accessions is superior to all subsequently acquired interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4) but is subordinate to interests in the whole existing at the time the lease contract was made unless the holders of such interests in the whole have in writing consented to the lease or disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole.
<br>

(4) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract described in subsection (2) or (3) is subordinate to the interest of

(a) a buyer in the ordinary course of business or a lessee in the ordinary course of business of any interest in the whole acquired after the goods became accessions;  or

(5) When under subsections (2) or (3) and (4) a lessor or a lessee of accessions holds an interest that is superior to all interests in the whole, the lessor or the lessee may (a) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease contract by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease contract and this Article, or (b) if necessary to enforce his other rights and remedies under this Article, remove the goods from the whole, free and clear of all interests in the whole, but he must reimburse any holder of an interest in the whole who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them.  A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A lease contract imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assurance of due performance.  Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable the insecure party may suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A repudiation of the lease contract occurs if assurance of due performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is not provided to the insecure party within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days after receipt of a demand by the other party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Between merchants, the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered must be determined according to commercial standards.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2A-402 Anticipatory Repudiation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If either party repudiates a lease contract with respect to a performance not yet due under the lease contract, the loss of which performance will substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the other, the aggrieved party may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) for a commercially reasonable time, await retraction of repudiation and performance by the repudiating party;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) make demand pursuant to Section 2A-401 and await assurance of future performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) resort to any right or remedy upon default under the lease contract or this Article, even though the aggrieved party has notified the repudiating party that the aggrieved party would await the repudiating party's performance and assurance and has urged retraction.  In addition, whether or not the aggrieved party is pursuing one of the foregoing remedies, the aggrieved party may suspend performance or, if the aggrieved party is the lessor, proceed in accordance with the provisions of this Article on the lessor's right to identify goods to the lease contract notwithstanding default or to salvage unfinished goods (Section 2A-524).

(a) Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a lessor or a supplier who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a default under the lease contract if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the lease contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order, whether or not the regulation or order later proves to be invalid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only part of the lessor's or the supplier's capacity to perform, he shall allocate production and deliveries among his customers but at his option may include regular customers not then under contract for sale or lease as well as his own requirements for further manufacture.  He may so allocate in any manner that is fair and reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The lessor seasonably shall notify the lessee and in the case of a finance lease the supplier seasonably shall notify the lessor and the lessee, if known, that there will be delay or nondelivery and, if allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the lessee.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement has rights and remedies as provided in this Article and, except as limited by this Article, as provided in the lease agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement may reduce the party's claim to judgment, or otherwise enforce the lease contract by self-help or any available judicial procedure or nonjudicial procedure, including administrative proceeding, arbitration, or the like, in accordance with this Article.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Damages payable by either party for default, or any other act or omission, including indemnity for loss or diminution of anticipated tax benefits or loss or damage to lessor's residual interest, may be liquidated in the lease agreement but only at an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the then anticipated harm caused by the default or other act or omission.

(2) If the lease agreement provides for liquidation of damages, and such provision does not comply with subsection (1), or such provision is an exclusive or limited remedy that circumstances cause to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the lessor justifiably withholds or stops delivery of goods because of the lessee's default or insolvency (Section 2A-525 or 2A-526), the lessee is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the amount to which the lessor is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the lessor's damages in accordance with subsection (1);  or

(3) Evidence of a relevant rent prevailing at a time or place or for a lease term other than the one described in this Article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party notice the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the lessee, after rejection of goods in the lessee's possession, shall hold them with reasonable care at the lessor's or the supplier's disposition for a reasonable time after the lessee's seasonable notification of rejection;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if the lessor or the supplier gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection, the lessee may store the rejected goods for the lessor's or the supplier's account or ship them to the lessor or the supplier or dispose of them for the lessor's or the supplier's account with reimbursement in the manner provided in Section 2A-511;  but

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If any tender or delivery by the lessor or the supplier is rejected because nonconforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the lessor or the supplier may seasonably notify the lessee of the lessor's or the supplier's intention to cure and may then make a conforming delivery within the time provided in the lease contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the lessee rejects a nonconforming tender that the lessor or the supplier had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance, the lessor or the supplier may have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender if he seasonably notifies the lessee.

(a) if, stated seasonably, the lessor or the supplier could have cured it (Section 2A-513);  or
<br>

(b) between merchants if the lessor or the supplier after rejection has made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the lessee proposes to rely.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A lessee's failure to reserve rights when paying rent or other consideration against documents precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent in the documents.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Acceptance of goods occurs after the lessee has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the lessee signifies or acts with respect to the goods in a manner that signifies to the lessor or the supplier that the goods are conforming or that the lessee will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) the lessee fails to make an effective rejection of the goods (Section 2A-509(2)).

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A lessee must pay rent for any goods accepted in accordance with the lease contract, with due allowance for goods rightfully rejected or not delivered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A lessee's acceptance of goods precludes rejection of the goods accepted.  In the case of a finance lease, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it.  In any other case, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured.  Acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this Article or the lease agreement for nonconformity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If a tender has been accepted:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered any default, the lessee shall notify the lessor and the supplier, if any, or be barred from any remedy against the party not notified;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) except in the case of a consumer lease, within a reasonable time after the lessee receives notice of litigation for infringement or the like (Section 2A-211) the lessee shall notify the lessor or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) the burden is on the lessee to establish any default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If a lessee is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which a lessor or a supplier is answerable over the following apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The lessee may give the lessor or the supplier, or both, written notice of the litigation.  If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that if the person notified does not do so that person will be bound in any action against that person by the lessee by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the person notified after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend that person is so bound.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The lessor or the supplier may demand in writing that the lessee turn over control of the litigation including settlement if the claim is one for infringement or the like (Section 2A-211) or else be barred from any remedy over.  If the demand states that the lessor or the supplier agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the lessee after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the lessee is so barred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Subsections (3) and (4) apply to any obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or the supplier harmless against infringement or the like (Section 2A-211).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2A-517 Revocation of Acceptance of Goods. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the lessee if the lessee has accepted it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) except in the case of a finance lease, on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) without discovery of the nonconformity if the lessee's acceptance was reasonably induced either by the lessor's assurances or, except in the case of a finance lease, by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, a lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit if the lessor defaults under the lease contract and the default substantially impairs the value of that lot or commercial unit to the lessee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the lease agreement so provides, the lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit because of other defaults by the lessor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by the nonconformity.  Revocation is not effective until the lessee notifies the lessor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A lessee who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if the lessee had rejected them.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After a default by a lessor under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-508(1), or, if agreed, after other default by the lessor, the lessee may cover by making any purchase or lease of or contract to purchase or lease goods in substitution for those due from the lessor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Sections 1-302 and 2A-503), if a lessee's cover is by a lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessee may recover from the lessor as damages (i) the present value, as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, and (ii) any incidental or consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If a lessee's cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (2), or is by purchase or otherwise, the lessee may recover from the lessor as if the lessee had elected not to cover and Section 2A-519 governs.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Sections 1-302 and 2A-503), if a lessee elects not to cover or a lessee elects to cover and the cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section 2A-518(2), or is by purchase or otherwise, the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the lessor or for rejection or revocation of acceptance by the lessee is the present value, as of the date of the default, of the then market rent minus the present value as of the same date of the original rent, computed for the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Market rent is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Except as otherwise agreed, if the lessee has accepted goods and given notification (Section 2A-516(3)), the measure of damages for nonconforming tender or delivery or other default by a lessor is the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessor's default as determined in any manner that is reasonable together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Except as otherwise agreed, the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the present value at the time and place of acceptance of the difference between the value of the use of the goods accepted and the value if they had been as warranted for the lease term, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default or breach of warranty.

(a) cancel the lease contract (Section 2A-505(1));
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) proceed respecting goods not identified to the lease contract (Section 2A-524);

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Sections 1-302 and 2A-503), if the disposition is by lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, (ii) the present value, as of the same date, of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value, as of the same date, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.

(1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Sections 1-302 and 2A-503), if a lessor elects to retain the goods or a lessor elects to dispose of the goods and the disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section 2A-527(2), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages for a default of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a), or, if agreed, for other default of the lessee, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of default if the lessee has never taken possession of the goods, or, if the lessee has taken possession of the goods, as of the date the lessor repossesses the goods or an earlier date on which the lessee makes a tender of the goods to the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the date determined under clause (i) of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the market rent at the place where the goods are located computed for the same lease term, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put a lessor in as good a position as performance would have, the measure of damages is the present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance by the lessee, together with any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of disposition.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2A-529 Lessor's Action for the Rent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, if the lessor complies with subsection (2), the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) for goods accepted by the lessee and not repossessed by or tendered to the lessor, and for conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of loss passes to the lessee (Section 2A-219), (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) for goods identified to the lease contract if the lessor is unable after reasonable effort to dispose of them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that effort will be unavailing, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), the lessor shall hold for the lessee for the remaining lease term of the lease agreement any goods that have been identified to the lease contract and are in the lessor's control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The lessor may dispose of the goods at any time before collection of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1).  If the disposition is before the end of the remaining lease term of the lease agreement, the lessor's recovery against the lessee for damages is governed by Section 2A-527 or Section 2A-528, and the lessor will cause an appropriate credit to be provided against a judgment for damages to the extent that the amount of the judgment exceeds the recovery available pursuant to Section 2A-527 or 2A-528.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Payment of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1) entitles the lessee to the use and possession of the goods not then disposed of for the remaining lease term of and in accordance with the lease agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or Section 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, a lessor who is held not entitled to rent under this section must nevertheless be awarded damages for non-acceptance under Section 2A-527 or Section 2A-528.

(1) If a third party so deals with goods that have been identified to a lease contract as to cause actionable injury to a party to the lease contract
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the lessor has a right of action against the third party;  and

(i) has a security interest in the goods;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) has an insurable interest in the goods;  or

(2) If at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the lease contract and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement, subject to his own interest, is as a fiduciary for the other party to the lease contract.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-104 Negotiable Instrument. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument'' means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) is payable on demand or at a definite time;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Instrument'' means a negotiable instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check'' in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An instrument is a "note'' if it is a promise and is a "draft'' if it is an order.  If an instrument falls within the definition of both "note'' and "draft,'' a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) "Check'' means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank, (ii) a cashier's check or teller's check, or (iii) a demand draft.  An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as "money order.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) "Cashier's check'' means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) "Teller's check'' means a draft drawn by a bank (i) on another bank, or (ii) payable at or through a bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) "Traveler's check'' means an instrument that (i) is payable on demand, (ii) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, (iii) is designated by the term "traveler's check'' or by a substantially similar term, and (iv) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) "Certificate of deposit'' means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money.  A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) "Demand draft'' means a writing not signed by a customer that is created by a third party under the purported authority of the customer for the purpose of charging the customer's account with a bank.  A demand draft shall contain the customer's account number and may contain any or all of the following:  (i) the customer's printed or typewritten name, (ii) a notation that the customer authorized the draft, or (iii) the statement "No Signature Required'' or words to that effect.  A demand draft shall not include a check purportedly drawn by and bearing the signature of a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3-307(a)(1).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-105 Issue of Instrument. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) "Issue'' means the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense.  An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Issuer'' applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-106 Unconditional Promise or Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as provided in this section, for the purposes of Section 3-104(a), a promise or order is unconditional unless it states (i) an express condition to payment, (ii) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) that rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing.  A reference to another writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A promise or order is not made conditional (i) by a reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of Section 3-104(a).  If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of Section 3-104(a);  but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-110 Identification of Person to Whom Instrument is Payable. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument.  The instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person.  If more than one person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by one or more of the signers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number, office, or account number.  For the purpose of determining the holder of an instrument, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If an instrument is payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument is payable to the person to whom the account is payable.  If an instrument is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the owner of the account identified by number.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If an instrument is payable to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) a trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether or not the beneficiary or estate is also named;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) a person described as agent or similar representative of a named or identified person, the instrument is payable to the represented person, the representative, or a successor of the representative;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) a fund or organization that is not a legal entity, the instrument is payable to a representative of the members of the fund or organization;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) an office or to a person described as holding an office, the instrument is payable to the named person, the incumbent of the office, or a successor to the incumbent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If an instrument is payable to two or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession of the instrument.  If an instrument is payable to two or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them.

(a) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a "special indorsement.''  When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person.  The principles stated in Section 3-110 apply to special indorsements.

(b) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a "blank indorsement.''  When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument.  A person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or takes it for collection when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A payor bank that is also the depositary bank or that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the indorsement and is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are not received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Except for an indorsement covered by subsection (c), if an instrument bears an indorsement using words to the effect that payment is to be made to the indorsee as agent, trustee, or other fiduciary for the benefit of the indorser or another person, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty as provided in Section 3-307, a person who purchases the instrument from the indorsee or takes the instrument from the indorsee for collection or payment may pay the proceeds of payment or the value given for the instrument to the indorsee without regard to whether the indorsee violates a fiduciary duty to the indorser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A subsequent transferee of the instrument or person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by the restriction in the indorsement unless the transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The presence on an instrument of an indorsement to which this section applies does not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under subsection (c) or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty as stated in subsection (d).
<br>

(1) the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the holder took the instrument (i) for value, (ii) in good faith, (iii) without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series, (iv) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered, (v) without notice of any claim to the instrument described in Section 3-306, and (vi) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in Section 3-305(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a defense under subsection (a), but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge.  Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken (i) by legal process or by purchase in an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor's sale or similar proceeding, (ii) by purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business of the transferor, or (iii) as the successor in interest to an estate or other organization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If, under Section 3-303(a)(1), the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has been partially performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised performance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If (i) the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the instrument and (ii) the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity to act on it.

(3) If a due date with respect to principal has been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on the day after the accelerated due date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless the due date of principal has been accelerated, an instrument does not become overdue if there is default in payment of interest but no default in payment of principal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-305 Defenses and Claims in Recoupment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as stated in subsection (b), the right to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a defense of the obligor based on (i) infancy of the obligor to the extent it is a defense to a simple contract, (ii) duress, lack of legal capacity, or illegality of the transaction which, under other law, nullifies the obligation of the obligor, (iii) fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms, or (iv) discharge of the obligor in insolvency proceedings;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a defense of the obligor stated in another section of this Article or a defense of the obligor that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) a claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument;  but the claim of the obligor may be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The right of a holder in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (a)(1), but is not subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (a)(2) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection (a)(3) against a person other than the holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except as stated in subsection (d), in an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor may not assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument (Section 3-306) of another person, but the other person's claim to the instrument may be asserted by the obligor if the other person is joined in the action and personally asserts the claim against the person entitled to enforce the instrument.  An obligor is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the instrument does not have rights of a holder in due course and the obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the accommodation party may assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under subsection (a) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy, and lack of legal capacity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-307 Notice of Breach of Fiduciary Duty. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Fiduciary'' means an agent, trustee, partner, corporate officer or director, or other representative owing a fiduciary duty with respect to an instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Represented person'' means the principal, beneficiary, partnership, corporation, or other person to whom the duty stated in paragraph (1) is owed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If (i) an instrument is taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection or for value, (ii) the taker has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, and (iii) the represented person makes a claim to the instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Notice of breach of fiduciary duty by the fiduciary is notice of the claim of the represented person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In the case of an instrument payable to the represented person or the fiduciary as such, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (i) taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary, (ii) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (iii) deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, and made payable to the fiduciary personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach of fiduciary duty unless the taker knows of the breach of fiduciary duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, to the taker as payee, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (i) taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary, (ii) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (iii) deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-308 Proof of Signatures and Status as Holder in Due Course. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings.  If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature.  If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under Section 3-402(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection (a), a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under Section 3-301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment.  If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-309 Enforcement of Lost, Destroyed, or Stolen Instrument. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (1) the person seeking to enforce the instrument (A) was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred, or (B) has directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the instrument from a person who was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred;  (2) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure;  and (3) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection (a) must prove the terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument.  If that proof is made, Section 3-308 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument.  The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument.  Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-310 Effect of Instrument on Obligation for Which Taken. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Unless otherwise agreed, if a certified check, cashier's check, or teller's check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation.  Discharge of the obligation does not affect any liability that the obligor may have as an indorser of the instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless otherwise agreed and except as provided in subsection (a), if a note or an uncertified check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken, and the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In the case of an uncertified check, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or until it is paid or certified.  Payment or certification of the check results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the amount of the check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In the case of a note, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid.  Payment of the note results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (4), if the check or note is dishonored and the obligee of the obligation for which the instrument was taken is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligee may enforce either the instrument or the obligation.  In the case of an instrument of a third person which is negotiated to the obligee by the obligor, discharge of the obligor on the instrument also discharges the obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If the person entitled to enforce the instrument taken for an obligation is a person other than the obligee, the obligee may not enforce the obligation to the extent the obligation is suspended.  If the obligee is the person entitled to enforce the instrument but no longer has possession of it because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, the obligation may not be enforced to the extent of the amount payable on the instrument, and to that extent the obligee's rights against the obligor are limited to enforcement of the instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If an instrument other than one described in subsection (a) or (b) is taken for an obligation, the effect is (i) that stated in subsection (a) if the instrument is one on which a bank is liable as maker or acceptor, or (ii) that stated in subsection (b) in any other case.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-311 Accord and Satisfaction by Use of Instrument. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If a person against whom a claim is asserted proves that (i) that person in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute, and (iii) the claimant obtained payment of the instrument, the following subsections apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless subsection (c) applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subject to subsection (d), a claim is not discharged under subsection (b) if either of the following applies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The claimant, if an organization, proves that (i) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office, or place, and (ii) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received by that designated person, office, or place.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that within 90 days after payment of the instrument, the claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against whom the claim is asserted.  This paragraph does not apply if the claimant is an organization that sent a statement complying with paragraph (1)(i).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-312 Lost, Destroyed, or Stolen Cashier's Check, Teller's Check, or Certified Check. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Check'' means a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Claimant'' means a person who claims the right to receive the amount of a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check that was lost, destroyed, or stolen.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Declaration of loss'' means a written statement, made under penalty of perjury, to the effect that (i) the declarer lost possession of a check, (ii) the declarer is the drawer or payee of the check, in the case of a certified check, or the remitter or payee of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check, (iii) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the declarer or a lawful seizure, and (iv) the declarer cannot reasonably obtain possession of the check because the check was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) "Obligated bank'' means the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check or the acceptor of a certified check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A claimant may assert a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank describing the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of the check, if (i) the claimant is the drawer or payee of a certified check or the remitter or payee of a cashier's check or teller's check, (ii) the communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration of loss of the claimant with respect to the check, (iii) the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act on it before the check is paid, and (iv) the claimant provides reasonable identification if requested by the obligated bank.  Delivery of a declaration of loss is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration.  If a claim is asserted in compliance with this subsection, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The claim becomes enforceable at the later of (i) the time the claim is asserted, or (ii) the 90th day following the date of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check, or the 90th day following the date of the acceptance, in the case of a certified check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Until the claim becomes enforceable, it has no legal effect and the obligated bank may pay the check or, in the case of a teller's check, may permit the drawee to pay the check.  Payment to a person entitled to enforce the check discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the claim becomes enforceable before the check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not obliged to pay the check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) When the claim becomes enforceable, the obligated bank becomes obliged to pay the amount of the check to the claimant if payment of the check has not been made to a person entitled to enforce the check.  Subject to Section 4-302(a)(1), payment to the claimant discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the obligated bank pays the amount of a check to a claimant under subsection (b)(4) and the check is presented for payment by a person having rights of a holder in due course, the claimant is obliged to (i) refund the payment to the obligated bank if the check is paid, or (ii) pay the amount of the check to the person having rights of a holder in due course if the check is dishonored.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a claimant has the right to assert a claim under subsection (b) and is also a person entitled to enforce a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check which is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the claimant may assert rights with respect to the check either under this section or Section 3-309.

(a) If a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing either the name of the represented person or the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature to the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were on a simple contract.  If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the "authorized signature of the represented person'' and the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified in the instrument.

(b) If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the form of the signature shows unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the represented person who is identified in the instrument, the representative is not liable on the instrument.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subject to subsection (c), if (i) the form of the signature does not show unambiguously that the signature is made in a representative capacity or (ii) the represented person is not identified in the instrument, the representative is liable on the instrument to a holder in due course that took the instrument without notice that the representative was not intended to be liable on the instrument.  With respect to any other person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that the original parties did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a representative signs the name of the representative as drawer of a check without indication of the representative status and the check is payable from an account of the represented person who is identified on the check, the signer is not liable on the check if the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Employee'' includes an independent contractor and employee of an independent contractor retained by the employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Fraudulent indorsement'' means (i) in the case of an instrument payable to the employer, a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the employer, or (ii) in the case of an instrument with respect to which the employer is the issuer, a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the person identified as payee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) "Responsibility'' with respect to instruments means authority (i) to sign or indorse instruments on behalf of the employer, (ii) to process instruments received by the employer for bookkeeping purposes, for deposit to an account, or for other disposition, (iii) to prepare or process instruments for issue in the name of the employer, (iv) to supply information determining the names or addresses of payees of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, (v) to control the disposition of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, or (vi) to act otherwise with respect to instruments in a responsible capacity.  "Responsibility'' does not include authority that merely allows an employee to have access to instruments or blank or incomplete instrument forms that are being stored or transported or are part of incoming or outgoing mail, or similar access.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a person who, in good faith, pays an instrument or takes it for value or for collection, if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in the name of that person.  If the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-407 Alteration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) "Alteration'' means (i) an unauthorized change in an instrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party, or (ii) an unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), an alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration.  No other alteration discharges a party, and the instrument may be enforced according to its original terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A payor bank or drawee paying a fraudulently altered instrument or a person taking it for value, in good faith and without notice of the alteration, may enforce rights with respect to the instrument (i) according to its original terms, or (ii) in the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed.

<codesect>
(a) "Acceptance'' means the drawee's signed agreement to pay a draft as presented.  It must be written on the draft and may consist of the drawee's signature alone.  Acceptance may be made at any time and becomes effective when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted draft is delivered for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.

(c) If a draft is payable at a fixed period after sight and the acceptor fails to date the acceptance, the holder may complete the acceptance by supplying a date in good faith.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Certified check'' means a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn.  Acceptance may be made as stated in subsection (a) or by a writing on the check which indicates that the check is certified.  The drawee of a check has no obligation to certify the check, and refusal to certify is not dishonor of the check.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Expenses or consequential damages under subsection (b) are not recoverable if the refusal of the obligated bank to pay occurs because (i) the bank suspends payments, (ii) the obligated bank asserts a claim or defense of the bank that it has reasonable grounds to believe is available against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, (iii) the obligated bank has a reasonable doubt whether the person demanding payment is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, or (iv) payment is prohibited by law.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a draft is accepted and the acceptor is not a bank, the obligation of the drawer to pay the draft if the draft is dishonored by the acceptor is the same as the obligation of an indorser under Section 3-415(a) and (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) all signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which can be asserted against the warrantor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The warranties stated in subsection (a) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks.  Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection (b) is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.

In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.  The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment.  If the drawee accepts the draft, breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor.  If the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) based on an unauthorized indorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective under Section 3-404 or 3-405 or the drawer is precluded under Section 3-406 or 4-406 from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If (i) a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or (ii) any other instrument is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the instrument, and (iii) payment is received, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The person making payment may recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The warranties stated in subsections (a) and (d) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks.  Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection (b) or (d) is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Rights of the drawee under this subsection are not affected by failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in paying or accepting the draft.
<br>

(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), if an instrument has been paid or accepted by mistake and the case is not covered by subsection (a), the person paying or accepting may, to the extent permitted by the law governing mistake and restitution, (i) recover the payment from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made or (ii) in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.

(a) If an instrument is issued for value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument ("accommodated party'') and another party to the instrument ("accommodation party'') signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party "for accommodation.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An accommodation party may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor, or indorser and, subject to subsection (d), is obliged to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs.  The obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for the accommodation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to the instrument.  Except as provided in Section 3-605, the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if (i) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied, (ii) the other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding, (iii) the other party cannot be served with process, or (iv) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party.  An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.

(3) If a draft is payable on a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if (i) presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later, or (ii) presentment for acceptance is duly made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If a draft is payable on elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance, the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance is duly made and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.

(d) Dishonor of an accepted draft is governed by the following rules:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the draft is not payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In any case in which presentment is otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused under Section 3-504, dishonor occurs without presentment if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subject to Section 3-504(c), with respect to an instrument taken for collection by a collecting bank, notice of dishonor must be given (i) by the bank before midnight of the next banking day following the banking day on which the bank receives notice of dishonor of the instrument, or (ii) by any other person within 30 days following the day on which the person receives notice of dishonor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:3-605 Discharge of Indorsers and Accommodation Parties. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In this section, the term "indorser'' includes a drawer having the obligation described in Section 3-414(d).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Discharge, under Section 3-604, of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the discharged party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension discharges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the extent the indorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.  The loss suffered by the indorser or accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is secured by an interest in collateral and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment.  The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent (i) the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse of the party asserting discharge, or (ii) the reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the interest.  The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of any party who is jointly and severally liable with respect to the secured obligation is discharged to the extent the impairment causes the party asserting discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to pay, taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had not occurred.  If the party asserting discharge is an accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection (e), the party is deemed to have a right to contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a right to reimbursement.  The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Under subsection (e) or (f), impairing value of an interest in collateral includes (i) failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral, (ii) release of collateral without substitution of collateral of equal value, (iii) failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of collateral owed, under Article 9 or other law, to a debtor or surety or other person secondarily liable, or (iv) failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) An accommodation party is not discharged under subsection (c), (d), or (e) unless the person entitled to enforce the instrument knows of the accommodation or has notice under Section 3-419(c) that the instrument was signed for accommodation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A party is not discharged under this section if (i) the party asserting discharge consents to the event or conduct that is the basis of the discharge, or (ii) the instrument or a separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section either specifically or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The specification or approval of certain procedures by this Article is not disapproval of other procedures that may be reasonable under the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care.  If there is also bad faith it includes any other damages the party suffered as a proximate consequence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4-201 Status of Collecting Bank as Agent and Provisional Status of Credits;  Applicability of Article;  Item Indorsed "Pay Any Bank''. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Unless a contrary intent clearly appears and before the time that a settlement given by a collecting bank for an item is or becomes final, the bank, with respect to an item, is an agent or sub-agent of the owner of the item and any settlement given for the item is provisional.  This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn;  but the continuance of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of recoupment or setoff.  If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this Article apply even though action of the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) After an item has been indorsed with the words "pay any bank'' or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) returned to the customer initiating collection;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit within a reasonable time after discovery thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A collecting bank exercises ordinary care under subsection (a) by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following receipt of an item, notice, or settlement.  Taking proper action within a reasonably longer time may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of establishing timeliness.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) all signatures on the item are authentic and authorized;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment (Section 3-305(a)) of any party that can be asserted against the warrantor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) the warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) if the item is a demand draft, creation of the item according to the terms on its face was authorized by the person identified as drawer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If an item is dishonored, a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item (i) according to the terms of the item at the time it was transferred, or (ii) if the transfer was of an incomplete item, according to its terms when completed as stated in Sections 3-115 and 3-407.  The obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith.  A transferor cannot disclaim its obligation under this subsection by an indorsement stating that it is made "without recourse'' or otherwise disclaiming liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person to whom the warranties under subsection (a) are made and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a result of the breach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The warranties stated in subsection (a) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks.  Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the warranty in paragraph (6) of subsection (a) is not given by a transferor or collecting bank under applicable conflict of law rules, then the warranty is not given to that transferor when that transferor is a transferee nor to any prior collecting bank of that transferee.

(b) A drawee making payment may recover from a warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer because of the payment.  In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.  The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment.  If the drawee accepts the draft (i) breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor, and (ii) if the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from a warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) based on an unauthorized indorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective under Section 3-404 or 3-405 or the drawer is precluded under Section 3-406 or 4-406 from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If (i) a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or (ii) any other item is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the item, and the item is paid, the person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the item warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the item, a person entitled to enforce the item or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the item.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The warranties stated in subsections (a) and (d) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks.  Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
<br>

(f) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A demand draft is a check, as provided in Section 3-104(f).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) If the warranty in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) is not given by a transferor under applicable conflict of law rules, then the warranty is not given to that transferor when that transferor is a transferee.

(a) A collecting bank has a security interest in an item and any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in case of an item deposited in an account, to the extent to which credit given for the item has been withdrawn or applied;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if it makes an advance on or against the item.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If credit given for several items received at one time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or applied in part, the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either.  For the purpose of this section, credits first given are first withdrawn.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Receipt by a collecting bank of a final settlement for an item is a realization on its security interest in the item, accompanying documents, and proceeds.  So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or possession or control of the accompanying documents for purposes other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to Article 9, but:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) no security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable (Section 9-203(b)(3)(A));
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) no filing is required to perfect the security interest;  and

<codesect>
(a) If a collecting bank has made provisional settlement with its customer for an item and fails by reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a bank, or otherwise to receive settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer's account, or obtain refund from its customer, whether or not it is able to return the item, if by its midnight deadline or within a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends notification of the facts.  If the return or notice is delayed beyond the bank's midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts, the bank may revoke the settlement, charge back the credit, or obtain refund from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay.  These rights to revoke, charge back, and obtain refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final.
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A failure to charge back or claim refund does not affect other rights of the bank against the customer or any other party.
<br>

<center><h3>Section 382-A:4-401</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4-401 When Bank May Charge Customer's Account. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A bank may charge against the account of a customer an item that is properly payable from the account even though the charge creates an overdraft.  An item is properly payable if it is authorized by the customer and is in accordance with any agreement between the customer and bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A customer is not liable for the amount of an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor benefited from the proceeds of the item.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A bank may charge against the account of a customer a check that is otherwise properly payable from the account, even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless the customer has given notice to the bank of the postdating describing the check with reasonable certainty.  The notice is effective for the period stated in Section 4-403(b) for stop-payment orders, and must be received at such time and in such manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with respect to the check described in Section 4-303.  If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its act.  The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under Section 4-402.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A bank that in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer according to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the original terms of the altered item;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed unless the bank has notice that the completion was improper.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4-402 Bank's Liability to Customer for Wrongful Dishonor;  Time of Determining Insufficiency of Account. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a payor bank wrongfully dishonors an item if it dishonors an item that is properly payable, but a bank may dishonor an item that would create an overdraft unless it has agreed to pay the overdraft.  "Wrongful dishonor'' shall include, but not be limited to, a refusal by a payor bank to honor an item otherwise properly payable, if the payee presents the item in person to the payor bank, properly endorses the item and provides reasonably reliable identification confirming the payee's identity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A payor bank is liable to its customer for damages proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor of an item.  Liability is limited to actual damages proved and may include damages for an arrest or prosecution of the customer or other consequential damages.  Whether any consequential damages are proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor is a question of fact to be determined in each case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A payor bank's determination of the customer's account balance on which a decision to dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is based may be made at any time between the time the item is received by the payor bank and the time that the payor bank returns the item or gives notice in lieu of return, and no more than one determination need be made.  If, at the election of the payor bank, a subsequent balance determination is made for the purpose of reevaluating the bank's decision to dishonor the item, the account balance at that time is determinative of whether a dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is wrongful.

<codesect>
(a) A customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than one person may stop payment of any item drawn on the customer's account or close the account by an order to the bank describing the item or account with reasonable certainty received at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in Section 4-303.  If the signature of more than one person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A stop-payment order is effective for 6 months, but it lapses after 14 calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in writing within that period.  A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional 6-month periods by a writing given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer.  The loss from payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under Section 4-402.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4-406 Customer's Duty to Discover and Report Unauthorized Signature or Alteration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A bank that sends or makes available to a customer a statement of account showing payment of items for the account shall return or make available to the customer the items paid.  If the customer agrees, the bank may not provide the items, but shall provide information in the statement of account sufficient to allow customer reasonably to identify the items paid.  The statement of account provides sufficient information if the item is described by item number, amount, and date of payment.  If the bank does not return the items, it shall provide in the statement of account the telephone number that the customer may call to request an item or a legible copy thereof pursuant to subsection (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the items are not returned to the customer, the person retaining the items shall either retain the items or, if the items are destroyed, maintain the capacity to furnish legible copies of the items until the expiration of 7 years after receipt of the items.  A customer may request an item from the bank which paid the item, and that bank must provide in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost, either the item or, if the item has been destroyed or is not otherwise obtainable, a legible copy of the item.  A bank shall provide, upon request and without charge to the customer at least 10 items or a legible copy thereof with respect to each statement of account sent to the customer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a bank sends or makes available a statement of account or items pursuant to subsection (a), the customer must exercise reasonable promptness in examining the statement or the items to determine whether any payment was not authorized because of an alteration of an item or because a purported signature by or on behalf of the customer was not authorized.  If, based on the statement or items provided, the customer should reasonably have discovered the unauthorized payment, the customer must promptly notify the bank of the relevant facts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties imposed on the customer by subsection (c), the customer is precluded from asserting against the bank:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the customer's unauthorized signature or any alteration on the item, if the bank also proves that it suffered a loss by reason of the failure;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the customer's unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in good faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the customer of the unauthorized signature or alteration and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable period of time, not exceeding 30 days, in which to examine the item or statement of account and notify the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If subsection (d) applies and the customer proves that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, the loss is allocated between the customer precluded and the bank asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of the customer to comply with subsection (c) and the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.  If the customer proves that the bank did not pay the item in good faith, the preclusion under subsection (d) does not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not within one year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subsection (a)) discover and report the customer's unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration.  If there is a preclusion under this subsection, the payor bank may not recover for breach or warranty under Section 4-208 with respect to the unauthorized signature or alteration to which the preclusion applies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-106 Time Payment Order is Received. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The time of receipt of a payment order or communication cancelling or amending a payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice stated in Section 1-202.  A receiving bank may fix a cut-off time or times on a funds-transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications cancelling or amending payment orders.  Different cut-off times may apply to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments, or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments.  A cut-off time may apply to senders generally or different cut-off times may apply to different senders or categories of payment orders.  If a payment order or communication cancelling or amending a payment order is received after the close of a funds-transfer business day or after the appropriate cut-off time on a funds-transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order or communication as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business day.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If this Article refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds-transfer business day, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this Article.

<codesect>
"Security procedure'' means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication.  A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.  Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-202 Authorized and Verified Payment Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer.  The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.  A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The term "sender'' in this Article includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (a), or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Except as provided in this section and in Section 4A-203(a)(1), rights and obligations arising under this section or Section 4A-203 may not be varied by agreement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-203 Unenforceability of Certain Verified Payment Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If an accepted payment order is not, under Section 4A-202(a), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order of the customer pursuant to Section 4A-202(b), the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) By express written agreement, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (i) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or (ii) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault.  Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-204 Refund of Payment and Duty of Customer to Report With Respect to Unauthorized Payment Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If a receiving bank accepts a payment order issued in the name of its customer as sender which is (i) not authorized and not effective as the order of the customer under Section 4A-202, or (ii) not enforceable, in whole or in part, against the customer under Section 4A-203, the bank shall refund any payment of the payment order received from the customer to the extent the bank is not entitled to enforce payment and shall pay interest on the refundable amount calculated from the date the bank received payment to the date of the refund.  However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order.  The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the customer on account of a failure by the customer to give notification as stated in this section.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-205 Erroneous Payment Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If an accepted payment order was transmitted pursuant to a security procedure for the detection of error and the payment order (i) erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender, (ii) erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender, or (iii) was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the sender proves that the sender or a person acting on behalf of the sender pursuant to Section 4A-206 complied with the security procedure and that the error would have been detected if the receiving bank had also complied, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent stated in paragraphs (2) and (3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of an erroneous payment order described in clause (i) or (iii) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order and the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order described in clause (ii) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent the amount received by the beneficiary is greater than the amount intended by the sender.  In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If (i) the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (a) is not obliged to pay all or part of the order, and (ii) the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding 90 days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender.  If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is liable to the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-207 Misdescription of Beneficiary. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order.  The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer.  If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) is accepted, (ii) the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(1), the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary.  Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence.  The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In a case governed by subsection (b)(1), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c), the originator has the right to recover.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the right to recover.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-208 Misdescription of Intermediary Bank or Beneficiary's Bank. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons.  The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank.  The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (b)(1), as though the sender were a bank.  Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence.  The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons.  The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in Section 4A-302(a)(1).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-209 Acceptance of Payment Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Subject to subsection (d), a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order when it executes the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d), a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of the following times:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) when the bank (i) pays the beneficiary as stated in Section 4A-405(a) or 4A-405(b), or (ii) notifies the beneficiary of receipt of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has been credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with respect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of payment from the sender of the order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) when the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sender's order pursuant to Section 4A-403(a)(1) or 4A-403(a)(2);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the bank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered by a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment from the sender, unless the order was rejected before that time or is rejected within (i) one hour after that time, or (ii) one hour after the opening of the next business day of the sender following the payment date if that time is later.  If notice of rejection is received by the sender after the payment date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the payment date to the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not accepted, counting that day as an elapsed day.  If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest payable is reduced accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Acceptance of a payment order cannot occur before the order is received by the receiving bank.  Acceptance does not occur under subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) if the beneficiary of the payment order does not have an account with the receiving bank, the account has been closed, or the receiving bank is not permitted by law to receive credits for the beneficiary's account.
<br>

(d) A payment order issued to the originator's bank cannot be accepted until the payment date if the bank is the beneficiary's bank, or the execution date if the bank is not the beneficiary's bank.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-210 Rejection of Payment Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing.  A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order.  Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances.  If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received.  If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order.  If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to Section 4A-211(d) or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day.  If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order.  Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-211 Cancellation and Amendment of Payment Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writing.  If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the sender cancelling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order (i) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, (ii) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator, or (iii) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator.  If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted.  If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance.  Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (c)(2).

<codesect>
If a receiving bank fails to accept a payment order that it is obliged by express agreement to accept, the bank is liable for breach of the agreement to the extent provided in the agreement or in this Article, but does not otherwise have any duty to accept a payment order or, before acceptance, to take any action, or refrain from taking action, with respect to the order except as provided in this Article or by express agreement.  Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in Section 4A-209, and liability is limited to that provided in this Article.  A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this Article or by express agreement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-301 Execution and Execution Date. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A payment order is "executed'' by the receiving bank when it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by the bank.  A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Execution date'' of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order.  The execution date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received.  If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-302 Obligations of Receiving Bank in Execution of Payment Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) through (d), if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to Section 4A-209(a), the bank has the following obligations in executing the order:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning (i) any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or (ii) the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer.  If the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator.  An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly.  If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may (i) use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances, and (ii) issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank.  A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless subsection (a)(2) applies or the receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances.  If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by transmitting its payment order by a particular means, the receiving bank may issue its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Unless instructed by the sender, (i) the receiving bank may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges, and (ii) may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-303 Erroneous Execution of Payment Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A receiving bank that (i) executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount greater than the amount of the sender's order, or (ii) issues a payment order in execution of the sender's order and then issues a duplicate order, is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under Section 4A-402(c) if that subsection is otherwise satisfied.  The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under Section 4A-402(c) if (i) that subsection is otherwise satisfied and (ii) the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order.  If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order.  This subsection does not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses pursuant to instruction of the sender.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they issued.  The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

<codesect>
If the sender of a payment order that is erroneously executed as stated in Section 4A-303 receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was executed or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care to determine, on the basis of information available to the sender, that the order was erroneously executed and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the notification from the bank was received by the sender.  If the sender fails to perform that duty, the bank is not obliged to pay interest on any amount refundable to the sender under Section 4A-402(d) for the period before the bank learns of the execution error.  The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the sender on account of a failure by the sender to perform the duty stated in this section.

<codesect>
(a) If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution.  Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in (i) noncompletion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (iii) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (a), resulting from the improper execution.  Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b), damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute.  Additional damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank, but are not otherwise recoverable.
<br>

(e) Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (a) or (b) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.

<codesect>
(a) This section is subject to Sections 4A-205 and 4A-207.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) With respect to a payment order issued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the payment date of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) This subsection is subject to subsection (e) and to Section 4A-303.  With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order.  Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order.  The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay.  Except as provided in Sections 4A-204 and 4A-304, interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection (c) and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection (d) but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in Section 4A-302(a)(1), to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted.  The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection (d).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-403 Payment by Sender to Receiving Bank. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Payment of the sender's obligation under Section 4A-402 to pay the receiving bank occurs as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a Federal Reserve Bank or through a funds-transfer system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the sender is a bank and the sender (i) credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender, or (ii) caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system.  The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system.  The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system.  The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If two banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under Section 4A-402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank.  To the extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In a case not covered by subsection (a), the time when payment of the sender's obligation under Section 4A-402(b) or 4A-402(c) occurs is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.

<codesect>
(a) Subject to Sections 4A-211(e), 4A-405(d), and 4A-405(e), if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order.  Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day.  If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date.  If the payment order does not instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order.  Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances.  If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank.  No other damages are recoverable.  Reasonable attorney's fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection (a) may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule.  The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection (b) may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule if the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-405 Payment by Beneficiary's Bank to Beneficiary. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If the beneficiary's bank credits an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, payment of the bank's obligation under Section 4A-404(a) occurs when and to the extent (i) the beneficiary is notified of the right to withdraw the credit, (ii) the bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary, or (iii) funds with respect to the order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the beneficiary's bank does not credit an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the bank's obligation under Section 4A-404(a) occurs is governed by principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except as stated in subsections (d) and (e), if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a condition to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A funds-transfer system rule may provide that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfers made through the system are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the payment order it accepted.  A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (i) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, (ii) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted.  If the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under Section 4A-406.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) This subsection applies to a funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that (i) nets obligations multilaterally among participants, and (ii) has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations.  If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, (i) the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, (ii) the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, (iii) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under Section 4A-406, and (iv) subject to Section 4A-402(e), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under Section 4A-402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed.

(a) Subject to Sections 4A-211(e), 4A-405(d), and 4A-405(e), the originator of a funds transfer pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order (i) at the time a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary is accepted by the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer and (ii) in an amount equal to the amount of the order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, but not more than the amount of the originator's order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If payment under subsection (a) is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless (i) the payment under subsection (a) was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, (ii) the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary's bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary's refusal of the payment, (iii) funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary, and (iv) the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract.  If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary's bank under Section 4A-404(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under subsection (b), if the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator's payment order less charges of one or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator's order unless upon demand by the beneficiary the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Rights of the originator or of the beneficiary of a funds transfer under this section may be varied only by agreement of the originator and the beneficiary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-501 Variation by Agreement and Effect of Funds-Transfer System Rule. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the rights and obligations of a party to a funds transfer may be varied by agreement of the affected party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Funds-transfer system rule'' means a rule of an association of banks (i) governing transmission of payment orders by means of a funds-transfer system of the association or rights and obligations with respect to those orders, or (ii) to the extent the rule governs rights and obligations between banks that are parties to a funds transfer in which a Federal Reserve Bank, acting as an intermediary bank, sends a payment order to the beneficiary's bank.  Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a funds-transfer system rule governing rights and obligations between participating banks using the system may be effective even if the rule conflicts with this Article and indirectly affects another party to the funds transfer who does not consent to the rule.  A funds-transfer system rule may also govern rights and obligations of parties other than participating banks using the system to the extent stated in Sections 4A-404(c), 4A-405(d), and 4A-507(c).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-502 Creditor Process Served on Receiving Bank;  Setoff by Beneficiary's Bank. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) As used in this section, "creditor process'' means levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration, or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This subsection applies to creditor process with respect to an authorized account of the sender of a payment order if the creditor process is served on the receiving bank.  For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts the payment order the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a beneficiary's bank has received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account.  The amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank or may be applied to satisfy creditor process served on the bank with respect to the account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account and allow withdrawal of the amount credited unless creditor process with respect to the account is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act to prevent withdrawal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owed by that bank to the beneficiary.  Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-506 Rate of Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If, under this Article, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined (i) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank, or (ii) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (a), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable Federal Funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable.  The applicable Federal Funds rate is the average of the Federal Funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360.  The Federal Funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate.  If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4A-507 Choice of Law. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or subsection (c) applies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the parties described in each paragraph of subsection (a) have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern (i) rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system, or (ii) the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system.  A choice of law made pursuant to clause (i) is binding on participating banks.  A choice of law made pursuant to clause (ii) is binding on the originator, other sender, or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender, or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order.  The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system.  The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under subsection (b) and a choice-of-law rule under subsection (c), the agreement under subsection (b) prevails.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If a funds transfer is made by use of more than one funds-transfer system and there is inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of the systems, the matter in issue is governed by the law of the selected jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the matter in issue.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) With the exception of this subsection, subsections (a) and (d), Sections 5-102(a)(9) and (10), 5-106(d), and 5-114(d), and except to the extent prohibited in Sections 1-302 and 5-117(d), the effect of this article may be varied by agreement or by a provision stated or incorporated by reference in an undertaking.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5-109, an issuer shall honor a presentation that, as determined by the standard practice referred to in subsection (e), appears on its face strictly to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 5-113 and unless otherwise agreed with the applicant, an issuer shall dishonor a presentation that does not appear so to comply.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Failure to give the notice specified in subsection (b) or to mention fraud, forgery, or expiration in the notice does not preclude the issuer from asserting as a basis for dishonor fraud or forgery as described in Section 5-109(a) or expiration of the letter of credit before presentation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An issuer shall observe standard practice of financial institutions that regularly issue letters of credit.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the performance or nonperformance of the underlying contract, arrangement, or transaction,

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) an act or omission of others, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) observance or knowledge of the usage of a particular trade other than the standard practice referred to in subsection (e).

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) except as otherwise provided in Sections 5-110 and 5-117, is precluded from restitution of money paid or other value given by mistake to the extent the mistake concerns discrepancies in the documents or tender which are apparent on the face of the presentation;  and

(1) the issuer shall honor the presentation, if honor is demanded by (i) a nominated person who has given value in good faith and without notice of forgery or material fraud, (ii) a confirmer who has honored its confirmation in good faith, (iii) a holder in due course of a draft drawn under the letter of credit which was taken after acceptance by the issuer or nominated person, or (iv) an assignee of the issuer's or nominated person's deferred obligation that was taken for value and without notice of forgery or material fraud after the obligation was incurred by the issuer or nominated person;  and

(2) the issuer, acting in good faith, may honor or dishonor the presentation in any other case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If an applicant claims that a required document is forged or materially fraudulent or that honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant, a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation or grant similar relief against the issuer or other persons only if the court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the relief is not prohibited under the law applicable to an accepted draft or deferred obligation incurred by the issuer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a beneficiary, issuer, or nominated person who may be adversely affected is adequately protected against loss that it may suffer because the relief is granted;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) all of the conditions to entitle a person to the relief under the law of this state have been met;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) on the basis of the information submitted to the court, the applicant is more likely than not to succeed under its claim of forgery or material fraud and the person demanding honor does not qualify for protection under subsection (a)(1).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:5-111 Remedies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors or repudiates its obligation to pay money under a letter of credit before presentation, the beneficiary, successor, or nominated person presenting on its own behalf may recover from the issuer the amount that is the subject of the dishonor or repudiation.  If the issuer's obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant's election, recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer.  In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages.  The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection.  If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant's recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided.  The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided.  In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit or honors a draft or demand in breach of its obligation to the applicant, the applicant may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If an adviser or nominated person other than a confirmer breaches an obligation under this article or an issuer breaches an obligation not covered in subsection (a) or (b), a person to whom the obligation is owed may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach.  To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the liability of an issuer specified in this subsection and subsections (a) and (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An issuer, nominated person, or adviser who is found liable under subsection (a), (b), or (c) shall pay interest on the amount owed thereunder from the date of wrongful dishonor or other appropriate date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation must be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Damages that would otherwise be payable by a party for breach of an obligation under this article may be liquidated by agreement or undertaking, but only in an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the harm anticipated.

(a) A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents, and receive payment or other items of value in the name of the beneficiary without disclosing its status as a successor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents, and receive payment or other items of value in its own name as the disclosed successor of the beneficiary.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), an issuer shall recognize a disclosed successor of a beneficiary as beneficiary in full substitution for its predecessor upon compliance with the requirements for recognition by the issuer of a transfer of drawing rights by operation of law under the standard practice referred to in Section 5-108(e) or, in the absence of such a practice, compliance with other reasonable procedures sufficient to protect the issuer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An issuer is not obliged to determine whether a purported successor is a successor of a beneficiary or whether the signature of a purported successor is genuine or authorized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Honor of a purported successor's apparently complying presentation under subsection (a) or (b) has the consequences specified in Section 5-108(i) even if the purported successor is not the successor of a beneficiary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:5-114 Assignment of Proceeds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In this section, "proceeds of a letter of credit'' means the cash, check, accepted draft, or other item of value paid or delivered upon honor or giving of value by the issuer or any nominated person under the letter of credit.  The term does not include a beneficiary's drawing rights or documents presented by the beneficiary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A beneficiary may assign its right to part or all of the proceeds of a letter of credit.  The beneficiary may do so before presentation as a present assignment of its right to receive proceeds contingent upon its compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An issuer or nominated person need not recognize an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit until it consents to the assignment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An issuer or nominated person has no obligation to give or withhold its consent to an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit, but consent may not be unreasonably withheld if the assignee possesses and exhibits the letter of credit and presentation of the letter of credit is a condition to honor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person are independent of the beneficiary's assignment of the proceeds of a letter of credit and are superior to the assignee's right to the proceeds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Neither the rights recognized by this section between an assignee and an issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person nor the issuer's or nominated person's payment of proceeds to an assignee or a third person affect the rights between the assignee and any person other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person.  The mode of creating and perfecting a security interest in or granting an assignment of a beneficiary's rights to proceeds is governed by Article 9 or other law.  Against persons other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person, the rights and obligations arising upon the creation of a security interest or other assignment of a beneficiary's right to proceeds and its perfection are governed by Article 9 or other law.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:5-116 Choice of Law and Forum. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in the form of a record signed or otherwise authenticated by the affected parties in the manner provided in Section 5-104 or by a provision in the person's letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking.  The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless subsection (a) applies, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located.  The person is considered to be located at the address indicated in the person's undertaking.  If more than one address is indicated, the person is considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued.  For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under this subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made subject.  If (i) this article would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under subsection (a) or (b), (ii) the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice, and (iii) there is conflict between this article and those rules as applied to that undertaking, those rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvariable provisions specified in Section 5-103(c).

<codesect>
(a) An issuer that honors a beneficiary's presentation is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to the same extent as if the issuer were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary and of the applicant to the same extent as if the issuer were the secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An applicant that reimburses an issuer is subrogated to the rights of the issuer against any beneficiary, presenter, or nominated person to the same extent as if the applicant were the secondary obligor of the obligations owed to the issuer and has the rights of subrogation of the issuer to the rights of the beneficiary stated in subsection (a).
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the issuer against the applicant to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the obligation owed to the issuer by the applicant;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) So long as and to the extent that an issuer or nominated person has not been reimbursed or has not otherwise recovered the value given with respect to a security interest in a document under subsection (a), the security interest continues and is subject to Article 9, but:

(b) Unless a warehouse receipt provides for each of the following, the warehouse is liable for damages caused to a person injured by its omission:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a statement of the location of the warehouse facility where the goods are stored;

(6) a description of the goods or the packages containing them;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) the signature of the warehouse or its agent;

<codesect>
(a) A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its failure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances.  Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not liable.  Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse's liability for conversion to its own use.  On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse's liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse receipt.  In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-206 Termination of Storage at Warehouse's Option. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are held and any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of any charges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage fixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not less than 30 days after the warehouse gives notice.  If the goods are not removed before the date specified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to Section 7-210.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in subsection (a) and Section 7-210, the warehouse may specify in the notice given under subsection (a) any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not have notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse facilities, or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this article upon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.

(b) If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in common by the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for that owner's share.

<center><h3>Section 382-A:7-209</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-209 Lien of Warehouse. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse.  However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (a), such as for money advanced and interest.  The security interest is governed by Article 9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) or a security interest under subsection (b) is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good-faith purchaser for value would have been valid.  However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) power to obtain delivery under Section 7-403;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) power of disposition under Sections 2-403, 2A-304(2), 2A-305(2), 9-320, or 9-321(c) or other statute or rule of law;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under subsection (a) is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit.  In this subsection, "household goods'' means furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.

<center><h3>Section 382-A:7-210</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-210 Enforcement of Warehouse's Lien. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a warehouse's lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods shall be notified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The notification shall include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than 10 days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The sale shall conform to the terms of the notification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The sale shall be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or stored.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale shall be published once a week for 2 weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held.  The advertisement shall include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time and place of the sale.  The sale shall take place at least 15 days after the first publication.  If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement shall be posted at least 10 days before the sale in not fewer than 6 conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but shall be retained by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse's noncompliance with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may be enforced in accordance with subsection (a) or (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-301 Liability for Nonreceipt or Misdescription;  "Said to Contain'';  "Shipper's Weight, Load, and Count'';  Improper Handling. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith, or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description of the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages unknown,'' "said to contain,'' "shipper's weight, load, and count,'' or words of similar import, if that indication is true.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the kind and quantity if shipped in bulk;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) words such as "shipper's weight, load, and count,'' or words of similar import indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods concealed in packages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so.  In that case, "shipper's weight'' or words of similar import are ineffective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight, load, and count,'' or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper loading.  However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages caused by improper loading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in those particulars.  This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer's responsibility or liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

(a) The issuer of a through bill of lading, or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, is liable to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the other person or the performing carrier of its obligation under the bill or other document.  However, to the extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in territory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including matters other than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carrier may be varied by agreement of the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by that person, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in its possession, to the obligation of the issuer.  The person's obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liability for breach by any other person or by the issuer.

(c) The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in subsection (a) is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in possession of the goods when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a tangible bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts, each of which contains an identification code and is expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been delivered against any other part, the whole of the parts constitutes one bill.

(a) A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier's receipt of the goods for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges are stated, a reasonable charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) on goods that the carrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject the goods to those charges and expenses.  Any other lien under subsection (a) is effective against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.

<center><h3>Section 382-A:7-308</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-308 Enforcement of Carrier's Lien. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier's noncompliance with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier would have been bound to deliver the goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either subsection (a) or the procedure set forth in Section 7-210(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-309 Duty of Care;  Contractual Limitation of Carrier's Liability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances.  This subsection does not affect any statute, regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused by its negligence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation agreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation agreement if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity.  However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a transportation agreement.

<center><h3>Section 382-A:7-501</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-501 Form of Negotiation and Requirements of Due Negotiation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person, the document is negotiated by the named person's indorsement and delivery.  After the named person's indorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the document's original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and it is delivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requires indorsement by the named person and delivery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, the document is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person.  Indorsement by the named person is not required to negotiate the document.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and the named person has control of the document, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves taking delivery of the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Indorsement of a nonnegotiable document of title neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The naming in a negotiable bill of lading of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of the bill of any interest of that person in the goods.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-502 Rights Acquired by Due Negotiation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Subject to Sections 7-205 and 7-503, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) title to the document;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) title to the goods;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) all rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods according to the terms of the document free of any defense or claim by the issuer except those arising under the terms of the document or under this article, but in the case of a delivery order, the bailee's obligation accrues only upon the bailee's acceptance of the delivery order and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser will procure the acceptance of the bailee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subject to Section 7-503, title and rights acquired by due negotiation are not defeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the document of title or by surrender of the goods by the bailee and are not impaired even if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of duty;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document or control of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) a previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a third person.

(a) A document of title confers no right in goods against a person that before issuance of the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) power to obtain delivery under Section 7-403;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) power of disposition under Section 2-403, 2A-304(2), 2A-305(2), 9-320, or 9-321(c) or other statute or rule of law;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of any person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated.  That title may be defeated under Section 7-504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of any person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated.  However, delivery by the carrier in accordance with Part 4 pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver.

<codesect>
(a) A transferee of a document of title, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, to which the document has been delivered but not duly negotiated, acquires the title and rights that its transferor had or had actual authority to convey.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of a transfer of a nonnegotiable document of title, until but not after the bailee receives notice of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) by those creditors of the transferor which could treat the transfer as void under Section 2-402 or 2A-308;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) by a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of the buyer's rights;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) by a lessee from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the lessee or received notification of the lessee's rights;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) as against the bailee, by good-faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in a nonnegotiable bill of lading which causes the bailee not to deliver the goods to the consignee defeats the consignee's title to the goods if the goods have been delivered to a buyer in ordinary course of business or a lessee in ordinary course of business and, in any event, defeats the consignee's rights against the bailee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Delivery of the goods pursuant to a nonnegotiable document of title may be stopped by a seller under Section 2-705 or a lessor under Section 2A-526, subject to the requirements of due notification in those sections.  A bailee that honors the seller's or lessor's instructions is entitled to be indemnified by the seller or lessor against any resulting loss or expense.

<codesect>
(a) If a document of title is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court may order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may without liability to any person comply with the order.  If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimant's posting security unless it finds that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control of the document is adequately protected against the loss.

(b) A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming under a missing negotiable document of title is liable to any person injured thereby.  If the delivery is not in good faith, the bailee is liable for conversion.

<center><h3>Section 382-A:8-103</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:8-103 Rules for Determining Whether Certain Obligations and Interests are Securities or Financial Assets. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock company, or similar entity is a security.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An "investment company security'' is a security.  "Investment company security'' means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered.  Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this Article, or it is an investment company security.  However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this Article and not by Article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that Article.  However, a negotiable instrument governed by Article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A commodity contract, as defined in Section 9-102(a)(15), is not a security or a financial asset.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A document of title is not a financial asset unless Section 8-102(a)(9)(iii) applies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:8-104 Acquisition of Security or Financial Asset or Interest Therein. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A person acquires a security or an interest therein, under this Article, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the person is a purchaser to whom a security is delivered pursuant to Section 8-301;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the person acquires a security entitlement to the security pursuant to Section 8-501.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person acquires a financial asset, other than a security, or an interest therein, under this Article, if the person acquires a security entitlement to the financial asset.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person who acquires a security entitlement to a security or other financial asset has the rights specified in Part 5, but is a purchaser of any security, security entitlement, or other financial asset held by the securities intermediary only to the extent provided in Section 8-503.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Unless the context shows that a different meaning is intended, a person who is required by other law, regulation, rule, or agreement to transfer, deliver, present, surrender, exchange, or otherwise put in the possession of another person a security or financial asset satisfies that requirement by causing the other person to acquire an interest in the security or financial asset pursuant to subsection (a) or (b).

(1) the person knows of the adverse claim;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the person is aware of facts sufficient to indicate that there is a significant probability that the adverse claim exists and deliberately avoids information that would establish the existence of the adverse claim;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the person has a duty, imposed by statute or regulation, to investigate whether an adverse claim exists, and the investigation so required would establish the existence of the adverse claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Having knowledge that a financial asset or interest therein is or has been transferred by a representative imposes no duty of inquiry into the rightfulness of a transaction and is not notice of an adverse claim.  However, a person who knows that a representative has transferred a financial asset or interest therein in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a security certificate or sets a date on or after which the certificate is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not itself constitute notice of an adverse claim except in the case of a transfer more than:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) one year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) six months after a date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the certificate, if money was available for payment on that date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A purchaser of a certificated security has notice of an adverse claim if the security certificate:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) whether in bearer or registered form, has been indorsed "for collection'' or "for surrender'' or for some other purpose not involving transfer;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) is in bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, but the mere writing of a name on the certificate is not such a statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Filing of a financing statement under Article 9 is not notice of an adverse claim to a financial asset.

(2) the issuer has agreed that it will comply with instructions originated by the purchaser without further consent by the registered owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A purchaser has "control'' of a security entitlement if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the purchaser becomes the entitlement holder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the securities intermediary has agreed that it will comply with entitlement orders originated by the purchaser without further consent by the entitlement holder;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) another person has control of the security entitlement on behalf of the purchaser or, having previously acquired control of the security entitlement, acknowledges that it has control on behalf of the purchaser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If an interest in a security entitlement is granted by the entitlement holder to the entitlement holder's own securities intermediary, the securities intermediary has control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A purchaser who has satisfied the requirements of subsection (c) or (d) has control even if the registered owner in the case of subsection (c) or the entitlement holder in the case of subsection (d) retains the right to make substitutions for the uncertificated security or security entitlement, to originate instructions or entitlement orders to the issuer or securities intermediary, or otherwise to deal with the uncertificated security or security entitlement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) An issuer or a securities intermediary may not enter into an agreement of the kind described in subsection (c)(2) or (d)(2) without the consent of the registered owner or entitlement holder, but an issuer or a securities intermediary is not required to enter into such an agreement even though the registered owner or entitlement holder so directs.  An issuer or securities intermediary that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another party unless requested to do so by the registered owner or entitlement holder.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:8-110 Applicability;  Choice of Law. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The local law of the issuer's jurisdiction, as specified in subsection (d), governs:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the validity of a security;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the rights and duties of the issuer with respect to registration of transfer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the effectiveness of registration of transfer by the issuer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) whether the issuer owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a security;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person to whom transfer of a certificated or uncertificated security is registered or a person who obtains control of an uncertificated security.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The local law of the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, as specified in subsection (e), governs:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) acquisition of a security entitlement from the securities intermediary;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the rights and duties of the securities intermediary and entitlement holder arising out of a security entitlement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) whether the securities intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a security entitlement;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person who acquires a security entitlement from the securities intermediary or a person who purchases a security entitlement or interest therein from an entitlement holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The local law of the jurisdiction in which a security certificate is located at the time of delivery governs whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person to whom the security certificate is delivered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Issuer's jurisdiction'' means the jurisdiction under which the issuer of the security is organized or, if permitted by the law of that jurisdiction, the law of another jurisdiction specified by the issuer.  An issuer organized under the law of this state may specify the law of another jurisdiction as the law governing the matters specified in subsection (a)(2) through (5).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The following rules determine a "securities intermediary's jurisdiction'' for purposes of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction for purposes of this part, this article, or this chapter, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If paragraph (1) does not apply and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that the agreement is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If neither paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If none of the preceding paragraphs applies, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the entitlement holder's account is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) If none of the preceding paragraphs applies, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the chief executive office of the securities intermediary is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A securities intermediary's jurisdiction is not determined by the physical location of certificates representing financial assets, or by the jurisdiction in which is organized the issuer of the financial asset with respect to which an entitlement holder has a security entitlement, or by the location of facilities for data processing or other record keeping concerning the account.

(1) places or authorizes the placing of its name on a security certificate, other than as authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or the like, to evidence a share, participation, or other interest in its property or in an enterprise, or to evidence its duty to perform an obligation represented by the certificate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) creates a share, participation, or other interest in its property or in an enterprise, or undertakes an obligation, that is an uncertificated security;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:8-202 Issuer's Responsibility and Defenses;  Notice of Defect or Defense. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a certificated security include terms stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by reference on the certificate to another instrument, indenture, or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, to the extent the terms referred to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate.  A reference under this subsection does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the security, even if the certificate expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice.  The terms of an uncertificated security include those stated in any instrument, indenture, or document or in a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The following rules apply if an issuer asserts that a security is not valid:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A security other than one issued by a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, even though issued with a defect going to its validity, is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the particular defect unless the defect involves a violation of a constitutional provision.  In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than one who takes by original issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Paragraph (1) applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8-205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) All other defenses of the issuer of a security, including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a certificated security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken the certificated security without notice of the particular defense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) This section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security "when, as and if issued'' or "when distributed'' in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the subject of the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or distributed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If a security is held by a securities intermediary against whom an entitlement holder has a security entitlement with respect to the security, the issuer may not assert any defense that the issuer could not assert if the entitlement holder held the security directly.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) requires the payment of money, the delivery of a certificated security, the registration of transfer of an uncertificated security, or any of them on presentation or surrender of the security certificate, the money or security is available on the date set for payment or exchange, and the purchaser takes the security more than one year after that date;  or

(a) An indorsement may be in blank or special.  An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer.  A special indorsement specifies to whom a security is to be transferred or who has power to transfer it.  A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An indorsement, whether special or in blank, does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the certificate on which it appears or, if the indorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the document and the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied.  However, against a transferor, a transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement supplied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An indorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim to the certificate, but it does not otherwise affect a right to registration that the holder possesses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Unless otherwise agreed, a person making an indorsement assumes only the obligations provided in Section 8-108 and not an obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the signature was genuine;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the signer was an appropriate person to indorse, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the signer had legal capacity to sign.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person who guarantees a signature of the originator of an instruction warrants that at the time of signing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the signature was genuine;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the signer was an appropriate person to originate the instruction, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person, if the person specified in the instruction as the registered owner was, in fact, the registered owner, as to which fact the signature guarantor does not make a warranty;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the signer had legal capacity to sign.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person who specially guarantees the signature of an originator of an instruction makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection (b) and also warrants that at the time the instruction is presented to the issuer:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the person specified in the instruction as the registered owner of the uncertificated security will be the registered owner;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the transfer of the uncertificated security requested in the instruction will be registered by the issuer free from all liens, security interests, restrictions, and claims other than those specified in the instruction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A guarantor under subsections (a) and (b) or a special guarantor under subsection (c) does not otherwise warrant the rightfulness of the transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A person who guarantees an indorsement of a security certificate makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection (a) and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A person who guarantees an instruction requesting the transfer of an uncertificated security makes the warranties of a special signature guarantor under subsection (c) and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) An issuer may not require a special guaranty of signature, a guaranty of indorsement, or a guaranty of instruction as a condition to registration of transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The warranties under this section are made to a person taking or dealing with the security in reliance on the guaranty, and the guarantor is liable to the person for loss resulting from their breach.  An indorser or originator of an instruction whose signature, indorsement, or instruction has been guaranteed is liable to a guarantor for any loss suffered by the guarantor as a result of breach of the warranties of the guarantor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:8-403 Demand That Issuer Not Register Transfer. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A person who is an appropriate person to make an indorsement or originate an instruction may demand that the issuer not register transfer of a security by communicating to the issuer a notification that identifies the registered owner and the issue of which the security is a part and provides an address for communications directed to the person making the demand.  The demand is effective only if it is received by the issuer at a time and in a manner affording the issuer reasonable opportunity to act on it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a certificated security in registered form is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer or an instruction is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer of an uncertificated security after a demand that the issuer not register transfer has become effective, the issuer shall promptly communicate to (i) the person who initiated the demand at the address provided in the demand and (ii) the person who presented the security for registration of transfer or initiated the instruction requesting registration of transfer a notification stating that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the certificated security has been presented for registration of transfer or the instruction for registration of transfer of the uncertificated security has been received;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a demand that the issuer not register transfer had previously been received;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the issuer will withhold registration of transfer for a period of time stated in the notification in order to provide the person who initiated the demand an opportunity to obtain legal process or an indemnity bond.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The period described in subsection (b)(3) may not exceed 30 days after the date of communication of the notification.  A shorter period may be specified by the issuer if it is not manifestly unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An issuer is not liable to a person who initiated a demand that the issuer not register transfer for any loss the person suffers as a result of registration of a transfer pursuant to an effective indorsement or instruction if the person who initiated the demand does not, within the time stated in the issuer's communication, either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction, or other process from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from registering the transfer;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) file with the issuer an indemnity bond, sufficient in the issuer's judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar, or other agent of the issuer involved from any loss it or they may suffer by refusing to register the transfer.

(3) after the issuer had been served with an injunction, restraining order, or other legal process enjoining it from registering the transfer, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the issuer had a reasonable opportunity to act on the injunction, restraining order, or other legal process;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) by an issuer acting in collusion with the wrongdoer.

<codesect>
(a) To the extent necessary for a securities intermediary to satisfy all security entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset, all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary are held by the securities intermediary for the entitlement holders, are not property of the securities intermediary, and are not subject to claims of creditors of the securities intermediary, except as otherwise provided in Section 8-511.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (a) is a pro rata property interest in all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary, without regard to the time the entitlement holder acquired the security entitlement or the time the securities intermediary acquired the interest in that financial asset.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (a) may be enforced against the securities intermediary only by exercise of the entitlement holder's rights under Sections 8-505 through 8-508.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (a) may be enforced against a purchaser of the financial asset or interest therein only if:

(3) the securities intermediary violated its obligations under Section 8-504 by transferring the financial asset or interest therein to the purchaser;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the purchaser is not protected under subsection (e).  The trustee or other liquidator, acting on behalf of all entitlement holders having security entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset, may recover the financial asset, or interest therein, from the purchaser.  If the trustee or other liquidator elects not to pursue that right, an entitlement holder whose security entitlement remains unsatisfied has the right to recover its interest in the financial asset from the purchaser.

(e) An action based on the entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (a), whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory, may not be asserted against any purchaser of a financial asset or interest therein who gives value, obtains control, and does not act in collusion with the securities intermediary in violating the securities intermediary's obligations under Section 8-504.

(g) Burden of proof in non-consumer-goods transaction.  In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a secured party claiming a purchase-money security interest has the burden of establishing the extent to which the security interest is a purchase-money security interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Non-consumer-goods transactions;  no inference.  The limitation of the rules in subsections (e), (f), and (g) to transactions other than consumer-goods transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer-goods transactions.  The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer-goods transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-108 Sufficiency of Description. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Sufficiency of description.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e), a description of personal or real property is sufficient, whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Examples of reasonable identification.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), a description of collateral reasonably identifies the collateral if it identifies the collateral by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) specific listing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) category;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a type of collateral defined in this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) quantity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) computational or allocational formula or procedure;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any other method, if the identity of the collateral is objectively determinable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Supergeneric description not sufficient.  A description of collateral as "all the debtor's assets'' or "all the debtor's personal property'' or using words of similar import does not reasonably identify the collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Investment property.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a description of a security entitlement, securities account, or commodity account is sufficient if it describes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the collateral by those terms or as investment property;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the underlying financial asset or commodity contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When description by type insufficient.  A description only by type of collateral defined in this chapter is an insufficient description of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a commercial tort claim;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-203 Attachment and Enforceability of Security Interest;  Proceeds;  Supporting Obligations;  Formal Requisites. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Attachment.  A security interest attaches to collateral when it becomes enforceable against the debtor with respect to the collateral, unless an agreement expressly postpones the time of attachment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enforceability.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) through (i), a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to the collateral only if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) value has been given;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) one of the following conditions is met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the debtor has authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral and, if the security interest covers timber to be cut, a description of the land concerned;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) the collateral is not a certificated security and is in the possession of the secured party under Section 9-313 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) the collateral is a certificated security in registered form and the security certificate has been delivered to the secured party under Section 8-301 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) the collateral is deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic documents, and the secured party has control under Section 7-106, 9-104, 9-105, 9-106, or 9-107 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Other UCC provisions.  Subsection (b) is subject to Section 4-210 on the security interest of a collecting bank, Section 5-118 on the security interest of a letter-of-credit issuer or nominated person, Section 9-110 on a security interest arising under Article 2 or 2A, and Section 9-206 on security interests in investment property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When person becomes bound by another person's security agreement.  A person becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person if, by operation of law other than this article or by contract:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the security agreement becomes effective to create a security interest in the person's property;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the person becomes generally obligated for the obligations of the other person, including the obligation secured under the security agreement, and acquires or succeeds to all or substantially all of the assets of the other person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Effect of new debtor becoming bound.  If a new debtor becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the agreement satisfies subsection (b)(3) with respect to existing or after-acquired property of the new debtor to the extent the property is described in the agreement;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) another agreement is not necessary to make a security interest in the property enforceable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Proceeds and supporting obligations.  The attachment of a security interest in collateral gives the secured party the rights to proceeds provided by Section 9-315 and is also attachment of a security interest in a supporting obligation for the collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Lien securing right to payment.  The attachment of a security interest in a right to payment or performance secured by a security interest or other lien on personal or real property is also attachment of a security interest in the security interest, mortgage, or other lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Security entitlement carried in securities account.  The attachment of a security interest in a securities account is also attachment of a security interest in the security entitlements carried in the securities account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Commodity contracts carried in commodity account.  The attachment of a security interest in a commodity account is also attachment of a security interest in the commodity contracts carried in the commodity account.

(1) consumer goods, other than an accession when given as additional security, unless the debtor acquires rights in them within 10 days after the secured party gives value;  or

(1) the debtor has the right or ability to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) use, commingle, or dispose of all or part of the collateral, including returned or repossessed goods;

(a) Perfection by possession or delivery.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a secured party may perfect a security interest in tangible negotiable documents, goods, instruments, money, or tangible chattel paper by taking possession of the collateral.  A secured party may perfect a security interest in certificated securities by taking delivery of the certificated securities under Section 8-301.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Goods covered by certificate of title.  With respect to goods covered by a certificate of title issued by this State, a secured party may perfect a security interest in the goods by taking possession of the goods only in the circumstances described in Section 9-316(d).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Collateral in possession of person other than debtor.  With respect to collateral other than certificated securities and goods covered by a document, a secured party takes possession of collateral in the possession of a person other than the debtor, the secured party, or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor's business, when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the person in possession authenticates a record acknowledging that it holds possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the person takes possession of the collateral after having authenticated a record acknowledging that it will hold possession of collateral for the secured party's benefit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Time of perfection by possession;  continuation of perfection.  If perfection of a security interest depends upon possession of the collateral by a secured party, perfection occurs no earlier than the time the secured party takes possession and continues only while the secured party retains possession.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Time of perfection by delivery;  continuation of perfection.  A security interest in a certificated security in registered form is perfected by delivery when delivery of the certificated security occurs under Section 8-301 and remains perfected by delivery until the debtor obtains possession of the security certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Acknowledgment not required.  A person in possession of collateral is not required to acknowledge that it holds possession for a secured party's benefit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Effectiveness of acknowledgment;  no duties or confirmation.  If a person acknowledges that it holds possession for the secured party's benefit:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the acknowledgment is effective under subsection (c) or Section 8-301(a), even if the acknowledgment violates the rights of a debtor;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) unless the person otherwise agrees or law other than this article otherwise provides, the person does not owe any duty to the secured party and is not required to confirm the acknowledgment to another person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Secured party's delivery to person other than debtor.  A secured party having possession of collateral does not relinquish possession by delivering the collateral to a person other than the debtor or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor's business if the person was instructed before the delivery or is instructed contemporaneously with the delivery:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) to hold possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) to redeliver the collateral to the secured party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Effect of delivery under subsection (h);  no duties or confirmation.  A secured party does not relinquish possession, even if a delivery under subsection (h) violates the rights of a debtor.  A person to which collateral is delivered under subsection (h) does not owe any duty to the secured party and is not required to confirm the delivery to another person unless the person otherwise agrees or law other than this article otherwise provides.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(2) a security interest attaches to any identifiable proceeds of collateral.
<br>

<center><h3>Section 382-A:9-316</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-316 Effect of Change in Governing Law. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) General rule:  effect on perfection of change in governing law.  A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) remains perfected until the earliest of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the expiration of 4 months after a change of the debtor's location to another jurisdiction;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the expiration of one year after a transfer of collateral to a person that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Security interest perfected or unperfected under law of new jurisdiction.  If a security interest described in subsection (a) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Possessory security interest in collateral moved to new jurisdiction.  A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods, remains continuously perfected if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Goods covered by certificate of title from this state.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a security interest in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate of title from this State remains perfected until the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become so covered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When subsection (d) security interest becomes unperfected against purchasers.  A security interest described in subsection (d) becomes unperfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable requirements for perfection under Section 9-311(b) or 9-313 are not satisfied before the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate of title from this State;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the expiration of 4 months after the goods had become so covered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Change in jurisdiction of bank, issuer, nominated person, securities intermediary, or commodity intermediary.  A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's jurisdiction, the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, or the commodity intermediary's jurisdiction, as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of that jurisdiction;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the expiration of 4 months after a change of the applicable jurisdiction to another jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Subsection (f) security interest perfected or unperfected under law of new jurisdiction.  If a security interest described in subsection (f) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or the end of the period described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Effect on filed financing statement of change in governing law.   The following rules apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within 4 months after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction: 
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A financing statement filed before the change pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) is effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the debtor not changed its location.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If a security interest perfected by a financing statement that is effective under paragraph (1) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) or the expiration of the 4-month period, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Effect of change in governing law on financing statement filed against original debtor.  If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within 4 months after, the new debtor becomes bound under Section 9-203(d), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the collateral been acquired by the original debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A security interest perfected by the financing statement and which becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) or the expiration of the 4-month period remains perfected thereafter.  A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement but which does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Lessees that receive delivery.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-322 Priorities Among Conflicting Security Interests in and Agricultural Liens on Same Collateral. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) General priority rules.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral is determined according to the following rules:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection.  Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Time of perfection:  proceeds and supporting obligations.  For the purposes of subsection (a)(1):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Special priority rules:  proceeds and supporting obligations.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under Section 9-327, 9-328, 9-329, 9-330, or 9-331 also has priority over a conflicting security interest in:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) any supporting obligation for the collateral;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) proceeds of the collateral if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the security interest in proceeds is perfected;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) the proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) in the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) First-to-file priority rule for certain collateral.  Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Applicability of subsection (d).  Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Limitations on subsections (a) through (e).  Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Section 4-210 with respect to a security interest of a collecting bank;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Section 5-118 with respect to a security interest of an issuer or nominated person;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Section 9-110 with respect to a security interest arising under Article 2 or 2A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Priority under agricultural lien statute.  A perfected agricultural lien on collateral has priority over a conflicting security interest in or agricultural lien on the same collateral if the statute creating the agricultural lien so provides.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) When priority based on time of advance.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), for purposes of determining the priority of a perfected security interest under Section 9-322(a)(1), perfection of the security interest dates from the time an advance is made to the extent that the security interest secures an advance that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) is made while the security interest is perfected only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Lien creditor.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a security interest is subordinate to the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor to the extent that the security interest secures an advance made more than 45 days after the person becomes a lien creditor unless the advance is made:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) without knowledge of the lien;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lien.

(c) Buyer of receivables.  Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to a security interest held by a secured party that is a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes or a consignor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Buyer of goods.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer of goods other than a buyer in ordinary course of business takes free of a security interest to the extent that it secures advances made after the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the time the secured party acquires knowledge of the buyer's purchase;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) 45 days after the purchase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Advances made pursuant to commitment:  priority of buyer of goods.  Subsection (d) does not apply if the advance is made pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the buyer's purchase and before the expiration of the 45-day period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same goods, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a perfected security interest in its identifiable proceeds also has priority, if the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.
<br>

(b) Inventory purchase-money priority.  Subject to subsection (c) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in inventory has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same inventory, has priority over a conflicting security interest in chattel paper or an instrument constituting proceeds of the inventory and in proceeds of the chattel paper, if so provided in Section 9-330, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, also has priority in identifiable cash proceeds of the inventory to the extent the identifiable cash proceeds are received on or before the delivery of the inventory to a buyer, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the inventory;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) if the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Livestock purchase-money priority.  Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in livestock that are farm products has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same livestock, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a perfected security interest in their identifiable proceeds and identifiable products in their unmanufactured states also has priority, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the livestock;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(1) a security interest securing an obligation incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral has priority over a security interest securing an obligation incurred for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of collateral;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in all other cases, Section 9-322(a) applies to the qualifying security interests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-325 Priority of Security Interests in Transferred Collateral. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Subordination of security interest in transferred collateral.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a security interest created by a debtor is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral created by another person if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor acquired the collateral subject to the security interest created by the other person;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the security interest created by the other person was perfected when the debtor acquired the collateral;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) there is no period thereafter when the security interest is unperfected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Limitation of subsection (a) subordination.  Subsection (a) subordinates a security interest only if the security interest:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) otherwise would have priority solely under Section 9-322(a) or 9-324;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) arose solely under Section 2-711(3) or 2A-508(5).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-326 Priority of Security Interests Created by New Debtor. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Subordination of security interest created by new debtor.  Subject to subsection (b), a security interest that is created by a new debtor in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights and is perfected solely by a filed financing statement that would be ineffective to perfect the security interest but for the application of Section 9-316(i)(1) or 9-508 is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral which is perfected other than by such a filed financing statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Priority under other provisions;  multiple original debtors.  The other provisions of this part determine the priority among conflicting security interests in the same collateral perfected by filed financing statements described in subsection (a).  However, if the security agreements to which a new debtor became bound as debtor were not entered into by the same original debtor, the conflicting security interests rank according to priority in time of the new debtor's having become bound.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Purchaser's priority:  security interest claimed merely as proceeds.  A purchaser of chattel paper has priority over a security interest in the chattel paper which is claimed merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in good faith and in the ordinary course of the purchaser's business, the purchaser gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper under Section 9-105;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the chattel paper does not indicate that it has been assigned to an identified assignee other than the purchaser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Purchaser's priority:  other security interests. A purchaser of chattel paper has priority over a security interest in the chattel paper which is claimed other than merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest if the purchaser gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper under Section 9-105 in good faith, in the ordinary course of the purchaser's business, and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Chattel paper purchaser's priority in proceeds. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a purchaser having priority in chattel paper under subsection (a) or (b) also has priority in proceeds of the chattel paper to the extent that:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the proceeds consist of the specific goods covered by the chattel paper or cash proceeds of the specific goods, even if the purchaser's security interest in the proceeds is unperfected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Instrument purchaser's priority.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-331(a), a purchaser of an instrument has priority over a security interest in the instrument perfected by a method other than possession if the purchaser gives value and takes possession of the instrument in good faith and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Holder of purchase-money security interest gives new value.  For purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the holder of a purchase-money security interest in inventory gives new value for chattel paper constituting proceeds of the inventory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-334 Priority of Security Interests in Fixtures and Crops. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Security interest in fixtures under this article.  A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures.  A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Security interest in fixtures under real-property law.  This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) General rule:  subordination of security interest in fixtures.  In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Fixtures purchase-money priority.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the security interest is a purchase-money security interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Priority of security interest in fixtures over interests in real property.  A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) factory or office machines;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Priority based on consent, disclaimer, or right to remove.  A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Continuation of paragraph (f)(2) priority.  The priority of the security interest under paragraph (f)(2) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Priority of construction mortgage.  A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction.  A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Priority of security interest in crops.  A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Removal of accession after default.  After default, subject to Part 6, a secured party may remove an accession from other goods if the security interest in the accession has priority over the claims of every person having an interest in the whole.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Reimbursement following removal.  A secured party that removes an accession from other goods under subsection (e) shall promptly reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or of the other goods, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods.  The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it.  A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-336 Commingled Goods. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Commingled goods.''  In this section, "commingled goods'' means goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that their identity is lost in a product or mass.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No security interest in commingled goods as such.  A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such.  However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Attachment of security interest to product or mass.  If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Perfection of security interest.  If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c) is perfected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Priority of security interest.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Conflicting security interests in product or mass.  If more than one security interest attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c), the following rules determine priority:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A security interest that is perfected under subsection (d) has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If more than one security interest is perfected under subsection (d), the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods.

<codesect>
If, while a security interest in goods is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction, this State issues a certificate of title that does not show that the goods are subject to the security interest or contain a statement that they may be subject to security interests not shown on the certificate:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate and without knowledge of the security interest;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under Section 9-311(b), after issuance of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest.

(2) a purchaser, other than a secured party, of the collateral takes free of the security interest or agricultural lien to the extent that, in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments, or a security certificate, receives delivery of the collateral.

(a) "Value.''  In this section, "value'' has the meaning provided in Section 3-303(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Agreement not to assert claim or defense.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by an assignee that takes an assignment:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) for value;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in good faith;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) without notice of a claim of a property or possessory right to the property assigned;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) without notice of a defense or claim in recoupment of the type that may be asserted against a person entitled to enforce a negotiable instrument under Section 3-305(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When subsection (b) not applicable.  Subsection (b) does not apply to defenses of a type that may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under Section 3-305(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Omission of required statement in consumer transaction.  In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than this article requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the rights of an assignee are subject to claims or defenses that the account debtor could assert against the original obligee, and the record does not include such a statement:
<br>

(1) the record has the same effect as if the record included such a statement;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) all terms of the agreement between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the transaction that gave rise to the contract;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives a notification of the assignment authenticated by the assignor or the assignee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Account debtor's claim reduces amount owed to assignee.  Subject to subsection (c) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the claim of an account debtor against an assignor may be asserted against an assignee under subsection (a) only to reduce the amount the account debtor owes.

(d) Omission of required statement in consumer transaction.  In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than this article requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the account debtor's recovery against an assignee with respect to claims and defenses against the assignor may not exceed amounts paid by the account debtor under the record, and the record does not include such a statement, the extent to which a claim of an account debtor against the assignor may be asserted against an assignee is determined as if the record included such a statement.

After receipt of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not discharge the obligation by paying the assignor.

(1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the account debtor or person obligated on the promissory note to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Inapplicability of subsection (d) to certain sales.  Subsection (d) does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under Section 9-610 or an acceptance of collateral under Section 9-620.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Legal restrictions on assignment generally ineffective.  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2A-303 and 9-407 and subject to subsections (h) and (i), a rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, an account or chattel paper is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, the account or chattel paper;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account or chattel paper.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Term restricting assignment generally ineffective.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a lease agreement is ineffective to the extent that it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a party to the lease to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the lease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Effectiveness of certain terms.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 2A-303(7), a term described in subsection (a)(2) is effective to the extent that there is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the term;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Security interest not material impairment.  The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor's interest under the lease contract or the lessor's residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee's prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of Section 2A-303(4) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care-insurance receivable or a general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise, and which term prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to, the assignment or transfer of, or creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in, the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, is ineffective to the extent that the term:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Applicability of subsection (a) to sales of certain rights to payment.  Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under Section 9-610 or an acceptance of collateral under Section 9-620.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Legal restrictions on assignment generally ineffective.  A rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, person obligated on a promissory note, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, a promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise between an account debtor and a debtor, is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Limitation on ineffectiveness under subsections (a) and (c).  To the extent that a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care-insurance receivable or general intangible or a rule of law, statute, or regulation described in subsection (c) would be effective under law other than this article but is ineffective under subsection (a) or (c), the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) is not enforceable against the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) does not impose a duty or obligation on the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) does not require the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to recognize the security interest, pay or render performance to the secured party, or accept payment or performance from the secured party;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) does not entitle the secured party to use or assign the debtor's rights under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including any related information or materials furnished to the debtor in the transaction giving rise to the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) does not entitle the secured party to use, assign, possess, or have access to any trade secrets or confidential information of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) does not entitle the secured party to enforce the security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Section prevails over inconsistent law.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), this section prevails over any inconsistent provision of an existing or future statute, rule, or regulation of this State unless the provision is contained in a statute of this State, refers expressly to this section, and states that the provision prevails over this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Inapplicability.  This section does not apply to an assignment or transfer of or creation of a security interest in:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a claim or right to receive compensation for injuries or sickness as described in 26 U.S.C. &sect 104(a)(1) or (2), as amended from time to time;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a claim or right to receive benefits under a special needs trust as described in 42 U.S.C. &sect 1396p(d)(4), as amended from time to time.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Term or law restricting assignment generally ineffective.  A term in a letter of credit or a rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice applicable to the letter of credit which prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of an applicant, issuer, or nominated person to a beneficiary's assignment of or creation of a security interest in a letter-of-credit right is ineffective to the extent that the term or rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the letter-of-credit right;  or
<br>

(b) Limitation on ineffectiveness under subsection (a).  To the extent that a term in a letter of credit is ineffective under subsection (a) but would be effective under law other than this article or a custom or practice applicable to the letter of credit, to the transfer of a right to draw or otherwise demand performance under the letter of credit, or to the assignment of a right to proceeds of the letter of credit, the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the letter-of-credit right:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-501 Filing Office. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Filing offices.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), if the local law of this state governs perfection of a security interest or agricultural lien, the office in which to file a financing statement to perfect the security interest or agricultural lien is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the office designated for the filing or recording of a record of a mortgage on the related real property, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the collateral is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) the financing statement is filed as a fixture filing and the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the office of the secretary of state, in all other cases, including a case in which the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures and the financing statement is not filed as a fixture filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Filing office for transmitting utilities.  The office in which to file a financing statement to perfect a security interest in collateral, including fixtures, of a transmitting utility is the office of the secretary of state.  The financing statement also constitutes a fixture filing as to the collateral indicated in the financing statement which is or is to become fixtures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-502 Contents of Financing Statement;  Record of Mortgage as Financing Statement;  Time of Filing Financing Statement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Sufficiency of financing statement.  Subject to subsection (b), a financing statement is sufficient only if it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) provides the name of the debtor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) provides the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) indicates the collateral covered by the financing statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Real-property-related financing statements.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-501(b), to be sufficient, a financing statement that covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, or which is filed as a fixture filing and covers goods that are or are to become fixtures, must satisfy subsection (a) and also:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) indicate that it covers this type of collateral;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) indicate that it is to be filed in the real property records;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) provide a description of the real property to which the collateral is related sufficient to give constructive notice of a mortgage under the law of this State if the description were contained in a record of the mortgage of the real property;  however, a reference to the municipality where the real property is located and to the book and page number of the deed by which the record owner acquired title to the real property shall be sufficient for such purpose;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) if the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real property, provide the name of a record owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Record of mortgage as financing statement.  A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the record satisfies the requirements for a financing statement in this section other than an indication that it is to be filed in the real property records;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the record is duly recorded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Filing before security agreement or attachment.  A financing statement may be filed before a security agreement is made or a security interest otherwise attaches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-503 Name of Debtor and Secured Party. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Sufficiency of debtor's name.  A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the registered organization's name;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) subject to subsection (f), if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) provides, as the name of the debtor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) if the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) if the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in a separate part of the financing statement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) if the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i), indicates that the collateral is held in a trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) if the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), provides additional information sufficient to distinguish the trust from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors or the same testator and indicates that the collateral is held in a trust, unless the additional information so indicates;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) if the debtor is an individual, only if the financing statement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) provides the individual name of the debtor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) provides the surname and first personal name of the debtor;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) subject to subsection (g), provides the name of the individual which is indicated on a driver's license or a nondriver's picture identification card that this State has issued to the individual and which has not expired;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) in other cases:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) if the debtor has a name, only if the financing statement provides the organizational name of the debtor;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) if the debtor does not have a name, only if the financing statement provides the names of the partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor, in a manner that each name provided would be sufficient if the person named were the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Additional debtor-related information.  A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (a) is not rendered ineffective by the absence of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a trade name or other name of the debtor;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) unless required under subsection (a)(5)(B), names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Debtor's trade name insufficient.  A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Representative capacity.  Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Multiple debtors and secured parties.  A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Name of decedent.  The name of the decedent indicated on the order appointing the personal representative of the decedent issued by the court having jurisdiction over the collateral is sufficient as the "name of the decedent'' under subsection (a)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Multiple driver's licenses.  If this State has issued to an individual more than one driver's license or nondriver's picture identification card of a kind described in subsection (a)(4)(C), the one that was issued most recently is the one to which subsection (a)(4)(C) refers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Definition.  In this section, the "name of the settlor or testator'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) if the settlor is a registered organization, the name that is stated to be the settlor's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the settlor's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the settlor's name;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in other cases, the name of the settlor or testator indicated in the trust's organic record.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a description of the collateral pursuant to Section 9-108;  or
<br>

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Use of terms other than "debtor'' and "secured party.''  A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in Section 9-311(a), using the terms "consignor'', "consignee'', "lessor'', "lessee'', "bailor'', "bailee'', "licensor'', "licensee'', "owner'', "registered owner'', "buyer'', "seller'', or words of similar import, instead of the terms "secured party'' and "debtor''.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Effect of financing statement under subsection (a).  This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under Section 9-311(b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation.  If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.

(a) Minor errors and omissions.  A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Financing statement seriously misleading.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section 9-503(a) is seriously misleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Financing statement not seriously misleading.  If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section 9-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-507 Effect of Certain Events on Effectiveness of Financing Statement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Disposition.  A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Information becoming seriously misleading.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and Section 9-508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Change in debtor's name.  If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under Section 9-503(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within 4 months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than 4 months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within 4 months after the financing statement became seriously misleading.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Financing statement naming original debtor.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a filed financing statement naming an original debtor is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights to the extent that the financing statement would have been effective had the original debtor acquired rights in the collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Financing statement becoming seriously misleading.  If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed financing statement that is effective under subsection (a) to be seriously misleading under Section 9-506:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under Section 9-203(d);  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor more than four months after the new debtor becomes bound under Section 9-203(d) unless an initial financing statement providing the name of the new debtor is filed before the expiration of that time.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Person entitled to file record.  A person may file an initial financing statement, amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement, or amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor authorizes the filing in an authenticated record or pursuant to subsection (b) or (c);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the person holds an agricultural lien that has become effective at the time of filing and the financing statement covers only collateral in which the person holds an agricultural lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Security agreement as authorization.  By authenticating or becoming bound as debtor by a security agreement, a debtor or new debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering:

(1) the collateral described in the security agreement;  and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-515 Duration and Effectiveness of Financing Statement;  Effect of Lapsed Financing Statement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Five-year effectiveness.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e), (f), and (g), a filed financing statement is effective for a period of 5 years after the date of filing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Public-finance or manufactured-home transaction.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g), an initial financing statement filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction is effective for a period of 30 years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Lapse and continuation of financing statement.  The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d).  Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise.  If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When continuation statement may be filed.  A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) or the 30-year period specified in subsection (b), whichever is applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Effect of filing continuation statement.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-510, upon timely filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years commencing on the day on which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing.  Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d).  Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Transmitting utility financing statement.  If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Record of mortgage as financing statement.  A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under Section 9-502(c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest or lien within a reasonable time.  Unless the holder complies, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under paragraph (1)(C).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A secured party shall account to and pay a debtor for any surplus, and the obligor is liable for any deficiency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-615 Application of Proceeds of Disposition;  Liability for Deficiency and Right to Surplus. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Application of proceeds.  A secured party shall apply or pay over for application the cash proceeds of disposition under Section 9-610 in the following order to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and disposing, and, to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the satisfaction of obligations secured by any subordinate security interest in or other subordinate lien on the collateral if:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the secured party receives from the holder of the subordinate security interest or other lien an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in a case in which a consignor has an interest in the collateral, the subordinate security interest or other lien is senior to the interest of the consignor;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) a secured party that is a consignor of the collateral if the secured party receives from the consignor an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Proof of subordinate interest.  If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest or lien within a reasonable time.  Unless the holder does so, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under subsection (a)(3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Application of noncash proceeds.  A secured party need not apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds of disposition under Section 9-610 unless the failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable.  A secured party that applies or pays over for application noncash proceeds shall do so in a commercially reasonable manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Surplus or deficiency if obligation secured.  If the security interest under which a disposition is made secures payment or performance of an obligation, after making the payments and applications required by subsection (a) and permitted by subsection (c):  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) unless subsection (a)(4) requires the secured party to apply or pay over cash proceeds to a consignor, the secured party shall account to and pay a debtor for any surplus;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the obligor is liable for any deficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) No surplus or deficiency in sales of certain rights to payment.  If the underlying transaction is a sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor is not entitled to any surplus;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the obligor is not liable for any deficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Calculation of surplus or deficiency in disposition to person related to secured party.  The surplus or deficiency following a disposition is calculated based on the amount of proceeds that would have been realized in a disposition complying with this part to a transferee other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor if:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the transferee in the disposition is the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of proceeds that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Cash proceeds received by junior secured party.  A secured party that receives cash proceeds of a disposition in good faith and without knowledge that the receipt violates the rights of the holder of a security interest or other lien that is not subordinate to the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) takes the cash proceeds free of the security interest or other lien;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) is not obligated to apply the proceeds of the disposition to the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or other lien;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) is not obligated to account to or pay the holder of the security interest or other lien for any surplus.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-617 Rights of Transferee of Collateral. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Effects of disposition.  A secured party's disposition of collateral after default:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) transfers to a transferee for value all of the debtor's rights in the collateral;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) discharges the security interest under which the disposition is made;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) discharges any subordinate security interest or other subordinate lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Rights of good-faith transferee.  A transferee that acts in good faith takes free of the rights and interests described in subsection (a), even if the secured party fails to comply with this article or the requirements of any judicial proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Rights of other transferee.  If a transferee does not take free of the rights and interests described in subsection (a), the transferee takes the collateral subject to:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor's rights in the collateral;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) any other security interest or other lien.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Rights and duties of secondary obligor.  A secondary obligor acquires the rights and becomes obligated to perform the duties of the secured party after the secondary obligor:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) receives an assignment of a secured obligation from the secured party;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) receives a transfer of collateral from the secured party and agrees to accept the rights and assume the duties of the secured party;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) is subrogated to the rights of a secured party with respect to collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Effect of assignment, transfer, or subrogation.  An assignment, transfer, or subrogation described in subsection (a):  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) is not a disposition of collateral under Section 9-610;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) relieves the secured party of further duties under this article.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-619 Transfer of Record or Legal Title. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Transfer statement.''  In this section, "transfer statement'' means a record authenticated by a secured party stating:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) that the debtor has defaulted in connection with an obligation secured by specified collateral;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) that the secured party has exercised its post-default remedies with respect to the collateral;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) that, by reason of the exercise, a transferee has acquired the rights of the debtor in the collateral;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the name and mailing address of the secured party, debtor, and transferee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Effect of transfer statement.  A transfer statement entitles the transferee to the transfer of record of all rights of the debtor in the collateral specified in the statement in any official filing, recording, registration, or certificate-of-title system covering the collateral.  If a transfer statement is presented with the applicable fee and request form to the official or office responsible for maintaining the system, the official or office shall:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) accept the transfer statement;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) promptly amend its records to reflect the transfer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if applicable, issue a new appropriate certificate of title in the name of the transferee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Transfer not a disposition;  no relief of secured party's duties.  A transfer of the record or legal title to collateral to a secured party under subsection (b) or otherwise is not of itself a disposition of collateral under this article and does not of itself relieve the secured party of its duties under this article.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Conditions to acceptance in satisfaction.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a secured party may accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the secured party does not receive, within the time set forth in subsection (d), a notification of objection to the proposal authenticated by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) a person to which the secured party was required to send a proposal under Section 9-621;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) any other person, other than the debtor, holding an interest in the collateral subordinate to the security interest that is the subject of the proposal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if the collateral is consumer goods, the collateral is not in the possession of the debtor when the debtor consents to the acceptance;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) subsection (e) does not require the secured party to dispose of the collateral or the debtor waives the requirement pursuant to Section 9-624.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Purported acceptance ineffective.  A purported or apparent acceptance of collateral under this section is ineffective unless:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the secured party consents to the acceptance in an authenticated record or sends a proposal to the debtor;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the conditions of subsection (a) are met.
<br>

<br>

<center><h3>Section 382-A:9-625</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-625 Remedies for Secured Party's Failure to Comply With Article. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Judicial orders concerning noncompliance.  If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this article, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement, or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Damages for noncompliance.  Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (f), a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this article.  Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Persons entitled to recover damages;  statutory damages if collateral is consumer goods.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-628:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) for its loss;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) if the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus 10 percent of the principal amount of the obligation or the time-price differential plus 10 percent of the cash price.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Recovery when deficiency eliminated or reduced.  A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under Section 9-626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus.  However, a debtor or secondary obligor whose deficiency is eliminated or reduced under Section 9-626 may not otherwise recover under subsection (b) for noncompliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Statutory damages:  noncompliance with specified provisions.  In addition to any damages recoverable under subsection (b), the debtor, consumer obligor, or person named as a debtor in a filed record, as applicable, may recover $500 in each case from a person that:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) fails to comply with Section 9-208;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) fails to comply with Section 9-209;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) files a record that the person is not entitled to file under Section 9-509(a);  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) fails to cause the secured party of record to file or send a termination statement as required by Section 9-513(a) or (c);  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) fails to comply with Section 9-616(b)(1) and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) fails to comply with Section 9-616(b)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Statutory damages:  noncompliance with Section 9-210.  A debtor or consumer obligor may recover damages under subsection (b) and, in addition, $500 in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with a request under Section 9-210.  A recipient of a request under Section 9-210 which never claimed an interest in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under that section has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within the meaning of this subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Limitation of security interest:  noncompliance with Section 9-210.  If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under Section 9-210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-626 Action in Which Deficiency or Surplus is in Issue. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Applicable rules if amount of deficiency or surplus in issue.  In an action arising from a transaction, other than a consumer transaction, in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this part.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-628, if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees exceeds the greater of:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) the amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(B), the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under Section 9-615(f), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Non-consumer transactions;  no inference.  The limitation of the rules in subsection (a) to transactions other than consumer transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer transactions.  The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-627 Determination of Whether Conduct Was Commercially Reasonable. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Greater amount obtainable under other circumstances;  no preclusion of commercial reasonableness.  The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Dispositions that are commercially reasonable.  A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in the usual manner on any recognized market;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) at the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Approval by court or on behalf of creditors.  A collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in a judicial proceeding;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) by a bona fide creditors' committee;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) by a representative of creditors;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) by an assignee for the benefit of creditors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Approval under subsection (c) not necessary;  absence of approval has no effect.  Approval under subsection (c) need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is not commercially reasonable.

(1) the secured party is not liable to the person, or to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against the person, for failure to comply with this article;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the secured party's failure to comply with this article does not affect the liability of the person for a deficiency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Limitation of liability based on status as secured party.  A secured party is not liable because of its status as secured party:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) to a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) that the person is a debtor or obligor;

(B) the identity of the person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Limitation of liability if reasonable belief that transaction not a consumer-goods transaction or consumer transaction.  A secured party is not liable to any person, and a person's liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission arising out of the secured party's reasonable belief that a transaction is not a consumer-goods transaction or a consumer transaction or that goods are not consumer goods, if the secured party's belief is based on its reasonable reliance on:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a debtor's representation concerning the purpose for which collateral was to be used, acquired, or held;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) an obligor's representation concerning the purpose for which a secured obligation was incurred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Limitation of liability for statutory damages.  A secured party is not liable to any person under Section 9-625(c)(2) for its failure to comply with Section 9-616.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-705 Effectiveness of Action Taken Before Effective Date. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Pre-effective-date action;  one-year perfection period unless reperfected.  If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before this Act takes effect and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before this Act takes effect, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this Act within one year after this Act takes effect.  An attached security interest becomes unperfected one year after this Act takes effect unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this Act before the expiration of that period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Pre-effective-date filing.  The filing of a financing statement before this Act takes effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Pre-effective-date filing in jurisdiction formerly governing perfection.  Except as provided in subsection (g), this Act does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Section 9-103 of former Article 9.  However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) and Section 9-706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) June 30, 2006.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Continuation statement.  The filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before this Act takes effect.  However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before this Act takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Application of subsection (c)(2) to transmitting utility financing statement.  Subsection (c)(2) applies to a financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Section 9-103 of former Article 9 only to the extent that Part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Application of Part 5.  A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect and a continuation statement filed after this Act takes effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Pre-effective-date dual filings.  A financing statement filed before this Act takes effect in a municipal clerk's office pursuant to Section 9-401( 1)(c) of former Article 9 shall no longer be effective.  The related financing statement filed in the office of the secretary of state shall remain effective, subject to subsection (c).
