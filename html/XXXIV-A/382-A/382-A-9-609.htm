(1) may take possession of the collateral;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) without removal, may render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a debtor's premises under Section 9-610.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Judicial and nonjudicial process.  A secured party may proceed under subsection (a):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) pursuant to judicial process;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) without judicial process, if it proceeds without breach of the peace.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Assembly of collateral.  If so agreed, and in any event after default, a secured party may require the debtor to assemble the collateral and make it available to the secured party at a place to be designated by the secured party which is reasonably convenient to both parties.
