<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless subsection (c) applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subject to subsection (d), a claim is not discharged under subsection (b) if either of the following applies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The claimant, if an organization, proves that (i) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office, or place, and (ii) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received by that designated person, office, or place.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that within 90 days after payment of the instrument, the claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against whom the claim is asserted.
