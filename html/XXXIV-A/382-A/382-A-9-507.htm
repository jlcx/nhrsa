&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-507 Effect of Certain Events on Effectiveness of Financing Statement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Disposition.  A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Information becoming seriously misleading.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and Section 9-508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Change in debtor's name.  If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under Section 9-503(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within 4 months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than 4 months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within 4 months after the financing statement became seriously misleading.
