&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:7-104 Negotiable and Nonnegotiable Document of Title. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a document of title is negotiable if by its terms the goods are to be delivered to bearer or to the order of a named person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A document of title other than one described in subsection (a) is nonnegotiable.  A bill of lading that states that the goods are consigned to a named person is not made negotiable by a provision that the goods are to be delivered only against an order in a record signed by the same or another named person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A document of title is nonnegotiable if, at the time it is issued, the document has a conspicuous legend, however expressed, that it is nonnegotiable.
