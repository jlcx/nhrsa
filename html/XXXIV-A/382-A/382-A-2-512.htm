<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Where the contract requires payment before inspection non-conformity of the goods does not excuse the buyer from so making payment unless
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) the non-conformity appears without inspection;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) despite tender of the required documents the circumstances would justify injunction against honor under this chapter (Section 5-109(b)).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Payment pursuant to subsection (1) does not constitute an acceptance of goods or impair the buyer's right to inspect or any of his remedies.
