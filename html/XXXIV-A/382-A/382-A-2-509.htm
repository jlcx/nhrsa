(1) Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) if it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.

<br>

(a) on his or her receipt of possession or control of a negotiable document of title covering the goods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
