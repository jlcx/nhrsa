&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An aggrieved seller under the preceding section may
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) identify to the contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time he learned of the breach they are in his possession or control;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) treat as the subject of resale goods which have demonstrably been intended for the particular contract even though those goods are unfinished.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
