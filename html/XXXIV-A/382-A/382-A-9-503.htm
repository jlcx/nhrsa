<codesect>
(a) Sufficiency of debtor's name.  A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the registered organization's name;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) subject to subsection (f), if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) provides, as the name of the debtor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) if the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) if the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in a separate part of the financing statement:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) if the debtor is an individual, only if the financing statement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) provides the individual name of the debtor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(c) Debtor's trade name insufficient.  A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Representative capacity.  Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
