&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Security interest in fixtures under this article.  A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures.  A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Security interest in fixtures under real-property law.  This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) General rule:  subordination of security interest in fixtures.  In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Fixtures purchase-money priority.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the security interest is a purchase-money security interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Priority of security interest in fixtures over interests in real property.  A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) factory or office machines;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Priority based on consent, disclaimer, or right to remove.  A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Continuation of paragraph (f)(2) priority.  The priority of the security interest under paragraph (f)(2) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Priority of construction mortgage.  A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction.  A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Priority of security interest in crops.  A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property.
