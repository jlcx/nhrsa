<codesect>
The following rules apply in an action on a certificated security against the issuer:
<br>

(1) Unless specifically denied in the pleadings, each signature on a security certificate or in a necessary indorsement is admitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If signatures on a security certificate are admitted or established, production of the certificate entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense or a defect going to the validity of the security.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If it is shown that a defense or defect exists, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the plaintiff or some person under whom the plaintiff claims is a person against whom the defense or defect cannot be asserted.
