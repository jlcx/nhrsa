&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:9-105 Control Of Electronic Chattel Paper. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) General rule:  control of electronic chattel paper.  A secured party has control of electronic chattel paper if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the chattel paper reliably establishes the secured party as the person to which the chattel paper was assigned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Specific facts giving control.  A system satisfies subsection (a) if the record or records comprising the chattel paper are created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a single authoritative copy of the record or records exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the authoritative copy identifies the secured party as the assignee of the record or records;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the secured party or its designated custodian;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) copies or amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the secured party;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) any amendment of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.
