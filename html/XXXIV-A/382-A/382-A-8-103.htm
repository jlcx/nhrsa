&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:8-103 Rules for Determining Whether Certain Obligations and Interests are Securities or Financial Assets. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock company, or similar entity is a security.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An "investment company security'' is a security.  "Investment company security'' means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered.  Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this Article, or it is an investment company security.  However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this Article and not by Article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that Article.  However, a negotiable instrument governed by Article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A commodity contract, as defined in Section 9-102(a)(15), is not a security or a financial asset.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A document of title is not a financial asset unless Section 8-102(a)(9)(iii) applies.
