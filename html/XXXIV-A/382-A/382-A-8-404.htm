<codesect>
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8-406, an issuer is liable for wrongful registration of transfer if the issuer has registered a transfer of a security to a person not entitled to it, and the transfer was registered:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) pursuant to an ineffective indorsement or instruction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) after a demand that the issuer not register transfer became effective under Section 8-403(a) and the issuer did not comply with Section 8-403(b);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) after the issuer had been served with an injunction, restraining order, or other legal process enjoining it from registering the transfer, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the issuer had a reasonable opportunity to act on the injunction, restraining order, or other legal process;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) by an issuer acting in collusion with the wrongdoer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An issuer that is liable for wrongful registration of transfer under subsection (a) on demand shall provide the person entitled to the security with a like certificated or uncertificated security, and any payments or distributions that the person did not receive as a result of the wrongful registration.  If an overissue would result, the issuer's liability to provide the person with a like security is governed by Section 8-210.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) or in a law relating to the collection of taxes, an issuer is not liable to an owner or other person suffering loss as a result of the registration of a transfer of a security if registration was made pursuant to an effective indorsement or instruction.
