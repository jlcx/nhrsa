&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:2A-217 Identification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties.  In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) when the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) when the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) when the young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals.
