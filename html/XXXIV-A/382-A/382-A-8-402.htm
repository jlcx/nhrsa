&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:8-402 Assurance That Indorsement or Instruction is Effective. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) An issuer may require the following assurance that each necessary indorsement or each instruction is genuine and authorized:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in all cases, a guaranty of the signature of the person making an indorsement or originating an instruction including, in the case of an instruction, reasonable assurance of identity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) if the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by an agent, appropriate assurance of actual authority to sign;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by a fiduciary pursuant to Section 8-107(a) (4) or (a) (5), appropriate evidence of appointment or incumbency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) if there is more than one fiduciary, reasonable assurance that all who are required to sign have done so;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) if the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by a person not covered by another provision of this subsection, assurance appropriate to the case corresponding as nearly as may be to the provisions of this subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An issuer may elect to require reasonable assurance beyond that specified in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Guaranty of the signature'' means a guaranty signed by or on behalf of a person reasonably believed by the issuer to be responsible.  An issuer may adopt standards with respect to responsibility if they are not manifestly unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Appropriate evidence of appointment or incumbency'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) in the case of a fiduciary appointed or qualified by a court, a certificate issued by or under the direction or supervision of the court or an officer thereof and dated within 60 days before the date of presentation for transfer;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) in any other case, a copy of a document showing the appointment or a certificate issued by or on behalf of a person reasonably believed by an issuer to be responsible or, in the absence of that document or certificate, other evidence the issuer reasonably considers appropriate.
