&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:5-118 Security Interest of Issuer or Nominated Person. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) An issuer or nominated person has a security interest in a document presented under a letter of credit to the extent that the issuer or nominated person honors or gives value for the presentation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) So long as and to the extent that an issuer or nominated person has not been reimbursed or has not otherwise recovered the value given with respect to a security interest in a document under subsection (a), the security interest continues and is subject to Article 9, but:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a security agreement is not necessary to make the security interest enforceable under Section 9-203(b)(3);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) if the document is presented in a medium other than a written or other tangible medium, the security interest is perfected;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if the document is presented in a written or other tangible medium and is not a certificated security, chattel paper, a document of title, an instrument, or a letter of credit, the security interest is perfected and has priority over a conflicting security interest in the document so long as the debtor does not have possession of the document.
