<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Conditions to acceptance in satisfaction.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a secured party may accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c);  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the secured party does not receive, within the time set forth in subsection (d), a notification of objection to the proposal authenticated by:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) a person to which the secured party was required to send a proposal under Section 9-621;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) any other person, other than the debtor, holding an interest in the collateral subordinate to the security interest that is the subject of the proposal;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) if the collateral is consumer goods, the collateral is not in the possession of the debtor when the debtor consents to the acceptance;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) subsection (e) does not require the secured party to dispose of the collateral or the debtor waives the requirement pursuant to Section 9-624.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Purported acceptance ineffective.  A purported or apparent acceptance of collateral under this section is ineffective unless:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the secured party consents to the acceptance in an authenticated record or sends a proposal to the debtor;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the conditions of subsection (a) are met.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Debtor's consent.  For purposes of this section:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a debtor consents to an acceptance of collateral in partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if the debtor agrees to the terms of the acceptance in a record authenticated after default;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a debtor consents to an acceptance of collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if the debtor agrees to the terms of the acceptance in a record authenticated after default or the secured party:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) sends to the debtor after default a proposal that is unconditional or subject only to a condition that collateral not in the possession of the secured party be preserved or maintained;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in the proposal, proposes to accept collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) does not receive a notification of objection authenticated by the debtor within 20 days after the proposal is sent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Effectiveness of notification.  To be effective under subsection (a)( 2), a notification of objection must be received by the secured party:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in the case of a person to which the proposal was sent pursuant to Section 9-621, within 20 days after notification was sent to that person;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in other cases:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) within 20 days after the last notification was sent pursuant to Section 9-621;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) if a notification was not sent, before the debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Mandatory disposition of consumer goods.  A secured party that has taken possession of collateral shall dispose of the collateral pursuant to Section 9-610 within the time specified in subsection (f) if:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) 60 percent of the cash price has been paid in the case of a purchase- money security interest in consumer goods;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) 60 percent of the principal amount of the obligation secured has been paid in the case of a non-purchase-money security interest in consumer goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Compliance with mandatory disposition requirement.  To comply with subsection (e), the secured party shall dispose of the collateral:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) within 90 days after taking possession;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) within any longer period to which the debtor and all secondary obligors have agreed in an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
