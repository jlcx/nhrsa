&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 382-A:4-106 Payable Through or Payable at Bank:  Collecting Bank. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If an item states that it is "payable through'' a bank identified in the item, (i) the item designates the bank as a collecting bank and does not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item, and (ii) the item may be presented for payment only by or through the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If an item states that it is "payable at'' a bank identified in the item, the item is equivalent to a draft drawn on the bank.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a draft names a nonbank drawee and it is unclear whether a bank named in the draft is a co-drawee or a collecting bank, the bank is a collecting bank.
