<codesect>
(a) If a certificated security in registered form is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer or an instruction is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer of an uncertificated security, the issuer shall register the transfer as requested if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) under the terms of the security the person seeking registration of transfer is eligible to have the security registered in its name;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the indorsement or instruction is made by the appropriate person or by an agent who has actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) reasonable assurance is given that the indorsement or instruction is genuine and authorized (Section 8-402);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) any applicable law relating to the collection of taxes has been complied with;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) the transfer does not violate any restriction on transfer imposed by the issuer in accordance with Section 8-204;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) a demand that the issuer not register transfer has not become effective under Section 8-403, or the issuer has complied with Section 8-403(b) but no legal process or indemnity bond is obtained as provided in Section 8-403(d);  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) the transfer is in fact rightful or is to a protected purchaser.
<br>
