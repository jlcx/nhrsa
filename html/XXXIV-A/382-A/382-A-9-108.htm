<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Sufficiency of description.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e), a description of personal or real property is sufficient, whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Examples of reasonable identification.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), a description of collateral reasonably identifies the collateral if it identifies the collateral by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) specific listing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) category;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a type of collateral defined in this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) quantity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) computational or allocational formula or procedure;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any other method, if the identity of the collateral is objectively determinable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Supergeneric description not sufficient.  A description of collateral as "all the debtor's assets'' or "all the debtor's personal property'' or using words of similar import does not reasonably identify the collateral.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Investment property.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a description of a security entitlement, securities account, or commodity account is sufficient if it describes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the collateral by those terms or as investment property;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the underlying financial asset or commodity contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When description by type insufficient.  A description only by type of collateral defined in this chapter is an insufficient description of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a commercial tort claim;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in a consumer transaction, consumer goods, a security entitlement, a securities account, or a commodity account.
