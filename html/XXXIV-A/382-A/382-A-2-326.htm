(1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) a "sale on approval'' if the goods are delivered primarily for use, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) a "sale or return'' if the goods are delivered primarily for resale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance;  goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any "or return'' term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this Article (Section 2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (Section 2-202).
