(a) "Possessory lien.''  In this section, "possessory lien'' means an interest, other than a security interest or an agricultural lien:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) which secures payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of the person's business;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) which is created by statute or rule of law in favor of the person;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) whose effectiveness depends on the person's possession of the goods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Priority of possessory lien.  A possessory lien on goods has priority over a security interest in the goods unless the lien is created by a statute that expressly provides otherwise.
