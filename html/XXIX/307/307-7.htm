<codesect>
If any such meetinghouse is so owned that the provisions of RSA 307:1-6 will not apply, or it is doubtful whether they will apply, the superior court, upon petition of any party interested therein, after due notice and a hearing of all parties in interest who desire to be heard, may order it to be sold and appoint a receiver for the purpose, and may make such further orders as may be necessary to complete the sale and divide the proceeds among the parties according to their respective interests in the property sold.
