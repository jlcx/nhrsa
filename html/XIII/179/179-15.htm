&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 179:15 Transportation of Beverages and Wine. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A person may transport or deliver beverages and wines in this state without a license, provided such beverages and wines were obtained as authorized by this title and provided such beverages and wines are for consumption only and not for resale purposes.  Licensees may transport and deliver to their place of business beverages and wines purchased as authorized under this title, and, except on-premises licensees, may transport and deliver anywhere in the state such beverages and wines ordered from and sold by them in vehicles operated under the control of themselves or of their employees or agents, provided that the owner of such vehicles shall carry a copy of the license issued by the commission in the vehicle driven on behalf of the licensee for whom they are transporting such beverages and wines.  Every person operating such a vehicle, when engaged in such transportation or delivery, shall carry a copy of the license in the vehicle so operated, and shall carry such evidence as the commission by rule may prescribe showing the origin and destination of the beverages and wines being transported or delivered.  Upon demand of any law enforcement officer, investigator, or employee of the commission, the person operating such vehicle shall produce for inspection a copy of the license and the evidence required by this section.  Failure to produce such license or evidence shall constitute prima facie evidence of unlawful transportation.  Except as otherwise provided, beverages and wines may be transported within the state only by a railroad or steamboat corporation or by a person regularly and lawfully conducting a general express or trucking business, and in each case holding a valid carrier's license issued by the commission.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit individual retail licensees from arranging for the delivery of wine products to a location central for the parties involved.
