I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any food service business holding an on-premises license may allow any person who has purchased a full course meal and purchased and partially consumed a bottle of table wine with said meal, to remove such partially consumed bottle from the premises upon departure, provided that the person is not in a state of intoxication as defined in RSA 507-F:1, IV and such bottle of table wine is removed and transported in a manner consistent with paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any partially consumed bottle of table wine which is to be removed from the premises under paragraph I shall be securely sealed and bagged, by the licensee, either to be in conformance with any applicable local open container law for those patrons on foot, or transported as required by RSA 265-A:44, in the trunk of a motor vehicle.  If the vehicle is not equipped with a trunk, the securely sealed opened table wine bottles may be stored and transported in that compartment or area of the vehicle which is the least accessible to the driver.
