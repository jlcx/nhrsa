<codesect>
The establishment of all the following facts by a person making a sale of liquor or beverage to a person under the age of 21 shall constitute prima facie evidence of innocence and a defense to any prosecution for such sale:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. That the person falsely represented in writing and supported by some official document that he was 21 years of age or over;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. That the appearance of the person was such that an ordinary and prudent person would believe him to be 21 years of age or over;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. That the sale was made in good faith relying upon such written representation and appearance in the reasonable belief that the person was actually 21 years of age or over.
