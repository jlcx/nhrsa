If any licensee violates any of the provisions of law or any of the rules of the commission adopted under this title or fails to superintend in person or through a manager approved by the commission the business for which the license was issued or allows the premises with respect to which the license was issued to be used for any unlawful purposes or knowingly designates to be in charge of the premises any person who has been convicted of a felony, unless the person has been approved by the commission pursuant to RSA 179:23, V, or otherwise fails to carry out in good faith the purposes of this title or if the premises are regularly the site of violence the license of such licensee may be suspended or revoked after notice and hearing, in accordance with RSA 541-A:31-36.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the commission after the appropriate hearing may impose a fine of a specific sum, which shall not be less than $100 nor more than $5,000 for any one offense.
