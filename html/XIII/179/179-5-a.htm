I. The commission by rule shall require the identification of kegs of malt beverages sold directly to consumers who are not licensees of the commission and the signing of a receipt therefor by the purchaser in order to allow the kegs to be traced if the contents are consumed in violation of the Title XIII.  The keg identification shall be in a form prescribed by the commission which identifies the seller and which is removable or obliterated when the keg is processed for refilling.  The receipt shall be on a form prescribed and supplied by the commission and shall include the purchaser's name, address, and motor vehicle operator's license number, if any.  The receipt shall contain a statement that shall be signed by the purchaser that, under penalty of unsworn falsification, the purchaser shall not allow consumption of any malt beverage in the keg in violation of the provisions of RSA 179:5.  A copy of the receipt shall be given to the purchaser and the seller shall retain the original receipt for such period as the commission by rule may require.
