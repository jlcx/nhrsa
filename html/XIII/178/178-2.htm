I. The commission may issue licenses to individuals, partnerships, limited liability companies and partnerships, or corporations but not to unincorporated associations, on applications duly made therefor for the manufacture, warehousing, sale, offer for sale, or solicitation of orders for sale of liquor or beverages and for retail sales of tobacco products within the state, subject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by this title.  The commission shall keep a full record of all applications for licenses, of all recommendations for and remonstrances against the granting of licenses, and of the action taken on such applications.

II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission shall require all persons who hold a retail license under the provisions of this chapter to attend a training program within 45 calendar days of the issuance of the license.  These provisions shall not apply to any person who holds a retail license on the effective date of this paragraph.  The commission shall provide the training program without additional fees or cost to the licensee.  The commission shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the administration of the training program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission shall develop and provide a training program which shall include, but not be limited to, information on state law, alcohol sales practices, criminal and civil liability, and management practices which are intended to reduce access to alcohol by persons under the age of 21 and overservice of alcohol to patrons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prior to the effective date of a one-day license, the training program shall be attended by a management representative of the applicant. If 2 or more one-day licenses are issued to the same applicant during any 12-month period, the management representative of the applicant shall be required to attend the training program only once during that 12-month period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commission may suspend, pursuant to RSA 541-A:30, III, the license of any person who holds a license under the provisions of this chapter for failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph IV. The license shall not be reissued until the required training is completed.
