<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Off-premises licenses shall be issued only for grocery and drug stores not holding on-premises licenses.  Such licenses shall authorize the licensees to sell fortified wine, table wine, and beverages for consumption only off the premises designated in the licenses and not to other licensees for resale.  Such sale shall be made only in the immediate container in which the beverage, wine, or fortified wine was received by the off-premises combination licensee;  except that in the case of the holder of a wholesale distributor license, beverages may be sold only in such barrels, bottles, or other containers as the commission may by rule prescribe.  Off-premises licenses may also authorize the licensee to sell tobacco products.  There shall be no restriction on the number of combination licenses held by any person.  The license shall authorize the licensee to transport and deliver beverages, tobacco products, and table or fortified wines ordered from and sold by the licensee in vehicles operated under the licensee's control or an employee's control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All sales of tobacco, beverages, fortified wines, and table wine shall be recorded on cash registers.  No additional registers shall be added during the remainder of the year without prior approval of the commission.  No rebate shall be allowed for cash registers discontinued during the license year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission may suspend the tobacco or alcohol sales portion of the license separately under the provisions of RSA 179:57;  any revocation shall revoke the entire license.
