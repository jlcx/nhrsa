&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commission is hereby authorized and directed to enter into contracts for the manufacture and purchase of commemorative bottles of historic significance, and pamphlets describing their historical significance.  The commission shall add a special markup including the cost of the pamphlets to the cost of the bottles, above its customary markups for retail sales.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All revenue from these special markups shall be reported separately by the commission and, after the cost of the pamphlets is subtracted, shall be credited to the legislative appropriation and kept as a special non-lapsing fund to be known as the historical fund.  The historical fund shall be within the oversight of the legislative historical committee established in RSA 17-I:1.  No part of the fund shall be transferred or expended for any purpose except by the historical committee in carrying out its responsibilities under RSA 17-I.
