&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 180:9 Exclusive Wholesale Distributor Territorial Agreements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It shall be unlawful for a wholesale distributor, brew pub, or beverage manufacturer to sell any brand of beverage in this state except in the territory described in a distribution agreement authorizing sale of that brand or label within a designated area, and within that designated area the wholesale distributor, brew pub, or beverage manufacturer shall service all dealer and retailer licensees without discrimination.  The distribution agreement shall be in writing and shall specify the brand or label it covers.  When a beverage manufacturer or beverage vendor sells several brands, the agreement need not apply to all brands sold by the beverage manufacturer or beverage vendor and may apply only to one brand.  No beverage manufacturer, brew pub, beverage vendor, or other supplier shall provide by the written distribution agreement for the distribution of a brand or label to more than one distributor for all or any part of the designated territory.
