<codesect>
Every beverage wholesale distributor shall service, for the purpose of quality control, all of the beverages it sells to its retailers.  Each such wholesale distributor shall provide such additional quality control services and comply with such additional quality control standards as are from time to time specified in writing by the owner of the trademark of the brand or label of beverage, provided that such activities or standards are reasonable and are reasonably related to the maintenance of quality control.  An exclusive territorial designation in any distribution agreement shall be changed only upon the written consent of the beverage manufacturer, beverage vendor, or brew pub, as applicable, and the wholesale distributor, and shall be filed pursuant to RSA 180:10, and the commission shall require each party to verify that the level of service within the designated territory shall not be affected by such change.
