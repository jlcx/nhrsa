&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, the state treasurer shall credit all gross revenue derived by the commission from the sale of liquor, or from license fees, and interest received on such moneys, to a special fund, to be known as the liquor commission fund, from which the treasurer shall pay all expenses of the commission incident to the administration of this title.  Any balance left in such fund after such expenses are paid shall be deposited in the general fund on a daily basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any provision of law, or the designation of the funds allocated by the state to the liquor commission as the liquor commission fund, the general court shall retain budgeting authority and control over the liquor commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. 1.7 percent of the previous fiscal year gross profits derived by the commission from the sale of liquor shall be deposited into the alcohol abuse prevention and treatment fund established by RSA 176-A:1.  For the purpose of this section, gross profit shall be defined as total operating revenue minus the cost of sales and services as presented in the state of New Hampshire comprehensive annual financial report, statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position for proprietary funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the expenditure of additional funds over budget estimates is necessary for the proper funding of retirement and health benefits for commission employees, the commissioner may request, with prior approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, that the governor and council authorize the transfer of funds from the liquor commission fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner is authorized to transfer funds within and among all accounting units within the commission's operating budget and to create accounting units and expenditure classes as required and as the commissioner deems necessary and appropriate to address present or projected budget deficits, or to respond to changes in federal law, regulations, or programs, and otherwise as necessary for the efficient management of the liquor commission.  Any individual transfer of $75,000 or more shall require prior approval of the fiscal committee of the general court and governor and council, and any determination of this prior approval requirement shall not be determined on a cumulative basis.  The provisions of this section shall not be subject to RSA 9:16-a, RSA 9:17-a, and RSA 9:17-c.
