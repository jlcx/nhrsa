&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph II, the state treasurer shall credit all gross revenue derived by the commission from the sale of liquor, or from license fees, and interest received on such moneys, to a special fund, to be known as the liquor commission fund, from which the treasurer shall pay all expenses of the commission incident to the administration of this title.  Any balance left in such fund after such expenses are paid shall be deposited in the general fund on a daily basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any provision of law, or the designation of the funds allocated by the state to the liquor commission as the liquor commission fund, the general court shall retain budgeting authority and control over the liquor commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Fifty percent of the amount by which the current year gross profits exceed fiscal year 2001 actual gross profit, but not more than 5 percent of the current year gross profits derived by the commission from the sale of liquor and other revenues, shall be deposited into the alcohol abuse prevention and treatment fund established by RSA 176-A:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the expenditure of additional funds over budget estimates is necessary for the proper funding of retirement and health benefits for commission employees, the commission may request, with prior approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, that the governor and council authorize the transfer of funds from the liquor commission fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commission may transfer funds totaling up to 5 percent of the operating budget in any fiscal year for any specific purposes to funds for other purposes within and among the appropriations for the operation of the commission.  The commission shall report annually 60 days after the close of each fiscal year to the fiscal committee of the general court all transfers accomplished under the provisions of this section.  The provisions of this section shall not be subject to RSA 9:16-a, RSA 9:17-a, and RSA 9:17-c.
