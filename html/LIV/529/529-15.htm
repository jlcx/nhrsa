&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 529:15 Excessive Levy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever the sum at which the real estate was set off is larger than it should have been by reason of an error, made without fraudulent intent, in computing the debt or damages or the taxable costs mentioned in the execution, or interest or the officer's fees in making the levy, the debtor may redeem by paying or tendering, according to the provisions of RSA 529:14, the sum justly due to the creditor after correcting such error.
