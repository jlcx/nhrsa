<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any time after property has been paid or delivered to the administrator under this chapter, another state may recover the property if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The property was subjected to custody by this state because the records of the holder did not reflect the last known address of the apparent owner when the property was presumed abandoned under this chapter, and the other state establishes that the last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property was in that state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property, as reflected by the records of the holder, is in the other state and under the laws of the state the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The records of the holder were erroneous in that they did not accurately reflect the actual owner of the property and the last known address of the actual owner is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The property was subjected to custody by this state under RSA 471-C:3, VI and under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The property is the sum payable on a travelers check, money order, or other similar instrument that was subjected to custody by this state under RSA 471-C:4, and that instrument was purchased in the other state, and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or became subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The claim of another state to recover escheated or abandoned property must be presented in a form prescribed by the administrator, who shall decide the claim within 90 days after it is presented.  The administrator shall allow the claim if the administrator determines that the other state is entitled to the abandoned property under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The administrator shall require a state, before recovering property under this section, to agree to indemnify this state and its officers and employees against any liability on a claim for the property.
