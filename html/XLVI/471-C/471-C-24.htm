<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraphs II and III, the administrator, within one year after the receipt of abandoned property, shall sell it to the highest bidder at public sale in whatever city in the state affords in the judgment of the administrator the most favorable market for the property involved.  The administrator may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if in the judgment of the administrator the bid is insufficient.  If in the judgment of the administrator the probable cost of sale exceeds the value of the property it need not be offered for sale.  Any sale held under this section shall be preceded by notice sent via regular mail to the last known address of the property owner at least 30 days in advance of sale and a single publication of notice, at least 3 weeks in advance of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is to be sold.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Securities listed on an established stock exchange shall be sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale on the exchange.  Other securities may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any other method the administrator considers advisable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unless the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, all securities, other than those presumed abandoned under RSA 471-C:10, delivered to the administrator shall be held for at least one year before the administrator may sell them.  Sales of securities shall be preceded by regular mail notice as set forth in paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, all securities presumed abandoned under RSA 471-C:10 and delivered to the administrator shall be held for at least one year before the administrator may sell them.  If the administrator sells any securities delivered pursuant to RSA 471-C:10 before the expiration of the one-year period, any person making a claim pursuant to this chapter before the end of the one-year period is entitled to either the proceeds of the sale of the securities or the market value of the securities at the time the claim is made, whichever amount is greater, less any deduction for fees pursuant to RSA 471-C:25, II.  A person making a claim under this chapter after the expiration of this period is entitled to receive either the securities delivered to the administrator by the holder, if they still remain in the hands of the administrator, or the proceeds received from sale, less any amount deducted pursuant to RSA 471-C:25, II, but no person has any claim under this chapter against the state, the holder, any transfer agent, registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder for any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the administrator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The purchaser of property at any sale conducted by the administrator pursuant to this chapter takes the property free of all claims of the owner or previous holder thereof and of all persons claiming through or under them.  The administrator shall execute all documents necessary to complete the transfer of ownership.
