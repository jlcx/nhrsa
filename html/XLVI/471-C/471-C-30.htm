I. Within 36 months after the close of the state's fiscal year in which any property presumed abandoned under this chapter is paid or delivered to the administrator, if no claim for the property has been made and established by any person, not including another state, entitled to the property and notice pursuant to RSA 471-C:20 has occurred, the administrator shall pay or deliver all such property to the appropriate county treasurer as required under RSA 471-C:31, subject to the state deduction under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before the administrator pays or delivers the property to the general fund or the appropriate county treasurer as required under paragraph I and RSA 471-C:31, the administrator shall retain 15 percent of the amount to be returned as a deduction for any costs and service charges which the state shall incur in escheat proceedings or with respect to reimbursements made pursuant to paragraph III.  The administrator shall deposit this sum in the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any holder of a travelers check, bearer bond, or money order who has paid money to the administrator pursuant to this chapter and who subsequently makes payment to any other person appearing to the holder to be entitled to payment.  Upon filing proof of payment that the payee was entitled thereto, the administrator shall promptly reimburse such holder for such payment without imposing any fee or other charge.
