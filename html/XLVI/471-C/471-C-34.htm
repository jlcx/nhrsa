&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 471-C:34 Requests for Reports and Examination of Records. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The administrator may require any person who has not filed a report to file a verified report stating whether or not the person is holding any unclaimed property reportable or deliverable under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The administrator, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, may examine the records of any person to determine whether the person has complied with the provisions of this chapter.  The administrator may conduct the examination even if the person believes it is not in possession of any property reportable or deliverable under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a person is treated under RSA 471-C:12 as the holder of the property only insofar as the interest of the business association in the property is concerned, the administrator, pursuant to paragraph II, may examine the records of the person if the administrator has given the notice required by paragraph II to both the person and the business association at least 90 days before the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If an examination of the records of a person results in the disclosure of property reportable and deliverable under this chapter, the administrator may assess the cost of the examination against the holder at the current rate established in RSA 383:11 for each examiner, but in no case may the charges exceed the value of the property found to be reportable and deliverable.  The cost of examination made pursuant to paragraph III may be imposed only against the business association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a holder fails after January 1, 1987 to maintain the records required by RSA 471-C:35 and the records of the holder available for the periods subject to this chapter are insufficient to permit the preparation of a report, the administrator may require the holder to report and pay such amounts as may reasonably be estimated from any available records.
