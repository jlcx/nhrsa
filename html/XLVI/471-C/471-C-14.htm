&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 471-C:14 Property Held in State Agency Storage Rooms.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, all noncontraband abandoned or lost property having a value of less than $250 which has been held in a state agency storage room for a period of at least 60 days may be disposed of by the state agency after the agency has made a good faith effort to return the property to the owner, if known.  If the owner cannot be determined or the property cannot be returned for any other reason, the property shall be transferred to the department of administrative services, division of procurement and support services to be sold at public auction with the proceeds to be turned over to the state treasurer.  The state shall be free of all liability for any claim thereafter arising or made with respect to property disposed of under this section.
