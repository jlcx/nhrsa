<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the payment or delivery of property to the administrator, the state assumes custody and responsibility for the safekeeping of the property.

If reimbursement is sought for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a travelers check or money order, the holder shall be reimbursed under this paragraph upon filing proof that the instrument was duly presented and that payment was made to a person who appeared to the holder to be entitled to payment.  The holder shall be reimbursed for payment made under this paragraph even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was barred under RSA 471-C:33, I.

IV. The administrator may accept the holder's affidavit as sufficient proof of the facts that entitle the holder to recover money and property under this section.
<br>

V.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For the purposes of this section, "good faith'' means that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Payment or delivery was made in a reasonable attempt to comply with this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The person delivering the property was not a fiduciary then in breach of trust in respect to the property and had a reasonable basis for believing, based on the facts then known to the person, that the property was abandoned for the purposes of this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) There is no showing that the records pursuant to which the delivery was made did not meet reasonable commercial standards of practice in the industry.

VII. Property removed from a safe deposit or other safekeeping repository is received by the administrator subject to the holder's right under this paragraph to be reimbursed for the actual cost of the opening and to any valid lien or contract providing for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent or storage charges.

The administrator may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if in the judgment of the administrator the bid is insufficient.  If in the judgment of the administrator the probable cost of sale exceeds the value of the property it need not be offered for sale.  Any sale held under this section shall be preceded by notice sent via regular mail to the last known address of the property owner at least 30 days in advance of sale and a single publication of notice, at least 3 weeks in advance of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is to be sold.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Securities listed on an established stock exchange shall be sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale on the exchange.  Other securities may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any other method the administrator considers advisable.

III. Unless the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, all securities, other than those presumed abandoned under RSA 471-C:10, delivered to the administrator shall be held for at least one year before the administrator may sell them.  Sales of securities shall be preceded by regular mail notice as set forth in paragraph I.

IV. Unless the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, all securities presumed abandoned under RSA 471-C:10 and delivered to the administrator shall be held for at least one year before the administrator may sell them.  If the administrator sells any securities delivered pursuant to RSA 471-C:10 before the expiration of the one-year period, any person making a claim pursuant to this chapter before the end of the one-year period is entitled to either the proceeds of the sale of the securities or the market value of the securities at the time the claim is made, whichever amount is greater, less any deduction for fees pursuant to RSA 471-C:25, II.  A person making a claim under this chapter after the expiration of this period is entitled to receive either the securities delivered to the administrator by the holder, if they still remain in the hands of the administrator, or the proceeds received from sale, less any amount deducted pursuant to RSA 471-C:25, II, but no person has any claim under this chapter against the state, the holder, any transfer agent, registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder for any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the administrator.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) A person, excluding another state, claiming an interest in any property paid or delivered to the administrator may file with the administrator a claim on a form prescribed by the administrator and verified by the claimant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person claiming an abandoned utility deposit or any other abandoned property under the provisions of RSA 471-C:8 that was not deposited with the administrator pursuant to RSA 471-C:8, II or IV, may file a claim on a form prescribed by the administrator and verified by the claimant.  Any claim paid by the administrator under this paragraph, shall be reimbursable by the utility company which originally reported the property as abandoned or the public interest payphone fund established under RSA 374:22-q.  The utility company or the public interest payphone fund shall remit such payment upon notification of the claim by the administrator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the administrator holds unclaimed property in the name of a deceased owner, the administrator may consider claims to the property as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In the case of an open estate, by the administrator or executor appointed by the probate court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Except as provided in subparagraphs (5)-(7), in the case of a closed estate where the unclaimed property is valued at less than $5,000 and does not include securities in share form, in accordance with the final distribution of assets as approved by the probate court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Except as provided in subparagraphs (5)-(7), in the absence of an open estate or probate court decree of final distribution, and the unclaimed property is valued at less than $5,000 and does not include securities in share form, by the surviving spouse of the deceased owner, or, if there is no surviving spouse, then to the next of kin in accordance with the provisions of RSA 561:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In all other instances where the administrator holds property in the name of a deceased owner, a probate estate shall be opened, in an appropriate jurisdiction by the claimant, or other interested party, in order to determine the appropriate distribution of the unclaimed property under the law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Before distributing any unclaimed property pursuant to subparagraphs (2) and (3), the administrator shall first ensure that the department of health and human services does not have a claim for medical and or financial assistance paid on behalf of the deceased owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) In the event that the department of health and human services has a claim for medical and or financial assistance paid on behalf of the deceased owner, the department may submit a claim for such assistance using an affidavit developed by the administrator that ensures that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) No individual has moved to probate the deceased owner's estate through which the department could assert its claim or probate administration for the deceased owner had been open and no individual has moved to reopen the estate through which the department could assert its claim;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The department does not believe, based on the information available to it, there are known expenses for the deceased owner's necessary funeral and burial;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Based on all facts known to the department, its recovery of this abandoned property is not limited by the prohibitions to recovery as set forth in 42 U.S.C. section 1396p and RSA 167:16-a, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) If the department of health and human services has made a claim against a deceased owner's unclaimed property as provided in subparagraph (6), under no circumstances shall the administrator distribute to the department more than the claimed amount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The administrator shall consider each claim within 90 days after it is filed and give written notice to the claimant if the claim is denied in whole or in part.  The notice may be given by mailing it to the last address, if any, stated in the claim as the address to which notices are to be sent.  If no address for notices is stated in the claim, the notice may be mailed to the last address, if any, of the claimant as stated in the claim.  No notice of denial need be given if the claim fails to state either the last address to which notices are to be sent or the address of the claimant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a claim is allowed, the administrator shall pay over or deliver to the claimant the property or the amount the administrator actually received or the net proceeds if it has been sold by the administrator, together with any additional amount required by RSA 471-C:23.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 471-C:27 Claim of Another State to Recover Property;  Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At any time after property has been paid or delivered to the administrator under this chapter, another state may recover the property if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The property was subjected to custody by this state because the records of the holder did not reflect the last known address of the apparent owner when the property was presumed abandoned under this chapter, and the other state establishes that the last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property was in that state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property, as reflected by the records of the holder, is in the other state and under the laws of the state the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The records of the holder were erroneous in that they did not accurately reflect the actual owner of the property and the last known address of the actual owner is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The property was subjected to custody by this state under RSA 471-C:3, VI and under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The property is the sum payable on a travelers check, money order, or other similar instrument that was subjected to custody by this state under RSA 471-C:4, and that instrument was purchased in the other state, and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or became subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The claim of another state to recover escheated or abandoned property must be presented in a form prescribed by the administrator, who shall decide the claim within 90 days after it is presented.  The administrator shall allow the claim if the administrator determines that the other state is entitled to the abandoned property under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The administrator shall require a state, before recovering property under this section, to agree to indemnify this state and its officers and employees against any liability on a claim for the property.

I. Within 36 months after the close of the state's fiscal year in which any property presumed abandoned under this chapter is paid or delivered to the administrator, if no claim for the property has been made and established by any person, not including another state, entitled to the property and notice pursuant to RSA 471-C:20 has occurred, the administrator shall pay or deliver all such property to the appropriate county treasurer as required under RSA 471-C:31, subject to the state deduction under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before the administrator pays or delivers the property to the general fund or the appropriate county treasurer as required under paragraph I and RSA 471-C:31, the administrator shall retain 15 percent of the amount to be returned as a deduction for any costs and service charges which the state shall incur in escheat proceedings or with respect to reimbursements made pursuant to paragraph III.  The administrator shall deposit this sum in the general fund.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the expiration of any period of time specified by law, during which an action or proceeding may be commenced or enforced to obtain payment of a claim for money or recovery of property, shall not serve as a defense in any action or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the administrator against any federal, state or local government or governmental subdivision, agency, entity, officer or appointee for the payment or delivery of any abandoned property to the administrator pursuant to this chapter or to enforce or collect any penalty provided by this chapter.

II. The administrator, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, may examine the records of any person to determine whether the person has complied with the provisions of this chapter.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a person is treated under RSA 471-C:12 as the holder of the property only insofar as the interest of the business association in the property is concerned, the administrator, pursuant to paragraph II, may examine the records of the person if the administrator has given the notice required by paragraph II to both the person and the business association at least 90 days before the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If an examination of the records of a person results in the disclosure of property reportable and deliverable under this chapter, the administrator may assess the cost of the examination against the holder at the current rate established in RSA 383:11 for each examiner, but in no case may the charges exceed the value of the property found to be reportable and deliverable.  The cost of examination made pursuant to paragraph III may be imposed only against the business association.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 471-C:44 Unclaimed United States Savings Bonds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "United States savings bond'' means property, tangible or intangible, in the form of a savings bond issued by the United States treasury whether in paper form, electronic, or paperless form, along with all proceeds thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, United States savings bonds held or owing in this state by any person, or issued or owed in the course of a holder's business, or by a state or other government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, and all proceeds thereof, shall be presumed abandoned and unclaimed in this state if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The last known address of the owner of the United States savings bond is in New Hampshire;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The United States savings bond has remained unclaimed and unredeemed for 5 years after final maturity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. United States savings bonds which are presumed abandoned and unclaimed under paragraph II, including bonds in the possession of the administrator, and those lost, stolen, or destroyed bonds registered to persons with last known addresses in the state, shall escheat to the state of New Hampshire one year after such bonds are presumed abandoned, and all property rights and legal title to and ownership of the United States savings bonds or proceeds from the bonds, including all rights, powers, and privileges of survivorship of any owner, co-owner, or beneficiary, shall vest solely in the state of New Hampshire according to the procedure set forth in paragraphs IV and IX.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 180 days after the one year prescribed in paragraph III, if no claim has been filed with the administrator for such United States savings bonds, the administrator may commence a civil action in the Merrimack County superior court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, for a determination that such United States savings bonds shall escheat to the state of New Hampshire.  The administrator may postpone the bringing of such action until sufficient United States savings bonds have accumulated in the administrator's custody to justify the expense of such proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The administrator shall make service by publication of the civil action in accordance with RSA 471-C:20.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Before service by publication as required by paragraph V of this section can be made, the administrator shall file with the court an affidavit or a declaration stating all of the following facts that apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The residences of all named persons sought to be served, if known, and the names of all persons whose residences are unknown after reasonable effort to ascertain them and the specific efforts made to ascertain their residences.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The affiant or declarant has made a reasonable but unsuccessful effort to ascertain the names and residences of any person or persons sought to be served as unknown parties and the specific efforts made to ascertain the names and residences.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The affiant or declarant seeking service by publication is unable to obtain service of summons on the person or persons in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The affiant or declarant seeking service by publication sent notice by certified mail to the last known address in New Hampshire of the person or persons of their ability to make a claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If no person files a claim with the administrator or appears at the court hearing to substantiate a claim or where the court determines that a claimant is not entitled to the property claimed by such claimant, then the court, if satisfied by evidence that the administrator has substantially complied with the laws of the state of New Hampshire, shall enter a judgment that the subject United States savings bonds, registered to persons with last known addresses in the state, have escheated to the state of New Hampshire, and all property rights and legal title to and ownership of such United States savings bonds or proceeds from such bonds, including all rights, powers, and privileges of survivorship of any owner, co-owner or beneficiary, shall vest in the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The administrator shall redeem such United States savings bonds escheated to the state of New Hampshire and when the proceeds which have escheated have been recovered by the administrator, it shall first pay all costs incident to the collection and recovery of such proceeds from the redemption of the United States savings bonds and shall thereafter promptly deposit the remaining balance of such proceeds to the state general fund, to be distributed in accordance with law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Any person making a claim for the United States savings bonds which have escheated to the state of New Hampshire under this section, or for the proceeds from such bonds which have escheated to the state of New Hampshire, may file a claim with the administrator.  Upon providing sufficient proof of the validity of such person's claim, the administrator may pay such claim less any expenses and costs, not to exceed 10 percent of the bond's proceeds, which shall have been incurred by the state in securing full title and ownership of such property by escheat.  If payment has been made to any claimant, no action thereafter shall be maintained by any other claimant against the state or any officer thereof, for or on account of such funds.
