&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided by this section, the administrator shall promptly deposit in the general fund of this state all funds received under this chapter, including the proceeds from the sale of abandoned property under RSA 471-C:24;  provided, however, that in the case of funds which originated from the highway fund or fish and game fund, any such funds received under this chapter shall be deposited in the fund from which they originated.  The administrator shall retain in a separate fund an amount sufficient to make prompt payment of claims duly allowed.  Before making the deposit, the administrator shall record the name and last known address of each person appearing from the holders' reports to be entitled to the property and the name and last known address of each insured person or annuitant and beneficiary and, with respect to each policy or contract listed in the report of an insurance company, its number and the name of the company.  The record must be available for public inspection at all reasonable business hours.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before making any deposit to the credit of the general fund or county treasurer as provided in paragraph I, the administrator may deduct any costs incurred in connection with the administration of this chapter;  provided, however, that costs incurred in the effectuation of RSA 471-C:30 shall be allowed as set forth in RSA 471-C:30, II.
