&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 471-C:39 Agreement to Locate, Deliver, or Recover Reported Property. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All agreements to pay compensation to locate, deliver, recover, or assist in the recovery of property reported under RSA 471-C:19, made within 24 months after the date payment or delivery is made under RSA 471-C:21, are unenforceable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An agreement to pay compensation to recover or assist in the recovery of unclaimed property shall be valid only if the agreement is in writing and signed by the apparent owner, sets forth the nature and value of the property and the value of the apparent owner's share after the fee or compensation has been deducted, and contains the following disclosure:  "Each state maintains an office of abandoned property.  Generally, if for a number of years an owner of property has not communicated in writing directly with the holder of the property and has not otherwise indicated an interest in the property, the property may be transferred to the office of abandoned property which will act as custodian of the property for the owner.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an owner from asserting at any time that an agreement to locate property is based upon an excessive or unjust consideration.
