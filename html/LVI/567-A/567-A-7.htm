&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 567-A:7 Effect of Appeal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
After an appeal has been filed in the supreme court, all proceedings in pursuance of the decision appealed from shall be stayed pending determination of the appeal by the supreme court.  The probate judge may, if the interests of an estate require it, appoint a special administrator under RSA 553:20.  A decision of a probate judge, so far as it is affirmed or unaltered by the supreme court on appeal, shall be considered to have been in force from the time it was made by the probate judge.
