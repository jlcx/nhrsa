<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If property is or has been given in trust to be applied to a charitable purpose, and said purpose or its application is or becomes impossible or impracticable or illegal or obsolete or ineffective or prejudicial to the public interest to carry out, the trust shall not fail.  Upon petition by the trustee or trustees or the attorney general, the probate court may direct the application of the property to some charitable purpose which is useful to the community, and which charitable purpose fulfills as nearly as possible the general charitable intent of the settlor or testator.  In applying the doctrine of cy pres, the court may order the distribution of the trust assets to another charitable trustor to a charitable corporation to be held and administered by it in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument as said terms may be modified by the application of cy pres under this section and RSA 547:3-e.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Modifying or enlarging the powers granted the trustee, or declaring that a trustee does not have certain powers under New Hampshire law to the extent necessary in order to bring the terms of the governing instrument into compliance with the tax exemption requirements of federal law.

II. Authorizing the trustee to make charitable distributions from principal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

If the probate court, upon application by the trustee or trustees, finds that the continuance of a charitable trust is impracticable or unfeasible, and that the charitable purpose of the settlor or testator can be accomplished by a transfer of the trust assets to another charitable trust or corporation, or to the beneficiaries of said trust, the trust is subject to termination by the court upon such terms and conditions as it may impose.

<codesect>
In cases where a right to jury trial is guaranteed by the constitution or granted by statute, a plaintiff desiring a jury trial shall file the action in the superior court, and filing the action in the probate court where there is concurrent jurisdiction shall constitute a waiver of a jury trial by the plaintiff.  If the defendant desires a jury trial, the defendant shall indicate the request for a jury trial at the time of the defendant's initial pleading with the court.  Failure to timely request a jury trial shall constitute a waiver by the defendant thereof.  If a jury trial is requested by the defendant, the matter shall be transferred to the superior court.

The governor and council upon retirement of any such judge of probate as provided herein shall appoint a successor to serve out the remainder of the term.  Any judge of probate who has served in such capacity for a period of at least ten years in said office, retired from regular active service because of permanent disability, shall receive during the remainder of his term a salary equal to one-half the salary being paid to him at the time of his retirement, except in case of his election to take other retirement benefits as hereinafter provided.  Any judge retired from active regular service under the provisions hereof who is also a member of the state employees' retirement system or the New Hampshire retirement system shall be entitled to retire with disability benefits under either of said systems, upon notification to the retirement board.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Appointment in Contested Cases.  A probate judge may appoint as a master in any contested case such former judge of the probate court as has retired therefrom by age limitation when to do so will expedite the business of the court.  If a probate judge is unable for any cause to sit in any case, a member of the Bar of New Hampshire who is a disinterested justice of the peace, or a disinterested justice or special justice from a district court, attending upon written request of the sitting judge and approval of the administrative judge of the probate court, may hear as master and make recommendations as to the disposition of the case.  Said appointed special master shall keep a record of the case, which shall be kept with and constitute a part of the records of said court, all of which shall be approved by the judge of said court before the order is issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Compensation.  Such master or special master when sitting as master shall be allowed per diem compensation determined by the supreme court upon recommendation by the judicial branch administrative council, established pursuant to supreme court rule, plus reasonable expenses.  If the parties are indigent, the probate court, in its discretion, may assess such charges against the state;  provided, however, that all bills submitted by the master for compensation shall first be submitted to the probate judge for approval.
