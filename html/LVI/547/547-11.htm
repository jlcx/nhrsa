<codesect>
The judge shall have power to enforce all orders and decrees made by him in the exercise of any authority or jurisdiction conferred upon him, and to punish contempts of his authority, as the superior court has in like cases.  Whenever it appears necessary to preserve or protect the assets of any estate, the judge, on application or upon his own motion, may impound the books, records and assets of any fiduciary or may enjoin the withdrawal of any moneys or deposits or transfers of any securities by any fiduciary, or may direct the temporary investment of the assets of any estate in securities approved by the judge or require them to be deposited in any bank or institution authorized to receive deposits.
