<codesect>
If the judge disqualifies himself, by reason of a conflict of interest or otherwise, to sit in any case, he shall cause a record of the disqualification to be made and shall adjourn the case to another time and place.  Upon the assignment of the administrative judge of the probate court, a full-time judge or, if he is unavailable, another judge shall have the power to make any decree or order which could have been made by the judge before whom the case was originally entered, had he not disqualified himself.
