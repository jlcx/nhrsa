<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To any person to whom the transferor is indebted on account of an antenuptial agreement or an agreement or order of court for the payment of support or alimony in favor of such transferor's spouse, former spouse, or children, or for a division or distribution of property in favor of such transferor's spouse or former spouse, but only to the extent of such debt;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To any person who suffers death, personal injury, or property damage on or before the date of a qualified disposition by a transferor, which death, personal injury, or property damage is at any time determined to have been caused in whole or in part by the act or omission of either such transferor or by another person for whom such transferor is or was vicariously liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Paragraph I shall not apply to any claim for forced heirship or legitime or the elective share of the transferor's surviving spouse, unless the transferor made the qualified disposition for the purpose of defeating the surviving spouse's elective share rights.
