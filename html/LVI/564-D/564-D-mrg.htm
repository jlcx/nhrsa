<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A disposition by a trustee who is not a qualified trustee to a qualified trustee will not fail to qualify a qualified disposition solely because the trust instrument fails to meet the requirements of subparagraph I(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A spendthrift provision within the meaning of RSA 564-B:1-103(17) is a restriction on the transfer of the transferor's beneficial interest in the trust that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. section 541(c)(2).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-D:3 Qualified Trustee Defined. &#150;</b>
<codesect>

<codesect>
Neither the transferor nor any other natural person who is a nonresident of this state nor an entity that is not authorized by the law of this state to act as a trustee or whose activities are not subject to supervision as provided in RSA 564-D:3 may be considered a qualified trustee.  However, nothing in this chapter precludes a transferor from appointing one or more trust advisors (whether or not such trust advisors would meet the requirements imposed by RSA 564-D:3), including, but not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Trust advisors who have authority under the terms of the trust instrument to remove and appoint qualified trustees or trust advisors;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Trust advisors who have authority under the terms of the trust instrument to direct, consent to, or disapprove distribution from the trust.  For purposes of this section, the term trust advisor includes a trust advisor as described in RSA 564-B:1-103(27), a trust protector as described in RSA 564-B:1-103(28), or any other person who, in addition to a qualified trustee, holds one or more trust powers.

If a transferor serves as a trust advisor or trust protector, then the transferor may have any right or power, except any right or power that, under RSA 564-D:2, would cause the trust to be revocable.

<center><h3>Section 564-D:16</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-D:16 Avoidance of Qualified Disposition. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A qualified disposition is avoided only to the extent necessary to satisfy the transferor's debt to the creditor at whose instance the disposition had been avoided, together with such costs, including attorney's fees, as the court may allow.  If any qualified disposition is avoided as provided in this section, then:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the court is satisfied that a qualified trustee has not acted in bad faith in accepting or administering the property that is the subject of the qualified disposition:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such qualified trustee has a first and paramount lien against the property that is the subject of the qualified disposition in an amount equal to the entire cost, including attorney's fees, properly incurred by such qualified trustee in the defense of the action or proceedings to avoid the qualified disposition.  It is presumed that such qualified trustee did not act in bad faith merely by accepting such property;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The qualified disposition is avoided subject to the proper fees, costs, preexisting rights, claims, and interests of such qualified trustee, and of any predecessor qualified trustee that has not acted in bad faith;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the court is satisfied that a beneficiary of a trust has not acted in bad faith, the avoidance of the qualified disposition is subject to the right of such beneficiary to retain any distribution made upon the exercise of a trust power or discretion vested in the qualified trustee or qualified trustees of such trust, which power or discretion was properly exercised prior to the creditor's commencement of an action to avoid the qualified disposition.  It is presumed that the beneficiary, including a beneficiary who is also a transferor of the trust, did not act in bad faith merely by creating the trust or by accepting a distribution made in accordance with the terms of the trust.
