<codesect>
If a qualified trustee of a trust ceases to meet the requirements of RSA 564-D:3, and there remains no trustee that meets such requirements, such formerly qualified trustee shall be deemed to have resigned as of the time of such cessation, and thereupon the successor qualified trustee provided for in the trust instrument shall become a qualified trustee of the trust, effective upon such successor qualified trustee's acceptance of the office of trustee, or, if such named successor qualified trustee is unable or unwilling to accept such office, or if the trust instrument does not provide for any successor qualified trustee, the probate court shall, upon application of any interested party, appoint a successor qualified trustee.
