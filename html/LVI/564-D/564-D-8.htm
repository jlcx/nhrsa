&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-D:8 Transferor's Powers and Rights. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A qualified disposition is subject to RSA 564-D:9 to RSA 564-D:14, inclusive, notwithstanding a transferor's retention of any or all of the powers and rights described in RSA 564-D:2, II or the transferor's service as trust advisor pursuant to RSA 564-D:5.
