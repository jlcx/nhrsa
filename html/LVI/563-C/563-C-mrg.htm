<center><h3>Section 563-C:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 563-C:8 Ownership on Death of Owner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
On a death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners.  On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners.  Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common.  If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

<center><h3>Section 563-C:9</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 563-C:9 Protection of Registering Entity. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form.  If a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to the registering entity by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. By accepting a request for registration of a security in beneficiary form, the registering entity agrees that the registration will be implemented on death of the deceased owner as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs, or devisees of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with RSA 563-C:8 and does so in good faith reliance:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) On the registration;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) On this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) On information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary's representatives, or other information available to the registering entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The protections of this chapter do not extend to a registration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from any claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form.  No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under this chapter.  The protection provided by this chapter to the registering entity of a security does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its value or proceeds.

<center><h3>Section 563-C:11</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 563-C:11 Terms, Conditions, and Forms for Registration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests (i) for registrations in beneficiary form, and (ii) for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary.  The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death.  Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for "lineal descendants per stirpes''.  This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate.  Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The following are illustrations of registrations in beneficiary form which a registering entity may authorize:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Sole owner-sole beneficiary:  John S Brown TOD (or POD) John S Brown Jr.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Multiple owner-sole beneficiary:  John S Brown Mary B Brown JT TEN TOD John S Brown Jr.
<br>
