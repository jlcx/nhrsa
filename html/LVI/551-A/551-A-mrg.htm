&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 551-A:3 International Will;  Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The will shall be made in writing.  It need not be written by a testator.  It may be written in any language, by hand or by any other means.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The testator shall declare in the presence of 2 witnesses and of a person authorized to act in connection with international wills that the document is the testator's will and that the testator knows the contents thereof.  The testator need not inform the witnesses, or the authorized person, of the contents of the will.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the presence of the witnesses, and of the authorized person, the testator shall sign the will or, if the testator has previously signed it, shall acknowledge his or her signature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the testator is unable to sign, the absence of his or her signature does not affect the validity of the international will if the testator indicates the reason for his or her inability to sign and the authorized person makes note thereof on the will.  In these cases, it is permissible for any other person present, including the authorized person or one of the witnesses, at the direction of the testator to sign the testator's name for the testator, if the authorized person makes note of this also on the will, but it is not required that any person sign the testator's name.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The witnesses and the authorized person shall there and then attest the will by signing in the presence of the testator.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The date of the will shall be the date of its signature by the authorized person.  That date shall be noted at the end of the will by the authorized person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The authorized person shall ask the testator whether he or she wishes to make a declaration concerning the safekeeping of the testator's will.  If so and at the express request of the testator the place where he or she intends to have his or her will kept shall be mentioned in the certificate provided for in RSA 551-A:5.
