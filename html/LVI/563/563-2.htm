&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 563:2 Requirement of Survival by 120 Hours. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Except as provided in RSA 563:6, if the title to property, the devolution of property, the right to elect an interest in property, or the right to exempt property, homestead, or family allowance depends upon an individual's survivorship of the death of another individual, an individual who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived the other individual by 120 hours is deemed to have predeceased the other individual.  This section shall not apply if its application would result in a taking of an intestate estate by the state.
