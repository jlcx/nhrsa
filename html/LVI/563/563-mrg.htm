<center><h3>Section 563:5</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 563:5 Evidence of Death or Status. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In addition to otherwise applicable rules of evidence, the following rules relating to a determination of death and status apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Death occurs when an individual is determined to be dead under RSA 141-D:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate purporting to be issued by a governmental official or agency of the place where the death purportedly occurred is prima facie evidence of the fact, place, date, and time of death and of the identity of the decedent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A certified or authenticated copy of any record or report of a governmental official or agency, domestic or foreign, that an individual is missing, detained, dead, or alive is prima facie evidence of the status and of the dates, times, identities, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the absence of prima facie evidence of death under paragraph II or III, the fact of death may be established by clear and convincing evidence, including circumstantial evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An individual whose death is not established under the preceding paragraphs who is absent for a continuous period of 4 years, during which time that individual has not been heard from, and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search or inquiry, is presumed to be dead.  The individual's death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In the absence of evidence disputing the time of death stated on a document described in paragraph II or III, a document described in paragraph II or III that states a time of death 120 hours or more after the time of death of another individual, however the time of death of the other individual is determined, establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the other individual by 120 hours.

<center><h3>Section 563:6</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 563:6 Exceptions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Survival by 120 hours is not required if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governing instrument contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common disaster and that language is operable under the facts of the case;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The governing instrument expressly indicates that an individual is not required to survive an event, including the death of another individual, by any specific period or expressly requires the individual to survive the event for a specified period;  but survival of the event or the specified period shall be established by clear and convincing evidence;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The imposition of a 120-hour requirement of survival would cause a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment to be invalid under the Rule Against Perpetuities;  but survival shall be established by clear and convincing evidence;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The application of a 120-hour requirement of survival to multiple governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition;  but survival shall be established by clear and convincing evidence.

<center><h3>Section 563:7</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 563:7 Protection of Payors, Bona Fide Purchasers, and Other Third Parties;  Personal Liability of Recipient. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a person designated in a governing instrument who, under this chapter, is not entitled to the payment or item of property, or for having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the person's apparent entitlement under the terms of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this chapter.  A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under paragraph I shall be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by first class mail, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as notice in an action.  Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this chapter, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of proceedings relating to decedents' estates located in the county of the decedent's residence.  The court shall hold the funds or item of property and, upon its determination under this chapter, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination.  Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who receives a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation, is neither obligated under this chapter to return the payment, item of property, or benefit nor liable under this chapter for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit.  But a person who, not for value, receives a payment, item of property, or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this chapter is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If this chapter or any part of this chapter is preempted by federal law with respect to a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit covered by this chapter, a person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of property, or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this chapter is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would have been entitled to it were this chapter or part of this chapter not preempted.
