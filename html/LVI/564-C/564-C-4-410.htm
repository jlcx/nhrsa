(a) In this section, "liquidating asset'' means an asset whose value will diminish or terminate because the asset is expected to produce receipts for a period of limited duration.  The term includes a leasehold, patent, copyright, royalty right, and right to receive payments under an arrangement that does not provide for the payment of interest on the unpaid balance.  The term does not include a payment subject to RSA 564-C:4-409, resources subject to RSA 564-C:4-411, timber subject to RSA 564-C:4-412, an activity subject to RSA 564-C:4-414, an asset subject to RSA 564-C:4-415, or any asset for which the trustee establishes a reserve for depreciation under RSA 564-C:5-503.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A trustee shall allocate to income 10 percent of the receipts from a liquidating asset and the balance to principal.
