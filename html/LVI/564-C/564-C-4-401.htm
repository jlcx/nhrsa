(a) In this section, "entity'' means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund, or any other organization in which a trustee has an interest other than a trust or estate to which RSA 564-C:4-402 applies, a business or activity to which RSA 564-C:4-403 applies, or an asset-backed security to which RSA 564-C:4-415 applies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a trustee shall allocate to income money received from an entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A trustee shall allocate the following receipts from an entity to principal:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) property other than money;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) money received in one distribution or a series of related distributions in exchange for part or all of a trust's interest in the entity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) money received in total or partial liquidation of the entity;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) money received from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust if the money distributed is a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) money is received in partial liquidation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) to the extent that the entity, at or near the time of a distribution, indicates that it is a distribution in partial liquidation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) if the total amount of money and property received in a distribution or series of related distributions is greater than 20 percent of the entity's gross assets, as shown by the entity's year end financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
