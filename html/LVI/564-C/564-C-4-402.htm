&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-C:4-402 Distribution From Trust or Estate. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A trustee shall allocate to income an amount received as a distribution of income from a trust or an estate in which the trust has an interest other than a purchased interest, and shall allocate to principal an amount received as a distribution of principal from such a trust or estate.  If a trustee purchases an interest in a trust that is an investment entity, or a decedent or donor transfers an interest in such a trust to a trustee, RSA 564 C:4-401 or RSA 564-C:4-415 applies to a receipt from the trust.
