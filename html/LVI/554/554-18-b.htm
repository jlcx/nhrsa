&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 554:18-b Waiver of Rights to Devised or Inherited Real Property.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any right to disclaim an interest in property as provided for in RSA 563-B, a person who has been devised real estate by testamentary instrument, or inherited under the laws of intestacy, may waive his or her rights to the property by filing a written notice of waiver with the court in which the estate administration is pending that shall include a legal description of the property.  The waiving party shall provide a copy of the waiver to the administrator of the estate and shall record an attested copy in the registry of deeds in the county in which the real estate is located.  Once filed with the court and recorded at the registry of deeds, the waiver may not be revoked.  The effect of the waiver will be to relinquish the right of the waiving party and his or her heirs and assigns from receiving any and all right, title, and interest in and to the real estate.  The waiving party and his or her heirs and assigns shall thereafter bear no responsibility or liability related to or arising from the real estate.  The cost to record the waiver in the registry of deeds shall not exceed $5.  A waiver filed after the final account has been allowed, or the estate administration has been closed by other means, shall not be effective.
