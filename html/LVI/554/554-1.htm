<codesect>
Every administrator shall file under oath, with the court, within 90 days after the date of appointment, a full, true, and itemized inventory of all the estate of the deceased which has come to the administrator's knowledge.  If an administrator fails to file an inventory within 30 days after the required filing date, the administrator is in default.  The clerk shall give notice of the default to the administrator by first class mail within 10 days after the default.  The clerk shall issue a citation notice in accordance with RSA 554:26-a.  The inventory shall contain a description of the real estate;  a correct schedule of all goods, chattels, stocks, bonds, cemetery plots or burial spaces, and other effects of the deceased;  of all notes, with their dates and terms of payment, and the date and amount of each endorsement thereon;  of all deposits in savings banks, with the name and location of each bank, the number of each book, the date of the last dividend, and the whole amount then due thereon less any withdrawals since that date;  and a list and description of any other written evidences of debt.  If any person claims a present legal or equitable right of title to real or personal property in the estate of the deceased, the administrator may petition the probate court pursuant to RSA 547:11-b to determine the question as between the parties.
