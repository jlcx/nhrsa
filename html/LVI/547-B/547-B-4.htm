Except as limited by law or court order, the public guardianship and protection program shall have the same powers and duties as those granted to private guardians or conservators, pursuant to RSA 464-A.  The public guardianship and protection program shall file annual reports with the probate court for each person for whom it is appointed guardian or co-guardian as provided in RSA 547-B:5.  The reports shall be reviewed by the court to insure that the public guardianship and protection program is complying with all requirements of state and federal law, that the ward is receiving appropriate care and services, and that the highest ethical standards are being maintained.
