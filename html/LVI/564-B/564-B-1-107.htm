<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the law of the jurisdiction designated in the terms of the trust unless the designation of that jurisdiction's law is contrary to a strong public policy of the jurisdiction having the most significant relationship to the matter at issue;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in the absence of a controlling designation in the terms of the trust, the law of the jurisdiction having the most significant relationship to the matter at issue.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Without precluding other circumstances under which this state has the most significant relationship to a matter affecting a trust, this state has the most significant relationship to a matter involving a trust's validity, construction, or administration if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) under the terms of the trust, this state's laws govern that matter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
