<codesect>
(a) In addition to the methods of termination prescribed by RSA 564-B:4-411 through RSA 564-B:4-414, a trust terminates to the extent the trust is revoked or expires pursuant to its terms, no purpose of the trust remains to be achieved, or the purposes of the trust have become unlawful, contrary to public policy, or impossible to achieve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A proceeding to approve or disapprove a proposed modification or termination under RSA 564-B:4-411 through RSA 564-B:4-416, or trust combination or division under RSA 564-B:4-417, may be commenced by a trustee or beneficiary.  The settlor of a charitable trust may maintain a proceeding to modify the trust under RSA 564-B:4-413, and in such proceeding, the director of charitable trusts shall be joined as a necessary party.
