(h) In fulfilling the duty under this section to the director of charitable trusts pursuant to RSA 564-B:1-110(c), the trustee may permit the director of charitable trusts to view the trust instrument and reports upon request at the office of the trustee instead of providing a copy of the trust instrument and the reports.
