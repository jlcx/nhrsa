If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.  This subparagraph shall not apply to:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) a charitable remainder annuity trust within the meaning of section 664(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) an irrevocable trust solely because of the existence or exercise of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust, court order, nonjudicial settlement agreement, or any other provision of law (or the existence or exercise of a discretionary power granted to a trust advisor or trust protector by the terms of the trust, court order, nonjudicial settlement agreement, or any other provision of law, to direct the trustee) to pay directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor's right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the property of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors, costs of administration of the settlor's estate, the expenses of the settlor's funeral and disposal of remains to the extent the settlor's probate estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims, costs, and expenses.  This section does not apply to the proceeds and any other benefits of a policy of life or endowment insurance effected by the settlor on the settlor's own life or on another life as provided in RSA 408:2.
<br>
