&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-B:5-505 Creditor's Claim Against Settlor. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit.  If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.  This subparagraph shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) an irrevocable "special needs trust'' established for a disabled person as described in 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4) or similar federal law governing the transfer to such a trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) an irrevocable trust solely because of the existence or exercise of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust, court order, agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or any other provision of law (or the existence or exercise of a discretionary power granted to a trust advisor or trust protector by the terms of the trust, court order, agreement of the qualified beneficiaries, or any other provision of law, to direct the trustee) to pay directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor's right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the property of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors, costs of administration of the settlor's estate, the expenses of the settlor's funeral and disposal of remains to the extent the settlor's probate estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims, costs, and expenses.  This section does not apply to the proceeds and any other benefits of a policy of life or endowment insurance effected by the settlor on the settlor's own life or on another life as provided in RSA 408:2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) during the period the power may be exercised, the holder of a power of withdrawal is treated in the same manner as the settlor of a revocable trust to the extent of the property subject to the power;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) upon the lapse, release, or waiver of the power, the holder is treated as the settlor of the trust only to the extent the value of the property affected by the lapse, release, or waiver exceeds the greater of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the amount specified in section 2041(b)(2) or 2514(e) of the Internal Revenue Code , or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) the amount specified in section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Nothing in this section shall limit the application of the Qualified Dispositions in Trust Act set forth in RSA 564-D.
