<codesect>
(a) A trustee shall commence a proceeding against a cotrustee or a former trustee for breach of trust within 3 years after the earlier of the date on which the trustee was sent a report that adequately disclosed the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust or the removal, resignation, or death of the cotrustee or former trustee.  A trustee, however, shall not commence a proceeding against a cotrustee or a former trustee if, under RSA 564-B:10-1005, none of the beneficiaries may commence a proceeding against the cotrustee or former trustee for such breach of trust.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A trust advisor or trust protector shall commence a proceeding against a trustee for breach of trust within 3 years after earlier of the date on which the trust advisor or trust protector was sent a report that adequately disclosed the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust or the removal, resignation, or death of the trustee.  A trust advisor or trust protector, however, shall not commence a proceeding against a trustee for breach of trust if, under RSA 564-B:10-1005, none of the beneficiaries may commence a proceeding against the trustee for such breach of trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The periods of limitation under subsection (b) shall not be tolled except by a written agreement of the trust advisors, trust protectors, and trustees or a court order.  Without limiting the circumstances under which a court may issue an order tolling the period of limitations, a court may issue an order tolling the period of limitations under this section during the pendency of any action described in RSA 564-B:10-1014(c)(3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In the case of a claim against a deceased trustee for breach of trust, this section shall apply to the extent that the claim is not barred by a limitation period under RSA 556, RSA 564-B:5-508, or other applicable law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) For purposes of determining whether, for purposes of this section, a trust has terminated or a beneficiary's interest in a trust has terminated, trust property excludes any claim against a trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector.
