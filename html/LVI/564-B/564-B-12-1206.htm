&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-B:12-1206 Limitation of Action Against a Trust Advisor or Trust Protector. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A beneficiary shall commence a proceeding against a trust advisor or trust protector for breach of trust within the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) One year after the date on which the beneficiary or the beneficiary's representative was sent a report that adequately disclosed the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust and informed the beneficiary of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Three years after the date on which the beneficiary or the beneficiary's representative was sent a report that adequately disclosed the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Three years after the trust advisor's or trust protector's resignation or removal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) To the extent that the claim is not barred by a limitation period under RSA 556, RSA 564-B:5-508, or other applicable law, three years after the trust advisor's or trust protector's death;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Three years after termination of the beneficiary's interest in the trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Three years after the termination of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A fiduciary shall commence a proceeding against a trust advisor or trust protector for breach of trust within 3 years after the date on which the fiduciary was sent a report that adequately disclosed the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust;  provided, however, that a fiduciary shall not commence a proceeding against a trust advisor or trust protector for breach of trust if, under subsection (a), none of the beneficiaries may commence a proceeding against the trust advisor or trust protector for such breach of trust.  For purposes of this section, a "fiduciary'' means any trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A report adequately discloses the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust if it provides sufficient information so that the recipient knows of the potential claim or should have inquired into its existence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The periods of limitation under subsection (a) shall not be tolled for any reason, except by a written agreement of the qualified beneficiaries and each of the trust advisors and trust protectors against whom a beneficiary may commence a proceeding or a court order.  The periods of limitation under subsection (b) shall not be tolled for any reason, except by a written agreement of the trustees and each of the trust advisors and trust protectors against whom a fiduciary may commence a proceeding or a court order.  Without limiting the circumstances under which a court may issue an order tolling the period of limitations, a court may issue an order tolling the period of limitations under this section during the pendency of any action described in RSA 564-B:10-1014(c)(3).
