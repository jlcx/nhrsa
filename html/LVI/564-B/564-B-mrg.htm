&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-B:4-406 Validity of Trusts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A trust is void to the extent that it was not validly created in accordance with this chapter or its creation was induced by fraud, duress, or undue influence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person may commence a judicial proceeding to contest the validity of a trust within the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in the case of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death, 3 years after the settlor's death;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in the case of an irrevocable trust, including a formerly revocable trust that has become irrevocable, 3 years after the trustee sent to the beneficiary a notice described in RSA 564-B:8-813(c)(3);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) in the case of an irrevocable trust, including a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death or a formerly revocable trust that has become irrevocable, 180 days after the trustee sent the person a copy of the trust instrument and a notice informing the person of the trust's existence, the trustee's name, address, and telephone number, and the time allowed for commencing a proceeding to contest the validity of a trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A trustee may send the notice described in subsection (b)(3) for purposes of commencing the 180-day limitation period, but the trustee does not have a duty to do so.  A trustee shall not be liable to any person for not sending the notice described in subsection (b)(3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) During his or her life, a settlor may commence a judicial proceeding to determine the validity of a trust that he or she created, subject only to the trust's subsequent amendment or revocation if the trust is revocable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The trust instrument must expressly provide that this state's laws govern the trust's validity, interpretation, and administration, and the trust must have its principal place of administration within this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The venue for the judicial proceeding is in the county where the trust has its principal place of administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In addition to the settlor, each of the following persons is an interested person in the judicial proceeding:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) the settlor's spouse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) the persons who, if the settlor had died on the date of filing the petition, would be the settlor's heirs;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) the qualified beneficiaries;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) the trustees, trust advisors, and trust protectors;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) if the trust is wholly or partially a charitable trust, the director of charitable trusts;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) if the trust is a trust for the care of an animal under RSA 564-B:4-408, the persons who, under the terms of the trust, have the power to enforce the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(G) if the trust is a trust authorized under RSA 564-B:4-409, the persons who, under the terms of the trust, have the power to enforce the trust;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(H) any other persons who would be an interested person in a judicial proceeding to determine the validity of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In the case of a revocable trust, the qualified beneficiaries and other interested persons shall be determined as if the trust was irrevocable on the date of filing the petition, and each of the qualified beneficiaries and other interested persons shall be deemed possessed of inchoate property rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Notice shall be given to each of the interested persons.  The court may order notice be given to other persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) After a hearing, the court shall declare whether the trust is valid or invalid, and it may make other findings of fact and conclusions of law that are appropriate under the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) A trust for which there is a declaration of validity under this subsection may be modified or revoked in the same manner as a trust for which there is no declaration of validity under this subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A settlor's failure to commence a judicial proceeding under this subsection shall not be construed as evidence or as an admission that the trust is invalid for any reason.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust even though the period for contesting the validity of the trust has not expired.  The trustee is not subject to liability for doing so unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the trustee knows of a pending judicial proceeding contesting the validity of the trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a potential contestant has notified the trustee of a possible judicial proceeding to contest the trust and a judicial proceeding is commenced within 60 days after the contestant sent the notification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A beneficiary of a trust that is determined to have been invalid is liable to return any distribution received.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-B:4-418 Trustee's Power to Decant Trust. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Subject to the limitations provided in this section, a trustee has the power to decant a trust.  The power to decant is the power to appoint some or all of the trust property of a trust ("first trust'') to another trust ("second trust'').  A trustee's power to decant is a power with respect to an administrative matter of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The beneficiaries of the second trust may include only one or more of the beneficiaries of the first trust.  The second trust may exclude one or more of the beneficiaries of the first trust.  A person is not a beneficiary of the second trust solely by reason of being a permissible appointee of a power of appointment under the terms of the second trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Under the terms of the second trust, a person may have a power of appointment if (1) that person was a beneficiary of the first trust or (2) under the terms of the first trust, that person held a power of appointment either in a fiduciary or nonfiduciary capacity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the terms of the second trust may provide that a trustee has discretion to distribute income or principal, and the terms of the second trust may impose a standard or no standard on the trustee's discretion regardless of whether the terms of the first trust imposed a standard on the trustee's discretion to distribute income or principal.  If the first trust is a charitable trust and the terms of the first trust impose a standard on the trustee's discretion to distribute income or principal, then the terms of the second trust shall impose the same standard on the trustee's discretion to distribute income or principal, unless the director of charitable trusts expressly consents to the modification or elimination of that standard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The second trust may have a term that is longer than the first trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A trustee may not decant to the extent that the terms of the second trust are inconsistent with a material purpose of the first trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g)(1) A trustee may not decant to the extent that the terms of the second trust reduce or eliminate a vested interest of a beneficiary of the first trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A vested interest is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) a current right to a mandatory distribution of income or principal, a mandatory annuity interest, or a mandatory unitrust interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) a currently-exercisable power of withdrawal;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) a noncontingent, unconditional right to receive an ascertainable portion of the trust property upon the trust's termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In addition to other possible contingencies, a beneficiary's right to receive a portion of the trust property upon the trust's termination is contingent if, by reason of the trustee's discretionary power to make distributions or under other terms of the trust, any person other than the beneficiary or the beneficiary's estate could receive that portion unless the beneficiary survives a specified date or a specified event.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) If a transfer to the first trust qualified for a deduction, credit, exclusion, or exemption for purposes of any income, gift, estate, or generation-skipping transfer tax, then a trustee may decant only to the extent that the decanting would not jeopardize that deduction, credit, exclusion, or exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) If a settlor of the first trust or a beneficiary of the first trust is an applicant for public benefits or receives public benefits and the settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for those public benefits is dependent on the nature and scope of his or her rights, powers, and interests in the first trust, then a trustee may decant only to the extent that the decanting would not jeopardize the settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for those public benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A trustee may not decant to the extent that, under the terms of the second trust:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) one or more beneficiaries can remove the trustee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) those beneficiaries can appoint a successor trustee who, with respect to any of them, is a related or subordinate party within the meaning of section 672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the trustee may distribute trust property to any one or more of those beneficiaries;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the trustee's discretion to make those distributions is not limited by an ascertainable standard.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the trustee's discretion to make or participate in making distributions to himself or herself is exercisable only with the consent of a cotrustee or a person holding an adverse interest, unless the terms of second trust impose the same limitation on that trustee's discretion;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the trustee does not have the discretion to make or participate in making distributions in a manner that will discharge his or her legal support obligations, unless the terms of second trust impose the same limitation on that trustee's discretion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) A trustee is not prohibited from decanting solely because:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the first trust is irrevocable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the terms of the first trust provide that the trust may not be amended or modified;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the first trust contains a spendthrift provision;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) under the terms of the first trust, the trustee does not have any discretion in making distributions of income or principal;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) except as provided in subsection (d), the terms of the first trust impose a standard on the trustee's discretion to distribute income or principal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) A trustee of a charitable trust or a trust in which a charitable organization has a vested interest shall notify the director of charitable trusts of a proposed decanting, and the trustee shall provide that notice in writing at least 30 days before the effective date of the decanting.  A trustee of a noncharitable trust may notify a beneficiary of a proposed decanting, but does not have any duty to do so.  The right of any beneficiary to object to a proposed decanting terminates if the beneficiary does not notify the trustee of an objection within 60 days after the proposal was sent to the beneficiary but only if the proposal informed the beneficiary of the right to object and the time allowed for objection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) A trustee's power to decant may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the terms of the trust.  A nonjudicial settlement agreement made in accordance with RSA 564-B:1-111, however, may only restrict or eliminate a trustee's power to decant.  Except as otherwise provided under the terms of the trust, a trustee's power to decant is in addition to any other powers conferred by the terms of the trust, this chapter, or the laws of this state.  This section does not expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise alter any power that, with respect to a trust, a person holds in a nonfiduciary capacity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(o) A trustee does not have a duty to decant or an ongoing duty to consider whether to decant.  In exercising the power to decant, a trustee has a duty to exercise the power in a manner that is consistent with the settlor's intent as expressed in the terms of the trust, and the trustee shall act in accordance with the trustee's duties under this chapter and the terms of the first trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(p) A trustee may exercise the power to decant, without court approval, the consent of the settlor, or the consent of any of the beneficiaries of the first trust.  A trustee or any other interested person may ask a court to approve a trustee's exercise of the power to decant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-B:4-419 Trustee's Power of Modification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Subject to the limitations provided in this section, a trustee may modify a trust.  A trustee may exercise that power of modification for any reason, including:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) furthering the settlor's intent or a material purpose of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) preserving any favorable tax treatment for the trust, the settlor, or the beneficiaries;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) enhancing the efficient administration of the trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) minimizing the costs of administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A trustee's power under this section is a power with respect to an administrative matter of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A trustee shall not modify a trust to that extent that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the terms of the trust expressly prohibit the trustee's modification of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the modification is inconsistent with the settlor's intent or a material purpose of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the modification expands, restricts, eliminates, or otherwise alters any right or power that the settlor has under this chapter or the terms of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the modification adds a beneficiary, unless the modification is expressly permitted under the terms of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) the modification reduces or eliminates a beneficiary's vested interest in the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) the modification reduces or eliminates a beneficiary's interest in the trust (other than a vested interest), unless the modification is consistent with the settlor's intent as clearly expressed under the terms of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) the modification adds a power of withdrawal or a power of appointment, unless the modification is consistent with the settlor's intent as clearly expressed under the terms of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) the modification reduces or eliminates a currently-exercisable power of appointment held by any person other than a beneficiary, unless the modification is consistent with the settlor's intent as clearly expressed under the terms of the trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) the modification modifies any of the dispositive terms of a charitable trust, unless the director of charitable trusts consents to the modification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the trust or a transfer to the trust qualified for a deduction, credit, exclusion, or exemption for purposes of any income, gift, estate, or other tax, then a trustee may modify a trust only to that extent that the modification would not jeopardize that deduction, credit, exclusion, or exemption.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If a settlor of the trust or a beneficiary of the trust is an applicant for public benefits or receives public benefits and the settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for those public benefits is dependent on the nature and scope of his or her rights, powers, and interests in the trust, then a trustee may modify the trust only to the extent that the modification would not jeopardize the settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for those public benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A trustee does not have the power of modification under this section if the trustee is any of the following persons, either before or after the modification:  (1) the settlor;  (2) a beneficiary of the trust;  (3) a person who, with respect to the settlor or a beneficiary of the trust, is a related or subordinate party within the meaning of section 672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code;  or (4) a trustee whom any one or more of the settlor and the beneficiaries can remove if the persons exercising the removal power can appoint as a successor trustee (i) the settlor, (ii) a beneficiary of the trust, or (iii) a person who, with respect to the settlor or a beneficiary of the trust, is a related or subordinate party within the meaning of section 672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A trustee is not prohibited from exercising the power of modification, and the exercise of that power is not inconsistent with the settlor's intent, solely because:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the trust is irrevocable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the terms of the trust provide that the trust may not be amended by the settlor;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the trust contains a spendthrift provision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A trustee of a charitable trust or a trust in which a charitable organization has a vested interest shall notify the director of charitable trusts of a proposed modification under this section, and the trustee shall provide that notice in writing at least 30 days before the effective date of that modification.  A trustee of a noncharitable trust may notify a beneficiary of a proposed modification under this section, but does not have any duty to do so.  The right of any beneficiary to object to a proposed modification terminates if the beneficiary does not notify the trustee of an objection within 60 days after the proposal was sent to the beneficiary but only if the proposal informed the beneficiary of the right to object and the time allowed for objection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A trustee's power of modification under this section may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the terms of the trust.  A nonjudicial settlement agreement made in accordance with RSA 564-B:1-111, however, may only restrict or eliminate a trustee's power of modification under this section.  Except as otherwise provided under the terms of the trust, a trustee's power of modification under this section is in addition to any other powers conferred by the terms of the trust, this chapter, or the laws of this state.  This section does not expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise alter any power that, with respect to a trust, a person holds in a nonfiduciary capacity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A trustee does not have a duty to modify a trust or an ongoing duty to consider whether to modify a trust.  In exercising the power of modification under this section, a trustee has a duty to exercise the power in a manner that is consistent with the settlor's intent as expressed in the terms of the trust, and the trustee shall act in accordance with the trustee's duties under this chapter and the terms of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) A trustee may exercise the power of modification under this section without court approval, the consent of the settlor, or the consent of any of the beneficiaries of the trust.  A trustee or any other interested person may ask a court to approve a trustee's exercise of the power of modification.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A spendthrift provision is unenforceable against:
<br>

(1) a beneficiary's child for whom there is a judgment or court order against the beneficiary for support;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(a) In this section, "child'' includes any person for whom an order or judgment for child support has been entered in this or another state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), whether or not a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor of a beneficiary may not compel a distribution that is subject to the trustee's discretion, even if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the trustee has abused the discretion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To the extent a trustee has not complied with a standard of distribution or has abused a discretion:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a distribution may be ordered by the court to satisfy a judgment or court order against the beneficiary for support of the beneficiary's child or for alimony for the beneficiary's spouse, or former spouse;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the court shall direct the trustee to pay to the child, spouse, or former spouse such amount as is equitable under the circumstances but not more than the amount the trustee would have been required to distribute to or for the benefit of the beneficiary had the trustee complied with the standard or not abused the discretion and with respect to alimony, only for and to the extent that the judgment or court order expressly specifies the alimony amount attributable to the most basic food, shelter, and medical needs of the spouse or former spouse.

(a) Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit.  If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.  This subparagraph shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) an irrevocable trust solely because of the existence or exercise of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust, court order, nonjudicial settlement agreement, or any other provision of law (or the existence or exercise of a discretionary power granted to a trust advisor or trust protector by the terms of the trust, court order, nonjudicial settlement agreement, or any other provision of law, to direct the trustee) to pay directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor's right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the property of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors, costs of administration of the settlor's estate, the expenses of the settlor's funeral and disposal of remains to the extent the settlor's probate estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims, costs, and expenses.  This section does not apply to the proceeds and any other benefits of a policy of life or endowment insurance effected by the settlor on the settlor's own life or on another life as provided in RSA 408:2.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A settlor's powers with respect to revocation, amendment, or distribution of trust property may be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney only to the extent expressly authorized by the terms of the trust or the power.  Any such revocation or amendment by an agent under a power of attorney shall be effective only if made in a signed record and shall be effective only when sent to the trustee.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Neither the performance nor the failure to perform of a trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust as provided in this subsection shall affect the limitation on the liability of the excluded fiduciary provided by RSA 564-B:12-1206 and RSA 564-B:12-1207.

(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a), if a distribution to or for the benefit of a beneficiary is subject to the exercise of the trustee's discretion, whether or not the terms of a trust include a standard to guide the trustee in making distribution decisions, then the beneficiary's interest is neither a property interest nor an enforceable right, but a mere expectancy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a), unless the terms of the trust expressly provide otherwise, if the terms of a trust permit distributions among a class of beneficiaries, distributions to or for the benefit of whom are subject to the exercise of the trustee's discretion without a standard to guide the trustee in making distribution decisions, then the trustee may make distributions unequally among the beneficiaries and may make distributions entirely to one beneficiary to the exclusion of the other beneficiaries.

(2) a trustee may not exercise a power to make discretionary distributions to satisfy a legal obligation of support that the trustee personally owes another person.

(e) A power whose exercise is limited or prohibited by paragraph (d) may be exercised by a majority of the remaining trustees whose exercise of the power is not so limited or prohibited.  If the power of all trustees is so limited or prohibited, the court may appoint a special trustee with authority to exercise the power.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A trustee shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the investment and management of trust assets.  For purposes of subsections (c)(6) and (c)(7), the trustee has a duty to investigate the relevant information and a duty to monitor the relevant information, and the trustee is not liable to any person to the extent that the trustee performs those duties in good faith and, in accordance with this section, considers the information that the trustee obtains through the good faith performance of those duties.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-B:10-1013 Certification of Trust. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Instead of furnishing a copy of the trust instrument to a person other than a beneficiary, the trustee may furnish to the person a certification of trust containing the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) that the trust exists and the date the trust instrument was executed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the identity of the settlor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the identity and address of the currently acting trustee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) the powers of the trustee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) the revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) the authority of cotrustees to sign or otherwise authenticate and whether all or less than all are required in order to exercise powers of the trustee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) the trust's taxpayer identification number;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) the manner of taking title to trust property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A certification of trust may be signed or otherwise authenticated by any trustee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A certification of trust must state that the trust has not been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A certification of trust need not contain the dispositive terms of a trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A recipient of a certification of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments which designate the trustee and confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification.  Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust or excerpts is liable for damages if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding the trust instrument.
<br>

(i) This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 564-B:10-1014 Enforcement of No-Contest Provision. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) For the purposes of this section, a "no-contest provision'' of a trust instrument means a provision that, if given effect, would reduce or eliminate the interest of any beneficiary of such trust who, directly or indirectly, initiates or otherwise pursues:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any action to contest the validity of the trust or the terms of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any action to set aside or vary the terms of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any action to challenge the acts of the trustee or other fiduciary of the trust in the performance of the trustee's or other fiduciary's duties as described in the terms of the trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Any other act or proceedings to frustrate or defeat the settlor's intent as expressed in the terms of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A no-contest provision shall be enforceable according to the express terms of the no-contest provision without regard to the presence or absence of probable cause for, or the beneficiary's good or bad faith in, taking the action that would justify the complete or partial forfeiture of the beneficiary's interest in the trust under the terms of the no-contest provision.  A no-contest provision shall be unenforceable to the extent that the trust is invalid because of fraud, duress, undue influence, lack of testamentary capacity, or any other reason.  In the case of an action solely to challenge the acts of the trustee or other fiduciary of the trust, a no-contest provision shall be unenforceable to the extent that the trustee or other fiduciary has committed a breach of fiduciary duties or breach of trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subsection (b) shall not apply to the extent that a person initiates, maintains, or cooperates in any of the following actions or proceedings:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any action brought by the trustee or any other fiduciary serving under the terms of the trust, unless the trustee or other fiduciary is a beneficiary against whom the no-contest provision is otherwise enforceable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any agreement among the beneficiaries and any other interested persons in settlement of a dispute or resolution of any other matter relating to the trust, including without limitation any nonjudicial settlement agreement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any action to determine whether a proposed or pending motion, petition, or other proceeding constitutes a contest within the meaning of a no-contest provision;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Any action brought by a beneficiary or on behalf of any such beneficiary for a construction or interpretation of the terms of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Any action brought by the attorney general for a construction or interpretation of a charitable trust or a trust containing a charitable interest if a provision exists in a trust purporting to penalize a charity or charitable interest for contesting the trust if probable cause exists for instituting proceedings;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A proceeding described in subsection (h).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) It is the intent of this section to enforce the settlor's intent as reflected in a no-contest provision to the greatest extent possible.  The provisions of this section shall be construed and applied in a manner consistent with such intent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) This section shall apply to all judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement or interpretation of a no-contest provision commenced on or after its effective date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) In the trustee's discretion, a trustee may suspend distributions to a beneficiary to the extent that, under a no-contest provision, the beneficiary's action potentially would have caused the reduction or elimination of the beneficiary's interest in the trust.  In the trustee's discretion, the trustee may resume those distributions at any time or may continue to suspend those distributions until a court determines whether the beneficiary's interest in the trust has been reduced or eliminated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) In the trustee's discretion, a trustee may decline to distribute trust property in accordance with a person's purported exercise of a power of appointment or a power of withdrawal to the extent that, under a no-contest provision, the person's action potentially would have caused the reduction or elimination of the power of appointment or the power of withdrawal.  In the trustee's discretion, the trustee may make those distributions at any time or may continue to decline to make those distributions until a court determines whether the person's power of appointment or power of withdrawal has been reduced or eliminated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) To the extent that the trustee acts in good faith, the trustee is not liable to any person for exercising the discretion under subsection (f) or (g) or not exercising that discretion.  A trustee shall be presumed to have exercised the discretion in good faith if, in any judicial proceeding, an interested person other than the trustee has requested a determination of whether, under the no-contest provision, a beneficiary's interest in the trust, a person's power of appointment, or a person's power of withdrawal was reduced or eliminated.  A trustee or any other interested person may commence a judicial proceeding for purposes of determining whether a trustee's exercise of discretion under subsection (f) or (g) was made in good faith.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the power to amend or modify the trust instrument to take advantage of changes in the rule against perpetuities, laws governing restraints on alienation, or other state laws restricting the terms of the trust, the distribution of trust property, or the administration of the trust;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the power to appoint a successor trust protector or trust advisor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(9) the power to increase or decrease any interest of the beneficiaries in the trust, to grant a power of appointment to one or more trust beneficiaries, or to terminate or amend any power of appointment granted in the trust;  however, a modification, amendment or grant of a power of appointment may not grant a beneficial interest in a charitable trust with only charitable beneficiaries to any non-charitable interest or purpose and may not grant a beneficial interest in any trust to the trust protector or trust advisor, or to the estate or for the benefit of the creditors of such trust protector or such trust advisor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) the power to perform a specific duty or function that would normally be required of a trustee or cotrustee;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

A trust advisor of a charitable trust or a trust protector of a charitable trust is a fiduciary with respect to each power granted to that trust advisor or trust protector.  Notwithstanding the breadth of discretion granted to a trust advisor or trust protector under the terms of the trust, including the use of such terms as "absolute,'' "sole,'' or "uncontrolled,'' a trust advisor or trust protector must exercise a discretionary power and otherwise act in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the trust, the purposes of the trust, and the interests of the beneficiaries.

(b) A trust advisor or trust protector is an excluded fiduciary with respect to each power granted or reserved exclusively to any one or more other trustees, trust advisors, or trust protectors.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whenever, pursuant to the terms of a trust, an agreement of the qualified beneficiaries, or a court order, an excluded fiduciary is to follow the direction of a trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector with respect to investment decisions, distribution decisions, or other decisions of the non-excluded fiduciary, then, except to the extent that the terms of the trust, the agreement of the qualified beneficiaries, or the court order provide otherwise, the excluded fiduciary shall have no duty to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) monitor the conduct of the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(3) communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the excluded fiduciary would or might have exercised the excluded fiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the actions of the excluded fiduciary pertaining to matters within the scope of the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector's authority (such as confirming that the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector's direction or other information pursuant to RSA 564-B:8-813), shall be presumed to be administrative actions taken by the excluded fiduciary solely to allow the excluded fiduciary to perform those duties assigned to the excluded fiduciary under the terms of the trust, the agreement of the qualified beneficiaries, or the court order, and such administrative actions shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector's authority.
