(2) under the terms of the trust, an applicable statute, or common law, the trustee or other person to whom the power is properly granted or delegated has the power to sell, mortgage, or lease trust property for any period of time beyond the period that, if this section did not apply to the trust, would be required for an interest in the trust to vest in order to be valid under the rule against perpetuities.
