<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a trustee who invests and manages trust assets owes a duty to the beneficiaries of the trust to comply with the prudent investor rule set forth in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prudent investor rule may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the terms of the trust except as provided in RSA 564-B:1-105(b)(2) and (3).  A trustee is not liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reasonable reliance on the provisions of the trust or court order or determined not to diversify the investments of a trust in good faith in reliance on the express terms of the trust or a court order or pursuant to RSA 564-B:9-903.
