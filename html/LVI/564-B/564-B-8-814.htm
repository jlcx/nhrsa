<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Notwithstanding the breadth of discretion granted to a trustee in the terms of the trust, including the use of such terms as "absolute,'' "sole,'' or "uncontrolled,'' the trustee shall exercise a discretionary power in good faith and in accordance with the terms and purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a), if a distribution to or for the benefit of a beneficiary is subject to the exercise of the trustee's discretion, whether or not the terms of a trust include a standard to guide the trustee in making distribution decisions, then the beneficiary's interest is neither a property interest nor an enforceable right, but a mere expectancy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a), unless the terms of the trust expressly provide otherwise, if the terms of a trust permit distributions among a class of beneficiaries, distributions to or for the benefit of whom are subject to the exercise of the trustee's discretion without a standard to guide the trustee in making distribution decisions, then the trustee may make distributions unequally among the beneficiaries and may make distributions entirely to one beneficiary to the exclusion of the other beneficiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Subject to paragraph (f), and unless the terms of the trust expressly indicate that a rule in this paragraph does not apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a person other than a settlor who is a beneficiary and trustee of a trust that confers on the trustee a power to make discretionary distributions to or for the trustee's personal benefit may exercise the power only in accordance with an ascertainable standard;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) a trustee may not exercise a power to make discretionary distributions to satisfy a legal obligation of support that the trustee personally owes another person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A power whose exercise is limited or prohibited by paragraph (d) may be exercised by a majority of the remaining trustees whose exercise of the power is not so limited or prohibited.  If the power of all trustees is so limited or prohibited, the court may appoint a special trustee with authority to exercise the power.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Paragraph (d) does not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a power held by the settlor's spouse who is the trustee of a trust for which a marital deduction was previously allowed under section 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) any trust during any period that the trust may be revoked or amended by its settlor;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) a trust if contributions to the trust qualify for the annual exclusion under section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
