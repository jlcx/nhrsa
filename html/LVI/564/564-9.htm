<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A trustee who, in the opinion of the judge, becomes incompetent, unsuitable, or who shall neglect or refuse to comply with the provisions of this chapter may be removed following a hearing which is preceded by notice to the trustee, all known beneficiaries, and such other persons determined by the judge to be interested in the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A beneficiary or co-trustee of a trust who believes that the existing trustee should be replaced by a more suitable trustee may petition the court for such replacement.  Upon receiving such a petition, and upon the court's determination that all other known beneficiaries have been notified, the court may remove the existing trustee and appoint a replacement trustee when, upon considering all relevant factors, the court finds that a change in trustee would be in keeping with the intent of the grantor, provided further that in deciding whether to replace a trustee, the court may consider the following additional factors in making such determination:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It would substantially improve or benefit the administration of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The relationship between the grantor and the trustee as it existed at the time the trust was created.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Changes in the nature of the trustee since the creation of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The relationship of the trustee with the beneficiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The responsiveness of the trustee to the beneficiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The experience and level of skill of the trustee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The investment performance of the trustee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The charges for services performed by the trustee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Any other reasonable factors pertaining to the administration of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
