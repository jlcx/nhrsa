<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The trustee, or other person to whom the power is properly granted or delegated, has the power under the governing instrument, applicable statute, or common law, to sell, mortgage, or lease property for any period of time beyond the period that is required for an interest created under the governing instrument to vest in order to be valid under the rule against perpetuities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
