&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the department determines that a primary standard has violated, or that, in its judgment, a condition exists in a public water system which will cause a violation of a primary standard and may result in a serious risk to public health, it may issue an order requiring:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The prohibition of transportation, sale, distribution or supplying of water;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The repair, installation or operation of purification equipment or methods;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The notification of all potential users of the system, including travelers, of the nature, extent and possible health effects of the imminent hazard, and precautions to be taken by users;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The testing, sampling or other analytical operations required to determine the nature, extent, duration or termination of the imminent hazard.
<br>
The superior court shall place any action filed by the department to enforce an order under this section at the top of its calendar of cases and shall provide an expeditious hearing on such order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any reckless violation of any provision of this chapter, any rule adopted under this chapter, any term or condition of an approval, exemption, variance or order issued under this chapter, or any misstatement of a material fact required to be disclosed under this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor for a natural person and a felony for any other person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unless otherwise provided, any purposeful or knowing violation of any provision of this chapter, any rule adopted under this chapter, any term or condition of an approval, exemption, variance, or order issued under this chapter, or any misstatement of a material fact required to be disclosed under this chapter shall constitute a class B felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or any rule adopted or any term or condition of an approval, exemption, variance or order issued under this chapter shall be liable to the state, upon suit brought by the attorney general, for a civil forfeiture in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each day of such violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner of environmental services, after notice and hearing pursuant to RSA 541-A, may impose an administrative fine not to exceed $2,000 for each offense upon any person who violates any provision of this chapter including any rule adopted under the provisions of this chapter.  Rehearings and appeals from a decision of the commissioner under this paragraph shall be in accordance with RSA 541.  Any administrative fine imposed under this section shall not preclude the imposition of further penalties under this chapter.  The proceeds of administrative fines levied pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited by the department in the general fund.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, relative to:
<br>
