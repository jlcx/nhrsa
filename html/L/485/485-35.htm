Whenever the department, upon investigation, becomes satisfied that a well, spring or other supply of water, used for domestic purposes, has become polluted so as to endanger the public health, it is authorized to prohibit the person or corporation owning or controlling said supply from furnishing such water for domestic purposes, until it becomes satisfied that said water supply has been purified and made fit for domestic use.  Any person who knowingly violates the order of the department is guilty of a class B felony for each day he or she continues to furnish water after the order of the department has been served on such person.
