&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A, after public hearing, establishing a schedule of reasonable fees to be paid by any laboratory applying for accreditation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The schedule of fees shall be designed to recover the costs associated with the accreditation services provided under RSA 485:44, and such fees shall be available to the department to be used to defray the expenses for such services.  Funds received shall be deposited in a special revolving fund account maintained by the department which shall be continuously appropriated to the department to offset the costs of the accreditation program.  Any balance in excess of $1,000 remaining at the end of the fiscal year shall lapse to the general fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A laboratory shall provide each prospective New Hampshire client with a list which clearly indicates the specific analytes which the laboratory is accredited to test.  In the event that a client has paid a fee to a laboratory in anticipation of testing services before the receipt of said test sampling materials, and the client subsequently determines upon receipt of the test materials that the laboratory is not accredited to provide testing services to meet the client's needs, the client may cancel the order for any testing services which have not yet been performed, and the laboratory shall make full refund to the client.  Test reports shall clearly identify those specific analytes for which a laboratory has accreditation and shall specifically identify any analyses which were subcontracted to other laboratories.
