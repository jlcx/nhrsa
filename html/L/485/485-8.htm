No new construction, addition, or alteration involving the source, treatment, distribution, or storage of water in any public water system or privately owned redistribution system shall be commenced until the plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved in accordance with rules adopted by the department;  except, if such construction, addition, or alteration is exempted by the department because it will have no effect on public health or welfare, then such submission and approval is not required.  In granting approval of plans and specifications, the department may require modifications, conditions, or procedures to ensure, as far as feasible, the protection of the public health.
