&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner is authorized to promote such regional or federal efforts as may be required to reduce the ongoing contamination threat posed by MTBE and other gasoline ethers, including but not limited to efforts to eliminate the federal oxygen mandate in the federal Clean Air Act, secure waivers from federal fuel requirements, or implement cleaner, more protective reformulation of gasoline.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an alternative regional or federal approach to cleaner gasoline is developed which provides equal or greater effectiveness in reducing concentrations of MTBE and other gasoline ethers than opting out of the federal reformulated gasoline program under RSA 485:16-b, I, or does so in a manner that requires less costly substitute emission control measures under RSA 485:16-c, then the commissioner may implement such alternative regional or federal approach.  Such alternative regional or federal approach may substitute for opting out of the federal reformulated gasoline program under RSA 485:16-b, I if undertaken prior to January 1, 2004.
