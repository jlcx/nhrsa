&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485:3 Drinking Water Rules. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall adopt under RSA 541-A, following public hearing, drinking water rules and primary drinking water standards which are necessary to protect the public health and which shall apply to all public water systems.  Such rules shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) identification of contaminants which may have an adverse effect on the health of persons;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) specification for each contaminant of either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a maximum contaminant level that is acceptable in water for human consumption, if it is feasible to ascertain the level of such contaminant in water in public water systems;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) one or more treatment techniques or methods which lead to a reduction of the level of such contaminant sufficient to protect the public health, if it is not feasible to ascertain the level of such contaminant in water in the public water system;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) criteria and procedures to assure compliance with the levels or methods determined under subparagraph (b), including quality control monitoring and testing procedures and standards to ensure compliance with such levels or methods;  criteria and standards to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the system;  requirements as to the minimum quality of water which may be delivered to the consumer;  and requirements with respect to siting new facilities.  Such rules shall be no less stringent than the most recent national Primary Drinking Water Regulations in effect, as issued or promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may adopt secondary drinking water rules, which are necessary to protect the public welfare.  Such rules may apply to any contaminant in drinking water which may adversely affect the color, odor, taste or appearance of the water and consequently may cause a substantial number of persons to discontinue using a public water system, or which may otherwise adversely affect the public welfare.  Such rules may vary according to geographic, economic, technical or other relevant circumstances.  Such rules shall reasonably assure the protection of the public welfare and the supply of aesthetically adequate drinking water.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner shall adopt under RSA 541-A all rules necessary to implement the requirements of the following sections of this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) RSA 485:42.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) RSA 485:43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may adopt rules specifying criteria and procedures for requiring public water systems to conduct monitoring programs for contaminants which are not identified in the national primary drinking water regulations, but which have been identified by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency as "unregulated contaminants.''  Such rules shall require monitoring of drinking water supplied by the system and shall vary the frequency and schedule of monitoring requirements for systems.  An unregulated contaminant is one for which no maximum contaminant level or treatment technique has been established under paragraph I or II.  In developing such rules, the commissioner shall consider materials submitted by the department of health and human services, pursuant to RSA 125-H:3.  Rules adopted under this paragraph shall list unregulated contaminants for which public water systems may be required to monitor.  Any list established pursuant to this paragraph shall be consistent with, but not limited by, the list of unregulated contaminants identified in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may adopt rules specifying the criteria under which filtration, including coagulation and sedimentation, as appropriate, is required as a treatment technique for public water systems supplied by surface water sources.  In developing such rules the commissioner shall consider the quality of source waters, protection afforded by watershed management, treatment practices such as disinfection and length of water storage and other factors relevant to protection of health.  The commissioner may require any public water supply system to assist in determining the necessity of filtration in that system.  The commissioner shall provide an opportunity for notice and public hearing prior to implementation of any filtration requirement.  Following such hearing, the commissioner shall prescribe, by rule adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A, a compliance schedule for such filtration requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner may adopt rules requiring disinfection as a treatment technique for all public water systems.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner may adopt rules specifying the criteria and procedures to be used to identify and notify persons who may be affected by lead contamination of their drinking water when such contamination results from either the lead content in the construction materials of the public water system or the corrosivity of the water supply, or both.  The commissioner may also adopt rules prohibiting the use of lead pipes, solder and flux in the installation or repair of any public water system or any plumbing in a residential or nonresidential facility providing water for human consumption.  Such rules shall not prohibit the use of leaded joints necessary for the repair of cast iron pipes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner may adopt rules relative to defining the best available technology, treatment techniques, or other means which are feasible for the purpose of meeting the federal maximum contaminant level.  In defining the best available technology, treatment technique or other means, the commissioner may consider the number of persons served by the system, other physical conditions related to engineering feasibility and cost of compliance, and information contained in health risk assessments provided by the department of health and human services pursuant to RSA 125-H:3, II and IV.  Such rules shall specify all applicable criteria relative to the commissioner's determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The commissioner may adopt rules to implement a wellhead protection program pursuant to RSA 485:48.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The commissioner may adopt rules to implement the Underground Injection Control Program of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. section 300f et seq., as well as rules pertaining to permits for the regulation and remediation of contamination from previous discharges or disposal of waste to the groundwater.  The commissioner's rules shall include criteria and procedures to ensure that past and present underground injection will not endanger drinking water sources, and shall provide for consideration of varying geologic, hydrologic, or other conditions in different areas within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, specifying the water quality standards and other criteria and procedures for obtaining a permit to use a source of water for the manufacture of bottled water.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The commissioner may adopt rules to ensure long-term viability of public drinking water systems as required by section 119 of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, 42 U.S.C. section 300g-9 to qualify for full eligibility for federal and state revolving fund capital grants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to new groundwater withdrawals of 57,600 gallons or more in any 24-hour period by public water systems.  Such rules shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Criteria and procedures for requiring public water systems to identify and address impacts of withdrawals on surface waters, subsurface waters, water-related natural resources, and public, private, residential, and farm wells within the anticipated zone of contribution to the withdrawal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Requirements relative to conservation management plans which demonstrate the need for the proposed withdrawals, to be submitted by the public water system seeking approval for a withdrawal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Procedures by which the department may deny permission for withdrawals or order the applicant to provide a response policy, as provided by department rules, for provision of alternative water supply at no initial capital cost to persons whose wells are adversely affected by the proposed withdrawal or order reduced withdrawals if hydrogeologic data indicate that water-related resources are being adversely affected by the withdrawals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. The commissioner may adopt rules to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Regulate the heat exchange fluids utilized in closed loop geothermal systems.  The commissioner's rules shall include criteria and procedures to ensure that these substances when released to the environment will not endanger drinking water sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prohibit the construction of open loop geothermal systems where such process will contaminate freshwater aquifers with brackish or saline groundwater.

The department shall examine the topography and the watershed, complete an engineering review of the plans and specifications for said proposed construction, and make chemical and bacteriological analysis of the waters of the proposed supply, before approval is granted.  The requirements of this paragraph shall only apply to privately owned redistribution systems if the construction or enlargement of an existing system involves more than 500 feet of new installation of distribution piping or the addition of any new exterior pumping or water storage facility.  Any review of plans for a privately owned redistribution system shall be completed within 30 days of the submission of such plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No new construction, addition, or alteration involving the source, treatment, distribution, or storage of water in any public water system or privately owned redistribution system shall be commenced until the plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved in accordance with rules adopted by the department;  except, if such construction, addition, or alteration is exempted by the department because it will have no effect on public health or welfare, then such submission and approval is not required.  In granting approval of plans and specifications, the department may require modifications, conditions, or procedures to ensure, as far as feasible, the protection of the public health.  The department may require the submission of water samples for analysis to determine the extent of treatment required.  Records of construction, including, where possible, plans and descriptions of existing public water systems and privately owned redistribution systems, shall be maintained by such systems and shall be made available to the department upon request.  The requirements of this paragraph shall only apply to privately owned redistribution systems if the construction, addition, or alteration of an existing system involves more than 500 feet of new installation of distribution piping or the addition of any new exterior pumping or water storage facility.  Any review of plans for a privately owned redistribution system shall be completed within 30 days of the submission of such plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person submitting detailed plans to the department, as provided in this section, for a new public water system, or an existing public water system where conversion from transient use to residential-type use is proposed, shall pay to the department a fee of $45 per residential unit.  When usage cannot be apportioned by residential units at new public water systems, the fee shall be based on the flow proportioned equivalent to that of a single family residential unit.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A defining flow proportioned equivalency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The fees required under paragraph III shall be for reviewing such detailed plans and making site inspections as may be necessary.  The fee shall be paid at the time said detailed plans are submitted and shall be deposited with the state treasurer as unrestricted revenue.  The department shall establish by rule, adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A, a minimum threshold below which no fee is required and a maximum level above which the fee will not increase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any person proposing to install new public sewerage or sewage treatment facilities, or to extend, renovate, replace or substantially repair any such existing facilities, shall submit, at least 30 days in advance of construction, detailed plans and specifications for such facilities to the department and secure its approval of such plans and specifications.  The foregoing provisions shall also be applicable to any institution accommodating 30 or more people, which provides its own sewage disposal facilities.

There shall be a backflow prevention device installed at every connection to a public water system if the facility connected may pose a hazard to the quality of water supplied by the public water system as determined by the department.  Where applicable, the facility receiving water from a public water supply shall be responsible for having such drinking water distribution system protective backflow prevention devices inspected and tested by individuals certified by a third party who has been approved by the department to conduct backflow device inspection and testing certification.  The facility shall also have backflow devices installed, maintained, repaired, and replaced by individuals qualified by either a plumbers license or by certification by the department under RSA 332-E:3, III proving competency in distribution system operation.  The activities to be conducted by qualified individuals shall be specifically limited to the inspection and testing, maintenance, repair or replacement, and installation of the water meters, meter horns, backflow preventers, and assembly devices directly adjacent to and required as part of the protection for the drinking water distribution system.  Testing of drinking water distribution system protective backflow prevention devices, where applicable, shall occur after installation or repair to ensure that new and repaired devices are working properly.  There shall be a backflow prevention device installed at every connection to a public water system if the facility connected may pose a hazard to the quality of water supplied by the public water system as determined by the department of environmental services.  The facility receiving water from a public water supply shall be responsible for having such backflow prevention devices installed, serviced, and tested by individuals qualified by license or certification to perform these activities.  Testing of backflow devices shall occur twice annually unless the public water supplier determines the facility poses a low hazard, in which case testing shall be performed on an annual basis.  The facility receiving water from a public water supplier is responsible for ensuring that the backflow prevention device is working properly to prevent backflow into the public water system.  Testing shall also occur twice annually for any high hazard devices and facilities.  When the public water supplier determines that the facility poses a low hazard, testing shall occur annually.  A residential property containing a non-testable device shall not be considered a hazard facility and shall not require annual testing.  A residential property may be considered a high hazard facility if it has an irrigation system, private well connection, or other feature that may cause a public health risk.  If an outside irrigation system is the sole reason a residential property is considered a hazard to the public water supply distribution system, such irrigation system shall be tested annually during the period when the irrigation system is operated.  The facility receiving water from a public water supplier is responsible for ensuring that the backflow prevention device is working properly to prevent backflow into the public water system.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, grant one or more variances from an applicable state drinking water regulation to a public water system if the variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to the public health, and if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Because of the characteristics of the raw water sources reasonably available to the system, the system cannot meet the maximum contaminant levels of such drinking water regulation despite application of the best available technology, treatment techniques or other means.  The department's finding of the best available technology treatment, treatment technique or other means may vary depending upon the number of persons served by the system or for other physical conditions related to engineering feasibility and cost of compliance with maximum contaminant levels as considered appropriate by the department;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Where a specified treatment technique for a contaminant is required by the state drinking water regulations, the system demonstrates to the department's satisfaction that such treatment technique is not required to protect the public health because of the nature of the raw water source.  Variances may be conditioned on monitoring, testing, analyzing or other requirements to ensure the protection of the public health, and variances granted under subparagraph (a) shall include a compliance schedule under which the public water system will meet each contaminant level for which a variance is granted as expeditiously as is feasible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, grant one or more exemptions from an applicable maximum contaminant level or treatment technique in the state drinking water rules to a public water system if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to the public health;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The public water system is unable to comply with the rule due to compelling factors, which may include economic factors;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The public water system was in operation on the earliest effective date, under present or prior law, of the contaminant level or treatment technique requirement.  Each exemption shall be conditioned on monitoring, testing, analyzing or other requirements to ensure the protection of the public health, and shall include a compliance schedule under which the public water system will meet each contaminant level or treatment technique for which an exemption is granted as expeditiously as is feasible, but not later than 12 months after the date of issuance of the exemption.  The department may extend the final date for compliance provided in any schedule required under this section for a period not to exceed 3 years after the date of the issuance of the exemption if the public water system establishes that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The system cannot meet the standard without capital improvements which cannot be completed within the period of such exemption;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In the case of a system which needs financial assistance for the necessary improvements, the system has entered into an agreement to obtain such financial assistance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The system has entered into an enforceable agreement to become part of a regional public water system;  and the system is taking all practicable steps to meet the standards.
<br>
If a system serves fewer than 500 service connections and needs financial assistance for necessary improvements, an exemption granted under subparagraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this subparagraph may be renewed for one or more additional 2-year periods, if the system establishes that it is taking all practicable steps to meet the requirements of any compliance schedule established under this section.
