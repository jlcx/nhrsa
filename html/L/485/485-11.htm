<codesect>
Every valve, gate or other device for controlling or preventing the inflow of water of such unapproved character to the public supply pipe system must be constructed to permit efficient inspection and testing, and an actual test of such device shall be made not less than twice annually by the individual, corporation or association furnishing water to the public.  If the water supply management shall find that a gate or valve is not working properly, and cannot be readily adjusted, it shall at once notify the department, and, under the advice and direction of said department, shall repair or correct the faulty condition.
