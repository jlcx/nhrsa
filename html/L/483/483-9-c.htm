&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner, in consultation with the advisory committee, shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A specifying the standards, criteria, and procedures by which a protected instream flow shall be established and enforced for each designated river or segment.  Each protected instream flow shall be established and enforced to maintain water for instream public uses and to protect outstanding characteristics, including recreational, fisheries, wildlife, environmental, hydropower, cultural, historical, archaeological, scientific, ecological, aesthetic, community significance, agricultural, public water supply, and the resources for which the river or segment is designated, and shall respect riparian interests on each designated river or segment consistent with the purposes of this chapter.  Instream public uses shall include the state's interests in surface waters, including, but not limited to, navigation;  recreation;  fishing;  storage;  conservation;  maintenance and enhancement of aquatic and fish life;  fish and wildlife habitat;  wildlife;  the protection of water quality and public health;  pollution abatement;  aesthetic beauty;  and hydroelectric energy production.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. One public hearing shall be held in at least one municipality along the designated river or segment to receive public comment on the establishment of a proposed protected instream flow.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The procedure adopted under this section shall include an assessment of the effect of a protected instream flow upon existing hydroelectric power generation, water supply, flood control, and other riparian users.  For any portion of a designated river or segment where a protected instream flow would affect the operation of an existing hydroelectric power facility within or upstream from the designated river or segment, the commissioner shall request the assistance of the public utilities commission in order to assess the effect of a protected instream flow upon such facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The protected instream flow levels established under this section shall be maintained at all times, except when inflow is less than the protected instream flow level as a result of natural causes or when the commissioner determines that a public water supply emergency exists which affects public health and safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The maintenance of protected instream flows shall constitute a condition of any permit issued by the department for any project or activity within a designated river or segment and corridor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any party who is aggrieved by a determination establishing such protected instream flows may petition the commissioner for a hearing to review such determination within 30 days of the date the determination is issued.  The filing of such petition shall stay the implementation of the determination until a final decision has been rendered on the petition or an appeal taken pursuant to RSA 541.
