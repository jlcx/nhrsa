<codesect>
The general court finds that the development of any dam or channel alteration activities within a natural river or segment or the development of any new dam within a rural, rural-community, or community river or segment, except as provided in RSA 483:9-a, II, RSA 483:9-aa, II, and RSA 483:9-b, II, will alter the physical and chemical characteristics of that river and will constitute violation of the water quality standards established under RSA 485-A:8.  The commissioner shall deny certification of any federally licensed or permitted activity on such designated rivers or segments under section 401 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, P.L. 92-500, as amended.
