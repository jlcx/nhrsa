&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483:2 Program Established;  Intent.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
There is established within the department of environmental services the New Hampshire rivers management and protection program.  It is the intent of the legislature that the New Hampshire rivers management and protection program shall complement and reinforce existing state and federal water quality laws, and that in-stream flows are maintained along protected rivers, or segments thereof, in a manner that will enhance or not diminish the enjoyment of outstanding river characteristics pursuant to RSA 483:1.  It is also the intent of the legislature that, through said program, the outstanding characteristics including recreational, fisheries, wildlife, environmental, hydropower, cultural, historical, archaeological, scientific, ecological, aesthetic, community significance, agricultural, public water supply, instream public uses, and riparian rights of such rivers shall be restored, protected, and maintained, and notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 483-B, that nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to preempt any land and zoning authority granted to municipal bodies under RSA title LXIV.
