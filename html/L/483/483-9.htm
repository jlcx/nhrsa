<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Permanent alterations in conjunction with the repair or maintenance of a bridge, road, or riprap which is in place at the time a river or segment is designated which have only de minimis impact to or restore the channel's geomorphic characteristics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The department shall review and consider adopted local river corridor management plans prior to issuing any permit under RSA 485-A:13 or RSA 485-A:17.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any new solid waste storage or treatment facility, as defined in RSA 149-M:4, IX shall be set back a minimum of 250 feet from the normal high water mark of a designated natural river or segment and screened with a vegetative or other natural barrier to minimize visual impact, except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) New solid waste landfills shall not be permitted within the corridor of a designated natural river or segment, or less than 100 feet from the landward extent of the 500 year floodplain, whichever distance is greater, and shall be screened from the river with a vegetative or other natural barrier to minimize visual impact;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Expansion of existing solid waste landfills shall not occur within the 500 year floodplain of a designated natural river or segment and any expansion of such a landfill located within the corridor of a designated natural river or segment shall be set back a minimum of 100 feet from the landward extent of the 500 year floodplain and screened from the river with a vegetative or other natural barrier to minimize visual impact;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any land application within the river corridor of septage, sludge, or solid waste, as defined in RSA 149-M:4, XXII, shall be set back a minimum of 250 feet from the normal high water mark and shall be immediately incorporated into the soil.  The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to manure, lime, or wood ash when used for agricultural purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An existing solid waste facility which is located within 250 feet of the normal high water mark of a designated natural river or segment may continue to operate under an existing permit provided it does not cause degradation to an area in excess of that area under permit at the time of designation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The department may permit a resource recovery operation at an existing landfill located within 250 feet of the normal high water mark of a designated natural river or segment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
