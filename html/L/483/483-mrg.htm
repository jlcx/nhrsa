&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483:1 Statement of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
New Hampshire's rivers and streams comprise one of its most important natural resources, historically vital to New Hampshire's commerce, industry, and tourism, and the quality of life of New Hampshire people.  It is the policy of the state to ensure the continued viability of New Hampshire rivers as valued ecologic, economic, public health and safety, and social assets for the benefit of present and future generations.  The state shall encourage and assist in the development of river corridor management plans and regulate the quantity and quality of instream flow along certain protected rivers or segments of rivers to conserve and protect outstanding characteristics including recreational, fisheries, wildlife, environmental, hydropower, cultural, historical, archaeological, scientific, ecological, aesthetic, community significance, agricultural, and public water supply so that these valued characteristics shall endure as part of the river uses to be enjoyed by New Hampshire people.  If conflicts arise in the attempt to protect all valued characteristics within a river or stream, priority shall be given to those characteristics that are necessary to meet state water quality standards.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483:2 Program Established;  Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
There is established within the department of environmental services the New Hampshire rivers management and protection program.  It is the intent of the legislature that the New Hampshire rivers management and protection program shall complement and reinforce existing state and federal water quality laws, and that in-stream flows are maintained along protected rivers, or segments thereof, in a manner that will enhance or not diminish the enjoyment of outstanding river characteristics pursuant to RSA 483:1.  It is also the intent of the legislature that, through said program, the scenic beauty and recreational potential of such rivers shall be restored and maintained, that riparian interests shall be respected, and that nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to preempt any land and zoning authority granted to municipal bodies under RSA title LXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483:7-a River Classification Criteria;  Management. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Those rivers or segments designated for inclusion in the program shall be classified as one or more of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Natural rivers are free-flowing rivers or segments characterized by the high quality of natural and scenic resources.  River shorelines are in primarily natural vegetation and river corridors are generally undeveloped.  Development, if any, is limited to forest management and scattered housing.  For natural rivers, the following criteria and management objectives shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The minimum length of any segment shall be 5 miles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Existing water quality shall be not lower than Class B level pursuant to the water quality standards established under RSA 485-A:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The minimum distance from the river shoreline to a paved road open to the public for motor vehicle use shall be 250 feet, except where a vegetative or other natural barrier exists which effectively screens the sight and sound of motor vehicles for a majority of the length of the river or segment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Management of natural rivers and segments shall perpetuate their natural condition as defined in this chapter and shall consider, protect, and ensure the rights of riparian owners to use the river for forest management, agricultural, public water supply, and other purposes which are compatible with instream public uses of the river and the management and protection of the resources for which the river or segment is designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Rural rivers are those rivers or segments adjacent to lands which are partially or predominantly used for agriculture, forest management and dispersed or clustered residential development.  Some instream structures may exist, including low dams, diversion works and other minor modifications.  The following criteria and management objectives shall apply to rural rivers:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The minimum length of any segment shall be 3 miles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Existing water quality shall be at least Class B level pursuant to the water quality standards established under RSA 485-A:8 or have the potential for restoration to that level.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) There shall be no minimum distance from the shoreline to an existing road.  Roads may parallel the river shoreline with regular bridge crossings and public access sites.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Management of rural rivers and segments shall maintain and enhance the natural, scenic, and recreational values of the river and shall consider, protect and ensure the rights of riparian owners to use the river for agricultural, forest management, public water supply, and other purposes which are compatible with the instream public uses of the river and the management and protection of the resources for which the river or segment is designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Rural-community rivers are those rivers or segments which flow through developed or populated areas of the state and which possess existing or potential community resource values such as those defined in official municipal plans or land use controls.  Such rivers have mixed land uses in the corridor reflecting some combination of open space, agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial land uses.  Such rivers are readily accessible by road or railroad and may include impoundments or diversions.  The following criteria and management objectives shall apply to rural-community rivers:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The minimum length of any segment shall be 3 miles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Existing water quality shall be at least Class B level pursuant to the water quality standards established under RSA 485-A:8, or have the potential for restoration to that level.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Management of rural-community rivers and segments shall maintain and enhance the natural, scenic, recreational and community values of the river and shall consider, protect, and ensure the rights of riparian owners to use the river for such uses as agricultural, forest management, public water supply, residential, recreational, commercial, industrial, flood control, and other community uses which are compatible with the instream public uses of the river and the management and protection of the resources for which the river or segment is designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Community rivers are those rivers or segments which flow through developed or populated areas of the state and which possess existing or potential community resource values, such as those identified in official municipal plans or land use controls.  Such rivers have mixed land uses in the corridor reflecting some combination of open space, agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial land uses.  Such rivers are readily accessible by road or railroad, may include existing impoundments or diversions, or potential sites for new impoundments or diversions for hydropower, flood control or water supply purposes, and may include the urban centers of municipalities.  The following criteria and management objectives shall apply to community rivers:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The minimum length of any segment shall be one mile.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Existing water quality shall be at least Class B level pursuant to the water quality standards established under RSA 485-A:8, or have the potential for restoration to that level.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Management of community rivers and segments shall maintain and enhance the natural, scenic, recreational and community values of the river and shall consider, protect, and ensure the rights of riparian owners to use the river for such uses as agricultural, forest management, public water supply, residential, recreational, commercial, industrial, flood control and hydroelectric energy production purposes which are compatible with the instream public uses of the river and the management and protection of the resources for which the river or segment is designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The existence of limited exceptions to the criteria for a certain classification under this section shall not necessarily exclude a river or segment from that classification.  The river or segment shall be examined as a whole, and the classification of such river or segment shall be based on the overall values and characteristics of such river or segment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A designated river and its tributary drainage area rivers that are subsequently designated shall be listed in the same paragraph in RSA 483:15.  Each tributary river shall be named in a subparagraph under the main stem, and designated segments of each tributary shall be listed as further subparagraphs under each tributary.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any state agency considering any action affecting any river or segment designated under this chapter shall notify the rivers coordinator prior to taking any such action.  Such agency shall forward to the rivers coordinator for review and comment copies of all notices of public hearings, or, where a public hearing is not required, a copy of the application for issuance of a permit, certificate, or license within the designated river or corridor under RSA 485-C, RSA 485-A, RSA 483-B, RSA 12-E, RSA 270:12, RSA 482, RSA 482-A, RSA 149-M, RSA 430, or RSA 147-A.  If an agency is notified by the rivers coordinator that a proposed activity would violate a protection measure under RSA 483:9, 483:9-a, 483:9-aa, or 483:9-b, such agency shall deny the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The rivers coordinator shall develop, in conjunction with affected state agencies and local river management advisory committees, the procedure by which the state shall notify the appropriate local river management advisory committee when state action is being considered which affects a designated river.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an application is denied solely because the proposed activity would violate a protection measure under RSA 483:9, 483:9-a, 483:9-aa, or 483:9-b, the applicant may petition the commissioner for a review.  Within 30 days of receiving such a petition, the commissioner, in consultation with the advisory committee and the appropriate local rivers management advisory committee, shall review the application.  If the commissioner determines that the proposed activity is consistent with the character of the designated river or segment or that the proposed activity would provide a public benefit sufficient to outweigh the public benefit of a protection measure under this chapter, the commissioner shall submit to the speaker of the house and the president of the senate a recommendation that the proposed activity be allowed to proceed.  Such recommendation shall require review and approval by the general court and shall be filed as a bill in the next legislative session following the petition.
