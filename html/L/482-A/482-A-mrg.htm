&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 482-A:1 Finding of Public Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is found to be for the public good and welfare of this state to protect and preserve its submerged lands under tidal and fresh waters and its wetlands, (both salt water and fresh-water), as herein defined, from despoliation and unregulated alteration, because such despoliation or unregulated alteration will adversely affect the value of such areas as sources of nutrients for finfish, crustacea, shellfish and wildlife of significant value, will damage or destroy habitats and reproduction areas for plants, fish and wildlife of importance, will eliminate, depreciate or obstruct the commerce, recreation and aesthetic enjoyment of the public, will be detrimental to adequate groundwater levels, will adversely affect stream channels and their ability to handle the runoff of waters, will disturb and reduce the natural ability of wetlands to absorb flood waters and silt, thus increasing general flood damage and the silting of open water channels, and will otherwise adversely affect the interests of the general public.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) The time limits prescribed by this paragraph shall supersede any time limits provided in any other provision of law.  If the department fails to act within the applicable time frame established in subparagraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5), the applicant may ask the department to issue the permit by submitting a written request.  If the applicant has previously agreed to accept communications from the department by electronic means, a request submitted electronically by the applicant shall constitute a written request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Within 14 days of the date of receipt of a written request from the applicant to issue the permit, the department shall:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the department does not issue either a permit or a written denial within the 14-day period, the applicant shall be deemed to have a permit by default and may proceed with the project as presented in the application.  The authorization provided by this subparagraph shall not relieve the applicant of complying with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter, RSA 485-A relating to water quality, and federal requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Upon receipt of a written request from an applicant, the department shall issue written confirmation that the applicant has a permit by default pursuant to subparagraph (b)(3), which authorizes the applicant to proceed with the project as presented in the application and requires the work to comply with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter, and RSA 485-A relating to water quality, and federal requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If extraordinary circumstances prevent the department from conducting its normal function, time frames prescribed by this paragraph shall be suspended until such condition has ended, as determined by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The time limits prescribed by this paragraph shall not apply to an application filed after the applicant has already undertaken some or all of the work covered by the application, or where the applicant has been adjudicated after final appeal, or otherwise does not contest, the department's designation as a chronic non-complier in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any request for a significant amendment to a pending application or an existing permit which changes the footprint of the permitted fill or dredge area shall be deemed a new application subject to the provisions of RSA 482-A:3, I and the time limits prescribed by this paragraph.  "Significant amendment'' means an amendment which changes the proposed or previously approved acreage of the permitted fill or dredge area by 20 percent or more, relocates the proposed footprint of the permitted fill or dredge area, includes a prime wetland or surface waters of the state, includes a wetland of a different classification as classified by the department, or includes non-wetland areas requiring permits for filling and dredging.  This meaning of "significant amendment'' shall not apply to an application amendment that is in response to a request from the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The department may extend the time for rendering a decision under subparagraphs (a)(3)(D) and (a)(4)(D), without the applicant's agreement, on an application from an applicant who previously has been determined, after the exhaustion of available appellate remedies, to have failed to comply with this chapter or any rule adopted or permit or approval issued under this chapter, or to have misrepresented any material fact made in connection with any activity regulated or prohibited by this chapter, pursuant to an action initiated under RSA 482-A:13, RSA 482-A:14, or RSA 482-A:14-b.  The length of such an extension shall be no longer than reasonably necessary to complete the review of the application, but shall not exceed 30 days unless the applicant agrees to a longer extension.  The department shall notify the applicant of the length of the extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The department may suspend review of an application for a proposed project on a property with respect to which the department has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for any violation of this chapter, RSA 483-B, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44, or of any rule adopted or permit or approval issued pursuant to this chapter, RSA 483-B, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44.  Any such suspension shall expire upon conclusion of the enforcement action and completion of any remedial actions the department may require to address the violation;  provided, however, that the department may resume its review of the application sooner if doing so will facilitate resolution of the violation.  The department shall resume its review of the application at the point the review was suspended, except that the department may extend any of the time limits under this paragraph and its rules up to a total of 30 days for all such extensions.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "enforcement action'' means an action under RSA 482-A:13, RSA 482-A:14, RSA 482-A:14-b, RSA 483-B:18, RSA 485-A:22, RSA 485-A:42, or RSA 485-A:43.

(4) The applicant proposes reasonable mitigation measures to protect the public waters of the state from deterioration during the period of extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any permit issued to repair or replace shoreline structures to maintain the integrity and safety of such structures including, but not limited to docks, sea walls, breakwaters, riprap, access ramps and stairs, that are damaged by storms or ice, shall expire 10 years from the date the permit was issued as long as any work performed after the initial permitted work complies with the following:

Permitted impacts to aquatic resources shall be postponed until such impacts become necessary for the operation of the excavation or mining area.  If there has not been excavation or mining of construction aggregate materials and quarry stone during any 5 year period, the project shall be deemed abandoned and the permit deemed expired.  When or if a new proposal to develop the property for a different use is proposed, a new application shall be submitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 482-A:10-a Damages. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If, upon appeal of the landowner, the superior court determines that the decision appealed from so exceeds the bounds of the police power as to constitute the equivalent of taking without compensation and that the land as so regulated meets the public purpose standards of this chapter, and if such ruling is affirmed on appeal or becomes the law of the trial by failure of the state to appeal, the superior court shall then proceed to the assessment of the landowner's damages.  Unless the department, at this stage, consents to the reversal or modification of its decision by the superior court, that court shall first determine all questions of land title, after notice to all persons interested in the land, including notice by publication to any unknown owners, and then shall assess the damages of the landowner or landowners proceeding as provided in RSA 482:35-38, inclusive, and RSA 498-A:27, and may enter judgment against the state accordingly.  The interest acquired by the state by virtue of such proceedings shall be a perpetual negative easement that the privately-owned land or interest in the land described in the proceedings shall not thereafter be excavated, removed, filled, dredged, canalized or ditched, subject to any such reasonable reservations to the landowner as the department may have stipulated to prior to the assessment of damages.  The state may, in the alternative, purchase the land or interest in the land in fee simple or other acceptable title, or subject to acceptable reservations and exceptions, by agreement with the landowner.  To satisfy any judgment or purchase agreement under this section, the governor and council, in their discretion, may draw their warrant on the marine fisheries fund, the fish and game fund, any other available appropriation for such purpose, or on any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, or any combination of such funds, as they may determine to be just and reasonable, or, in the alternative, they may certify a judgment to the next session of the general court for the passage of an appropriation of money sufficient to satisfy the same.  The department may, in the name of the state, accept gifts of land or interests in land for the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The use of the marine fisheries fund or the fish and game fund under paragraph I shall require a finding that the expenditure will be of substantial benefit to marine fisheries or to fish and wildlife, as the case may be, and the governor and council shall request the prior opinion of the fish and game commission in each such case.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 482-A:11 Administrative Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall adopt reasonable rules, pursuant to the rulemaking provisions of RSA 541-A, to implement the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Decisions of the department or council under this chapter shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter as set forth in RSA 482-A:1.  Before granting a permit under this chapter, the department may require reasonable proof of ownership by a private landowner-applicant.  If a permit is granted, the decision of the department may contain reasonable conditions designed to protect the public good.  No permit to dredge or fill shall be granted if it shall infringe on the property rights or unreasonably affect the value or enjoyment of property of abutting owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Upon written notification to the department by a municipal conservation commission that it intends to investigate any notice received by it pursuant to RSA 482-A:3, the department shall not make its decision on the application that is the subject of the notice until it has received and acknowledged receipt of a written report from such commission, or until 40 days from the date of filing with the municipal clerk of such notice, whichever occurs earlier, subject to an extension as permitted by the department.  In connection with any local investigation, a conservation commission may hold a public informational meeting or a public hearing, the record of which shall be made a part of the record of the department.  Where the department grants an extension, the time limits prescribed by RSA 482-A:3, XIV(b) shall be suspended until a date agreed to by the applicant and the department.  If a conservation commission makes a recommendation to the department in its report, the department shall specifically consider such recommendation and shall make written findings with respect to each issue raised in such report which is contrary to the decision of the department.  If notification by a local conservation commission pursuant to this paragraph is not received by the department within 14 days following the date the notice is filed with the municipal clerk, the department shall not suspend its normal action, but shall proceed as if no notification has been made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Relative to any permit by notification under paragraph VI, the provisions of subparagraph (a) shall be modified as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The 40-day suspended action limit is reduced to 21 days;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The notification by a municipal conservation commission of intended investigation shall be assumed unless the application filed under RSA 482-A:3 was signed by the conservation commission, or, if one has not been established in the municipality, by the local governing body, in which case the provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The department shall not grant a permit with respect to any project to be undertaken in an area mapped, designated, and filed as a prime wetland pursuant to RSA 482-A:15, or within 100 feet of any prime wetland where a 100 foot buffer was required at the time of designation, unless the department first notifies the local governing body, the planning board, if any, and the conservation commission, if any, in the municipality within which the wetlands lie, either in whole or in part, of its decision.  Any such permit shall not be issued unless the department is able, specifically, to find clear and convincing evidence on the basis of all information considered by the department, and after a public hearing, if a public hearing is deemed necessary under RSA 482-A:8, that the proposed project, either alone or in conjunction with other human activity, will not result in the significant net loss of any of the values set forth in RSA 482-A:1.  This paragraph shall not be construed so as to relieve the department of its statutory obligations under this chapter to protect wetlands not so mapped and designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) A property owner may request from the department a waiver from subparagraph (a), under rules adopted by the department, to perform forest management work and related activities in the forested portion of a prime wetland or its 100-foot buffer, where such buffer was required at the time of designation, that do not qualify under the notification of forest management or timber harvest activities having minimum wetlands impact process.  The request for the waiver shall include, but not be limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) A sketch of the property depicting the best approximate location of each prime wetland and its 100-foot buffer, where such buffer was required at the time of designation, in which work is proposed and the location of proposed work, including access roads;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) A written description of the work to be performed and a copy of the notice of intent to cut, if applicable;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) A list of the prime wetland values as identified by the municipality in designating each prime wetland under RSA 482-A:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A waiver shall be issued only when the department is able to determine there will be no significant net loss of wetland values as identified in subparagraph (b)(1)(C) and RSA 482-A:1.  If the department determines that the proposed work may cause a significant net loss of wetland values, the department may require the submittal of additional information.  The department may place conditions on the waiver that it deems necessary to protect the prime wetland resource and shall set the term of the permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) At the time that the waiver request is submitted to the department, the applicant shall also submit a copy of the waiver request and all supporting documentation, via certified mail, to the local governing body, the planning board, if any, and the conservation commission, if any, of the municipalities in which any prime wetlands associated with the application are located.  Where a prime wetland associated with the application extends into an abutting property, the property owner requesting the waiver shall provide notice to the owner of that abutting property.  A waiver shall not be issued by the department prior to 14 days from its receipt of the waiver request.  A municipal conservation commission may request an extension on such waiver issuance, not to exceed 14 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The department shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The process and criteria for considering and granting waiver requests made pursuant to RSA 482-A:11, IV(b)(1), including:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Methods for determining whether a proposed forest management project may result in a significant net loss of wetland values.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) Conditions that may be placed on a waiver when deemed necessary to protect the prime wetland resource.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) Criteria for granting extensions of waiver issuances pursuant to RSA 482-A:11, IV(b)(3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) Specified criteria for identifying abutters and subsequent notification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Filing fees for waiver applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A property owner may request a waiver from the department, under rules adopted by the department under RSA 541-A, from the provisions of this chapter to perform work not addressed under subparagraph (b) within a portion of any 100-foot buffer of a prime wetland on his or her property as provided in subparagraph (a).  At the time of the waiver request, the property owner shall notify, by certified mail, the local governing body, the planning board, if any, and the conservation commission, if any, of the municipalities in which the waiver is being sought that a waiver is being sought from the department.  Where a buffer associated with the application extends into an abutting property, the property owner requesting the waiver shall provide notice to the owner of that abutting property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any rules adopted by the commissioner defining minor projects, a series of minor projects undertaken by a single developer or several developers over a period of 5 years or less may, when considered in the aggregate, amount to a major project in the opinion of the department;  all such related projects shall be subject to a public hearing as provided in RSA 482-A:8.  A series of minor projects shall be considered in the aggregate if they abut or if they are a part of an overall scheme of development or are otherwise consistent parts of an eventual whole.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A establishing an expedited application and permitting process or permit by notification process for certain minimum impact projects.  The provisions of RSA 482-A:3, I and paragraph III of this section shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, identifying those activities within the jurisdiction of RSA 482-A that may be conducted without obtaining a permit, consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A relative to the waiver of existing standards provided for in RSA 482-A:26, III(b).  Such rules shall list the specific criteria to be used by the commissioner in determining whether a waiver will be granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the circumstances under which the commissioner may grant a waiver of rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  Such rules shall list the specific criteria to be used by the commissioner in determining whether a waiver will be granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The department shall have the authority to grant permits, in accordance with the rules adopted under RSA 482-A:11, VI for expedited application and permitting, for any projects funded through the Emergency Watershed Protection Program of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, when such projects are necessary to safeguard lives and property from floods and the products of erosion when a natural disaster is causing or has caused a sudden impairment of the watershed.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Any municipality, by its conservation commission, or, in the absence of a conservation commission, the planning board, or, in the absence of a planning board, the local governing body, may undertake to designate, map, and document prime wetlands lying within its boundaries, or if such areas lie only partly within its boundaries, then that portion lying within its boundaries.  The conservation commission, planning board, or governing body shall give written notice to the owner of the affected land and all abutters 30 days prior to the public hearing, before designating any property as prime wetlands.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prior to municipal vote under paragraph II, maps that depict wetland boundaries shall be prepared and landowners having proposed prime wetlands on their property shall be informed of the boundary delineation.  The acceptance of any prime wetland designation by the department prior to the effective date of this paragraph shall remain in effect;  however, any revision to the boundary shall be delineated using wetland delineation methods as adopted by the department and by the standards of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. For the purposes of this chapter, "prime wetlands'' shall mean any contiguous areas falling within the jurisdictional definitions of RSA 482-A:2, X and RSA 482-A:4 that, because of their size, unspoiled character, fragile condition, or other relevant factors, make them of substantial significance.  A prime wetland shall be at least 2 acres in size, shall not consist of a water body only, shall have at least 4 primary wetland functions, one of which shall be wildlife habitat, and shall have a width of at least 50 feet at its narrowest point.  The boundary of a prime wetland shall coincide, where present, with the upland edge of any wetland, as defined in RSA 482-A:2, X, that is part of the prime wetland.  On-site verification of proposed prime wetland boundaries shall be performed where landowner permission is provided.
<br>

I-b. The commissioner shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A relative to the form, criteria, and methods that shall be used to designate, map, and document prime wetlands, determine boundaries in the field, and amend maps and designations once filed and accepted by the department under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any municipal conservation commission or that local body which has mapped and designated prime wetlands in accordance with paragraph I may, after approval by any town or city council meeting, file such maps and designations with the department, which shall accept and maintain them and provide public access to such maps during regular business hours.  The procedure for acceptance by the local legislative body of any prime wetland designations as provided in paragraph I shall be the same as set forth in RSA 675:2 or RSA 675:3, as applicable.

Every petition to place fill in the bed of public waters shall be filed with the department.  The department, after 30 days' notice to abutters, to the local governing body of the municipality in which the property is situated, and to the department of health and human services, shall hold a public hearing.  Notice of the hearing shall be published twice in 2 different weeks, the last publication to be 7 days before the hearing, in one newspaper of general circulation throughout the state and another newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, and notice posted in 2 public places in the municipality, and upon appropriate investigation shall make its recommendations to the governor and council with regard to such petition.  If the department recommends that the petition be granted, in whole or in part, such recommendation shall include appropriate specifications and conditions necessary to the protection of public rights and to the protection of the rights and privileges of persons owning land in the vicinity of the area to be filled by the petitioner.  The grant of the governor and council shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing, executed by the governor and council, attested by the secretary of state, and recorded in the county where the right is to be exercised.  Land created by fill in accordance with the grant of the governor and council shall belong to the owner of the natural shoreline as if it were formed by natural accretion.  The owner of a shoreline on a public-owned water body may petition the department for the right to place fill below the artificially-created high water level of a public-owned water body to the extent that the flowage rights owned by the state allow.
