&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is hereby established the aquatic resource compensatory mitigation fund into which payments made under this subdivision shall be deposited.  The fund shall be a separate, nonlapsing fund continually appropriated to the department to be used only as specified in this subdivision for costs related to wetlands creation or restoration, stream and river restoration, stream and river enhancement, preservation of upland areas adjacent to wetlands and riparian areas, and the subsequent monitoring and maintenance of such areas.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A separate, non-lapsing account shall be established within the fund into which all administrative assessments collected under RSA 482-A:30, III and RSA 482-A:30-a, II shall be placed.  Such account moneys shall only be used to support up to 2 full-time positions for administration of the fund and related projects.  No other fund moneys shall be used for state personnel costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The state treasurer shall invest the fund as provided by law.  Interest received on such investment shall be credited to the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The wetlands council, established by RSA 21-O:5-a, shall approve disbursements of the aquatic resource compensatory mitigation fund based on recommendations provided by the site selection committee established under RSA 482-A:32, and in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner.
