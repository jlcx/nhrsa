Any notice of incompleteness sent under this subparagraph shall specify that the applicant or authorized agent shall submit such information as soon as practicable and shall notify the applicant or authorized agent that if the requested information is not received within 60 days of the notice, the department shall deny the application.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) Within 75 days of the issuance of a notice of administrative completeness for projects where the applicant proposes under one acre of jurisdictional impact and 105 days for all other projects, request any additional information that the department is permitted by law to require to complete its evaluation of the application, together with any written technical comments the department deems necessary.  Such request and technical comments may be sent by electronic means if the applicant or authorized agent has indicated an agreement to accept communications by electronic means, either by so indicating on the application or by a signed statement from the applicant or authorized agent that communicating by electronic means is acceptable.  Any request for additional information under this subparagraph shall specify that the applicant submit such information as soon as practicable and shall notify the applicant that if the requested information is not received within 60 days of the request, the department shall deny the application.

The authorization provided by this subparagraph shall not relieve the applicant of complying with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter, RSA 485-A relating to water quality, and federal requirements.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(4) Upon receipt of a written request from an applicant, the department shall issue written confirmation that the applicant has a permit by default pursuant to subparagraph (b)(3), which authorizes the applicant to proceed with the project as presented in the application and requires the work to comply with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter, and RSA 485-A relating to water quality, and federal requirements.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) If extraordinary circumstances prevent the department from conducting its normal function, time frames prescribed by this paragraph shall be suspended until such condition has ended, as determined by the commissioner.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) The time limits prescribed by this paragraph shall not apply to an application filed after the applicant has already undertaken some or all of the work covered by the application, or where the applicant has been adjudicated after final appeal, or otherwise does not contest, the department's designation as a chronic non-complier in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) Any request for a significant amendment to a pending application or an existing permit which changes the footprint of the permitted fill or dredge area shall be deemed a new application subject to the provisions of RSA 482-A:3, I and the time limits prescribed by this paragraph.  Significant amendment'' means an amendment which changes the proposed or previously approved acreage of the permitted fill or dredge area by 20 percent or more, relocates the proposed footprint of the permitted fill or dredge area, includes a prime wetland or surface waters of the state, includes a wetland of a different classification as classified by the department, or includes non-wetland areas requiring permits for filling and dredging.  This meaning of significant amendment'' shall not apply to an application amendment that is in response to a request from the department.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(f) The department may extend the time for rendering a decision under subparagraphs (a)(3)(D) and (a)(4)(D), without the applicant's agreement, on an application from an applicant who previously has been determined, after the exhaustion of available appellate remedies, to have failed to comply with this chapter or any rule adopted or permit or approval issued under this chapter, or to have misrepresented any material fact made in connection with any activity regulated or prohibited by this chapter, pursuant to an action initiated under RSA 482-A:13, RSA 482-A:14, or RSA 482-A:14-b.  The length of such an extension shall be no longer than reasonably necessary to complete the review of the application, but shall not exceed 30 days unless the applicant agrees to a longer extension.  The department shall notify the applicant of the length of the extension.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(g) The department may suspend review of an application for a proposed project on a property with respect to which the department has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for any violation of this chapter, RSA 483-B, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44, or of any rule adopted or permit or approval issued pursuant to this chapter, RSA 483-B, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44.  Any such suspension shall expire upon conclusion of the enforcement action and completion of any remedial actions the department may require to address the violation;  provided, however, that the department may resume its review of the application sooner if doing so will facilitate resolution of the violation.  The department shall resume its review of the application at the point the review was suspended, except that the department may extend any of the time limits under this paragraph and its rules up to a total of 30 days for all such extensions.  For purposes of this subparagraph, enforcement action'' means an action under RSA 482-A:13, RSA 482-A:14, RSA 482-A:14-b, RSA 483-B:18, RSA 485-A:22, RSA 485-A:42, or RSA 485-A:43.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIV-a.

Such request and technical comments may be sent by electronic means if the applicant or authorized agent has indicated an agreement to accept communications by electronic means, either by so indicating on the application or by a signed statement from the applicant or authorized agent that communicating by electronic means is acceptable.  Any request for additional information under this subparagraph shall specify that the applicant submit such information as soon as practicable and shall notify the applicant that if the requested information is not received within 60 days of the request, the department shall deny the application.

If the department fails to act within the applicable time frame established in subparagraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5), the applicant may ask the department to issue the permit by submitting a written request.  If the applicant has previously agreed to accept communications from the department by electronic means, a request submitted electronically by the applicant shall constitute a written request.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Within 14 days of the date of receipt of a written request from the applicant to issue the permit, the department shall:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The time limits prescribed by this paragraph shall not apply to an application filed after the applicant has already undertaken some or all of the work covered by the application, or where the applicant has been adjudicated after final appeal, or otherwise does not contest, the department's designation as a chronic non-complier in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The department shall notify the applicant of the length of the extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The department may suspend review of an application for a proposed project on a property with respect to which the department has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for any violation of this chapter, RSA 483-B, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44, or of any rule adopted or permit or approval issued pursuant to this chapter, RSA 483-B, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44.  Any such suspension shall expire upon conclusion of the enforcement action and completion of any remedial actions the department may require to address the violation;  provided, however, that the department may resume its review of the application sooner if doing so will facilitate resolution of the violation.  The department shall resume its review of the application at the point the review was suspended, except that the department may extend any of the time limits under this paragraph and its rules up to a total of 30 days for all such extensions.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "enforcement action'' means an action under RSA 482-A:13, RSA 482-A:14, RSA 482-A:14-b, RSA 483-B:18, RSA 485-A:22, RSA 485-A:42, or RSA 485-A:43.

Permitted impacts to aquatic resources shall be postponed until such impacts become necessary for the operation of the excavation or mining area.  If there has not been excavation or mining of construction aggregate materials and quarry stone during any 5 year period, the project shall be deemed abandoned and the permit deemed expired.  When or if a new proposal to develop the property for a different use is proposed, a new application shall be submitted.
<br>
