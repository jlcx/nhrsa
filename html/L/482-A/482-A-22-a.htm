<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Removing the submerged logs will have minimal or no adverse environmental impact, based on considerations including whether the logs were treated with hazardous or toxic chemicals and whether the logs are providing important aquatic habitat as determined by the department of fish and game;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The submerged logs to be removed are interfering with navigation or otherwise adversely affecting public safety or the environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The application filed pursuant to paragraph II shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Identify the manner in which the logs will be removed, the measures to be taken to minimize any adverse environmental impact, and the formula by which the net proceeds of the use or sale of the removed logs will be determined;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Include the results of such testing as the department may require to determine the environmental impact of the logs in place and of removing the logs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A municipality that receives a permit under this section may enter into a commercially reasonable private contract to undertake the log removal after publicly requesting bids for such work.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The net proceeds of any use or sale of the removed logs shall accrue directly to the benefit of the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The municipality shall hold a public hearing on the application in conjunction with the department.  The municipality shall send direct notice of the application and the public hearing to the department of fish and game and to each person owning land within 150 feet of the area from which the logs will be removed.  The municipality also shall post notice of the hearing in 2 public places in the municipality, one of which may be the municipality's website, and shall publish notice of the hearing twice in 2 different weeks, the last publication to be 7 days before the hearing, in one newspaper of general circulation throughout the state and another newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.  The department shall post notice of the hearing and of the deadline for submission of written comments on the department's website, which deadline shall be not less than 10 days following the public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. After appropriate consideration of the application and any comments received, the department shall make its recommendations to the governor and council with regard to such petition.  If the department recommends that the petition be granted, in whole or in part, such recommendation shall include appropriate specifications and conditions necessary to protect public rights and the rights and privileges of persons owning land within 150 feet of the area from which the logs will be removed, which shall include requirements for testing the submerged logs prior to and during removal to determine proper handling and disposal.
