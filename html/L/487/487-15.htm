&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 487:15 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The general court recognizes that rapidly escalating pressures of shorefront development and recreational uses of public waters have placed increasing strains upon the state's lake resources, thereby accelerating the eutrophication process in many of our public lakes through nuisance growths of aquatic macrophyton and phytoplankton (algae) and thus posing a threat to water quality.  The general court further recognizes the need to restore, preserve and maintain the state's lakes and ponds in order that these significant environmental, aesthetic and recreational assets will continue to benefit the social and economic well-being of the state's citizens.

The general court recognizes that rapidly escalating pressures of shorefront development and recreational uses of public waters have placed increasing strains upon the state's lake resources, thereby accelerating the eutrophicationprocess in many of our public lakes through nuisance growths of aquatic macrophytes (aquatic plants) and phytoplankton (algae) and thus posing a threat to water quality.  The general court further recognizes that transporting boats from one water body to another increases the risk of inadvertent transport of aquatic nuisance species, some of which are invisible to the unaided eye.  This risk can be reduced by inspecting and draining all boats and water-related equipment upon leaving state waters.  The general court further recognizes the need to restore, preserve and maintain the state's lakes and ponds in order that these significant environmental, aesthetic and recreational assets will continue to benefit the social and economic well-being of the state's citizens.
