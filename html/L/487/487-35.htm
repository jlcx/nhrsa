&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 487:35 Finding of Public Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that it is for the public good and welfare of this state to protect and preserve its tidal waters for propagation and harvest of shellfish and for other beneficial uses.  Shellfish propagation and harvest is a primary indicator of the overall ecological and water quality health of coastal waters.  As such, the general court further recognizes the need to restore, preserve, and maintain the state's tidal waters in order that these significant environmental, aesthetic, and recreational assets will continue to benefit the social and economic well-being of the state's citizens.
