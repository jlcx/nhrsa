<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established within the department of environmental services the New Hampshire healthy tidal waters and shellfish protection program.  This program ensures that water quality in coastal waters supports the propagation, conservation, and harvest of shellfish.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To the extent that funds are available, the department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Exercise and administer the classification of coastal waters under New Hampshire shellfish sanitation control authority, pursuant to RSA 143:21 and RSA 143:21-a, so that all waters suitable for shellfish propagation and harvest are classified, and, to the maximum extent possible, classified areas are approved for harvest of shellfish, in accordance with the National Shellfish Sanitation Program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Identify impaired water quality for shellfish harvesting and work with cooperating agencies and the public to mitigate impairments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Educate citizens about the need for watershed stewardship to keep coastal waters clean for harvest of shellfish and other designated uses that depend upon safe and clean water.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Conduct strategic planning, together with cooperating agencies and organizations, for New Hampshire's shellfish program, to enhance recreational shellfish harvest and establish commercial aquaculture harvest potential.
