&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 486:13 Disposal of Septage. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
To insure the efficient collection and disposal of material pumped from or otherwise removed from septic tanks or other sewage storage facilities, referred to in this section as "septage,'' the department is authorized and directed to require the installation and operation of a septage reception and treatment facility in conjunction with any pollution abatement project for which state or federal aid is allocated pursuant to the provisions of RSA 486 and PL 92-500 (or subsequent amendments thereto), respectively.  The incorporation of septage reception and treatment facilities as provided in this section shall not be applied retroactively but rather shall apply to projects constructed after January 1, 1990.  The department is further authorized to review and approve proposed charges to be levied by municipalities for said reception and treatment of septage.  The purpose of such review is to assure that the proposed service charges are equitable to all parties concerned and in no case shall municipalities be required to provide service at a financial loss.  Additionally, municipalities shall not be required to receive and treat septage in such amount or at such times as would interfere with proper operation of municipal treatment and disposal facilities.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or modify in any way the authority conferred upon the department of health and human services under the provisions of RSA 147, in connection with public dumping facilities or removal, transportation and disposal of putrescible material.
