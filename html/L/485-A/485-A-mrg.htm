&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:3 Policies. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative intent, that the department shall, in the administration and enforcement of this chapter, strive to provide that all sources of pollution within the state shall be abated within such times and to such degrees as shall be required to satisfy the provisions of state law or applicable federal law, whichever is more stringent.  To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing nor the aims of any joint state-federal permit program that may from time to time be agreed upon and in force pursuant to this chapter and applicable federal law, the department shall adhere to the following policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Insofar as practicable, the initial objective of the control program will be to obtain the installation of primary treatment (with adequate disinfection where sewage discharges are involved) for all discharges of sewage and industrial wastes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The second objective will be to require the installation of secondary treatment whenever such additional treatment is necessary to protect the uses assigned to the particular stream classification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The third objective, after all stream classification requirements throughout the state have been satisfied, will be to continue the program of pollution abatement by installing other forms of treatment desirable to maintain all surface waters of the state in as clean a condition as possible, consistent with available assistance funds and technological developments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Until such time as appropriate methodology and reasonable levels of financial assistance are made available, municipalities with combined sewer systems shall not be required to provide treatment facilities with capacity greater than that necessary to handle anticipated peak dry weather flows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A further objective will be to advance the development and application of innovative/alternative waste treatment systems with guidelines, procedures, pilot projects, demonstration projects, community projects or in any other manner the department may elect.

<center><h3>Section 485-A:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:8 Standards for Classification of Surface Waters of the State. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It shall be the overall goal that all surface waters attain and maintain specified standards of water quality to achieve the purposes of the legislative classification.  For purposes of classification there shall be 2 classes or grades of surface waters as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Class A waters shall be of the highest quality and shall contain not more than either a geometric mean based on at least 3 samples obtained over a 60-day period of 47 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters, or greater than 153 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters in any one sample;  and for designated beach areas shall contain not more than a geometric mean based on at least 3 samples obtained over a 60-day period of 47 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters, or 88 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters in any one sample;  unless naturally occurring.  There shall be no discharge of any sewage or wastes into waters of this classification.  The waters of this classification shall be considered as being potentially acceptable for water supply uses after adequate treatment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Class B waters shall be of the second highest quality and shall have no objectionable physical characteristics, shall contain a dissolved oxygen content of at least 75 percent of saturation, and shall contain not more than either a geometric mean based on at least 3 samples obtained over a 60-day period of 126 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters, or greater than 406 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters in any one sample;  and for designated beach areas shall contain not more than a geometric mean based on at least 3 samples obtained over a 60-day period of 47 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters, or 88 Escherichia coli per 100 milliliters in any one sample;  unless naturally occurring.  There shall be no disposal of sewage or waste into said waters except those which have received adequate treatment to prevent the lowering of the biological, physical, chemical or bacteriological characteristics below those given above, nor shall such disposal of sewage or waste be inimical to aquatic life or to the maintenance of aquatic life in said receiving waters.  The pH range for said waters shall be 6.5 to 8.0 except when due to natural causes.  Any stream temperature increase associated with the discharge of treated sewage, waste or cooling water, water diversions, or releases shall not be such as to appreciably interfere with the uses assigned to this class.  The waters of this classification shall be considered as being acceptable for fishing, swimming and other recreational purposes and, after adequate treatment, for use as water supplies.  Where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department that the class B criteria cannot reasonably be met in certain surface waters at all times as a result of combined sewer overflow events, temporary partial use areas shall be established by rules adopted under RSA 485-A:6, XI-c, which meet, as a minimum, the standards specified in paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The waters in temporary partial use areas established under paragraph II shall be free from slick, odors, turbidity, sludge deposits, and surface-floating solids of unreasonable kind or quantity, shall contain not less than 5 parts per million of dissolved oxygen;  shall have a hydrogen ion concentration within the range of pH 6.0 to 9.0 except when due to natural causes;  and shall be free from chemicals and other materials and conditions inimical to aquatic life or the maintenance of aquatic life.  These criteria shall apply during combined sewer overflow discharges and up to 3 days following cessation of said discharge.  At all other times the standards and uses specified in paragraph II shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, the department in submitting classifications relating to interstate waters to the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission for review and approval, as provided for under the terms of Article V of the compact whereby the interstate commission was created by RSA 484, shall submit such classifications in accordance with the standards of water quality as currently adopted by said interstate water pollution control commission provided, however, that the standards for any classification thus submitted for review and approval shall not be less than, nor exceed the standards of the classification duly adopted by the General Court as provided for in RSA 485-A:9 or 10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Tidal waters utilized for swimming purposes shall contain not more than either a geometric mean based on at least 3 samples obtained over a 60-day period of 35 enterococci per 100 milliliters, or 104 enterococci per 100 milliliters in any one sample, unless naturally occurring.  Those tidal waters used for growing or taking of shellfish for human consumption shall, in addition to the foregoing requirements, be in accordance with the criteria recommended under the National Shellfish Program Manual of Operation, United States Department of Food and Drug Administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, the commissioner shall have the authority to adopt such stream classification criteria as may be issued from time to time by the federal Environmental Protection Agency or its successor agency insofar as said criteria may relate to the water uses specified in RSA 485-A:8, I and II, provided, however, that the criteria thus issued shall not result in standards that are less than nor exceed the standards of the classification duly enacted by the general court as provided for in RSA 485-A:9 or 485-A:10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. All tests and sampling for the purposes of examination of waters shall be performed and carried out in a reasonable manner and whenever practicable, in accordance with the commonly accepted scientific method as selected by the department.  The waters in each classification shall satisfy all the provisions of all lower classifications.  The minimum treatment for the lowest classification shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For sewage, secondary treatment and disinfection as necessary to comply with water quality standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For industrial wastes and combined sewer overflows, such treatment as the department shall determine.  Appeal from any such determination shall be in the manner provided for in RSA 21-O:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In prescribing minimum treatment provisions for thermal wastes discharged to interstate waters, the department shall adhere to the water quality requirements and recommendations of the New Hampshire fish and game department, the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, or the United States Environmental Protection Agency, whichever requirements and recommendations provide the most effective level of thermal pollution control.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Subject to the provisions of RSA 485-A:13, I(a), the fish and game department may use rotenone or similar compounds in the conduct of its program to reclaim the public waters of the state for game fishing.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After adoption of a given classification for a stream, lake, pond, tidal water, or section of such water, the department shall enforce such classification by appropriate action in the courts of the state, and it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to dispose of any sewage, industrial, or other wastes, either alone or in conjunction with any other person or persons, in such a manner as will lower the quality of the waters of the stream, lake, pond, tidal water, or section of such water below the minimum requirements of the adopted classification.  If the department shall set a time limit for abatement of pollution under paragraph II, and it becomes apparent at any time during the compliance period that full compliance with the adopted classification will not be attained by the end of such period due to the failure of any person to take action reasonably calculated to secure abatement of the pollution within the time specified, the department shall notify such person or persons in writing.  If such person or persons shall fail or neglect to take appropriate steps to comply with the classification requirements within a period of 30 days after such notice, the department shall seek appropriate action in the courts of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If, after adoption of a classification of any stream, lake, pond, or tidal water, or section of such water, including those classified by RSA 485-A:11, it is found that there is a source or sources of pollution which lower the quality of the waters in question below the minimum requirements of the classification so established, the person or persons responsible for the discharging of such pollution shall be required to abate such pollution within a time to be fixed by the department.  If such pollution is of municipal or industrial origin, the time limit set by the department for such abatement shall be not less than 2 years nor more than 5 years.  For good cause shown, the department may from time to time extend any time limit established under this paragraph.  Any determination by the department under this paragraph shall be subject to appeal as provided for in RSA 485-A:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No activity, including construction and operation of facilities, that requires certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act and that may result in a discharge, as that term is applied under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, to surface waters of the state may commence unless the department certifies that any such discharge complies with the state surface water quality standards applicable to the classification for the receiving surface water body.  The department shall provide its response to a request for certification to the federal agency or authority responsible for issuing the license, permit, or registration that requires the certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act.  Certification shall include any conditions on, modifications to, or monitoring of the proposed activity necessary to provide assurance that the proposed discharge complies with applicable surface water quality standards.  The department may enforce compliance with any such conditions, modifications, or monitoring requirements as provided in RSA 485-A:22.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No activity that involves surface water withdrawal or diversion of surface water that requires registration under RSA 488:3, that does not otherwise require the certification required under paragraph III, and which was not in active operation as of the effective date of this paragraph, may commence unless the department certifies that the surface water withdrawal or diversion of surface water complies with state surface water quality standards applicable to the classification for the surface water body.  The certification shall include any conditions on, modifications to, or monitoring of the proposed activity necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the proposed activity complies with applicable surface water quality standards.  The department may enforce compliance with any such conditions, modifications, or monitoring requirements as provided in RSA 485-A:22.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to discharge or dispose of any sewage or waste to the surface water or groundwater of the state without first obtaining a written permit from the department of environmental services.  Applications for permits shall be made upon forms prescribed by the department of environmental services and shall contain such relevant information as the department of environmental services may require.  The department of environmental services shall include in such permits effluent limitations, which may be based upon economic and technological factors, upon the classification enacted by the legislature, upon the projected best use of the surface water downstream or upon the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended from time to time, and all regulations, guidelines and standards promulgated thereunder, whichever provides the most effective means to abate pollution.  The department of environmental services may also prescribe such other reasonable conditions as may be necessary or desirable in order to fulfill the purpose of this chapter or applicable federal law.  Such permits may contain, in the case of sources not in compliance with such effluent limitations at the time the permit is issued, compliance schedules, including interim requirements necessary or desirable in order to fulfill the purposes or requirements of this chapter, and any such compliance schedules may be imposed without regard to the time limits for abatement of pollution referred to in RSA 485-A:12, II and shall be consistent with the purposes and requirements of applicable federal law.  The department of environmental services may prescribe a monitoring program to be performed by the applicant with periodic reports to the department of environmental services, including, where appropriate in terms of the nature of the effluent, continuous monitoring.  Permits shall be issued for a fixed term, not to exceed 5 years.  The department of environmental services may revise, modify or suspend in whole or in part or terminate any permit, following hearing, upon a finding that just cause exists for such action.  Further, whenever in its judgment the purposes of this chapter will be best served, the department of environmental services may require as a condition to the granting of such permits that either the ownership and operation of the collection and treatment facilities involved be vested in the municipality or any subdivision thereof in which the system is located, if said municipality by legal action agrees thereto, or such other reasonable conditions as will ensure continuous and continuing operation and maintenance of the facilities.  No permit shall be granted to utilize the entire assets of the surface water, or in any other case in which the department of environmental services determines that the grant of a permit would be inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter.  Any determination by the department of environmental services under this paragraph shall be subject to appeal as provided for in RSA 485-A:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no permit to discharge sewage or waste shall be issued authorizing any of the following discharges:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The discharge of any radiological, chemical or biological warfare agent or high level radioactive waste.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any discharge into navigable waters which the secretary of the army of the United States acting through the chief of engineers determines would substantially impair anchorage and navigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any discharge to which the regional administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or his successor in jurisdiction, has objected in writing pursuant to any right to object each provided such official in section 402(d) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended from time to time;  provided, that this subparagraph and subparagraph (2) above shall not preclude the department of environmental services or any other person from availing itself of the judicial review of any such objection, or any determination by the secretary of the army, available under applicable federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Any discharge from a point source which is in conflict with a plan or amendment to such plan approved pursuant to section 208(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended from time to time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any person responsible for a bypass or upset at a wastewater facility shall give immediate notice of the bypass or upset to all public or privately owned water systems drawing water from the same receiving water and located within 20 miles downstream of the point of discharge.  The permittee shall maintain a list of persons, and their telephone numbers, who are to be notified immediately by telephone.  In addition, written notification, which shall be postmarked within 3 days of the bypass or upset, shall be sent to such persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. On application of the department of environmental services, the superior court or any justice of such court, in term time, or in vacation may enjoin any act in violation of any lawful order of the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the interim between the effective date of classification legislation hereafter enacted affecting any surface water of the state or section of such water, and the time limit for abatement of pollution set thereafter either by the department of environmental services under RSA 485-A:12, II or by the legislature, it shall be unlawful for person or persons to dispose of any sewage or waste into said surface water of the state in excess of the maximum quantity or of a different character, than that being disposed of during the period of one year prior to the effective date of such legislative classification without first obtaining written permission from the department of environmental services.

Petroleum-powered vehicles include, but are not limited to, cars, trucks, motorcycles, snowmobiles, motorized boats, off highway recreational vehicles, all terrain vehicles, construction equipment, trains, and airplanes.  Petroleum containers include, but are not limited to, drums, barrels, tanks, pails, cans, jugs, or equipment which contains oil.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The lawful owner of the submerged vehicle or container shall notify the department of environmental services in accordance with RSA 146-A, and the department shall investigate any possible contamination and ensure the safe removal of the vehicle or container from the body of water involved.  Any partially or completely submerged vehicle or petroleum container shall be presumed to be discharging oil into the surface waters of the state and shall be subject to the reporting, removal, and strict liability requirements of RSA 146-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The lawful owner of a vehicle shall notify the department of safety, division of state police, if any person is injured or killed in an incident involving a submerged vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the owner refuses or fails to remove a submerged vehicle or container as required by paragraph I, or if no owner can be identified, the department of environmental services may contract for the removal of the vehicle or container in question.  The owner of the submerged vehicle or container shall be strictly liable for the costs of removing the vehicle or container and the costs of the investigation, containment, cleanup, removal, and corrective measures associated with the discharge.  The cost shall be recoverable by the state in an action of debt brought by the attorney general in the name of the state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Any person who fails to remove a submerged or partially submerged vehicle or container, as required by paragraph I, shall be guilty of a violation.  Agents of the department of safety, division of state police, or any police officer of the municipality in which the vehicle or container is submerged may issue citations for a violation of this section and issue fines of $500 for each day the vehicle remains in the water.  No citation or fine so issued shall preclude the department of environmental services from taking action pursuant to subparagraph (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The department of environmental services may take action against any person who fails to remove a submerged or partially submerged vehicle or container, as required by paragraph I, in accordance with RSA 485-A:22.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:17 Terrain Alteration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person proposing to dredge, excavate, place fill, mine, transport forest products or undertake construction in or on the border of the surface waters of the state, and any person proposing to significantly alter the characteristics of the terrain, in such a manner as to impede the natural runoff or create an unnatural runoff, shall be directly responsible to submit to the department detailed plans concerning such proposal and any additional relevant information requested by the department, at least 30 days prior to undertaking any such activity.  The operations shall not be undertaken unless and until the applicant receives a permit from the department.  The department shall have full authority to establish the terms and conditions under which any permit issued may be exercised, giving due consideration to the circumstances involved and the purposes of this chapter, and to adopt such rules as are reasonably related to the efficient administration of this section, and the purposes of this chapter.  Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to modify or limit the duties and authority conferred upon the department under RSA 482 and RSA 482-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall charge a fee for each review of plans, including project inspections, required under this section.  The fee shall be based on the extent of contiguous area to be disturbed.  Except for RSA 483-B:9, the fee for plans encompassing an area of at least 100,000 square feet but less than 200,000 square feet shall be $1,250.  For the purposes of RSA 483-B:9, the fee for plans encompassing an area of at least 50,000 square feet but less than 200,000 square feet shall be $1,250.  An additional fee of $500 shall be assessed for each additional area of up to 100,000 square feet to be disturbed.  No permit shall be issued by the department until the fee required by this paragraph is paid.  All fees required under this paragraph shall be paid when plans are submitted for review and shall be deposited in the terrain alteration fund established in paragraph II-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. There is hereby established the terrain alteration fund into which the fees collected under paragraph II shall be deposited.  The fund shall be a separate, nonlapsing fund, continually appropriated to the department for the purpose of paying all costs and salaries associated with the terrain alteration program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-b. In processing an application for permits under RSA 485-A:17:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Within 50 days of receipt of the application, the department shall request any additional information required to complete its evaluation of the application, together with any written technical comments the department deems necessary.  Any request for additional information shall specify that the applicant submit such information as soon as practicable and shall notify the applicant that if all of the requested information is not received within 120 days of the request, the department shall deny the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the department requests additional information pursuant to subparagraph (a), the department shall, within 30 days of the department's receipt of the information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Approve the application in whole or in part and issue a permit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Extend the time for rendering a decision on the application for good cause and with the written agreement of the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If no request for additional information is made pursuant to subparagraph (b), the department shall, within 50 days of receipt of the application:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Approve the application, in whole or in part and issue a permit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Deny the application, and issue written findings in support of the denial;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Extend the time for rendering a decision on the application for good cause and with the written agreement of the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) The time limits prescribed by this paragraph shall supersede any time limits provided in any other provision of law.  If the department fails to act within the applicable time frame established in subparagraphs (b) and (c), the applicant may ask the department to issue the permit by submitting a written request.  If the applicant has previously agreed to accept communications from the department by electronic means, a request submitted electronically by the applicant shall constitute a written request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Within 14 days of the date of receipt of a written request from the applicant to issue the permit, the department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Approve the application, in whole or in part, and issue a permit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Deny the application and issue written findings in support of the denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the department does not issue either a permit or a written denial within the 14-day period, the applicant shall be deemed to have a permit by default and may proceed with the project as presented in the application.  The authorization provided by this subparagraph shall not relieve the applicant of complying with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this section and RSA 485-A relating to water quality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Upon receipt of a written request from an applicant, the department shall issue written confirmation that the applicant has a permit by default pursuant to subparagraph (d)(3), which authorizes the applicant to proceed with the project as presented in the application and requires the work to comply with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this section and RSA 485-A relating to water quality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The time limits under this paragraph shall not apply to an application from an applicant that has previously been found in violation of this chapter pursuant to RSA 485-A:22-a or an application that does not otherwise comply with the department's rules relative to the permit application process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The department may extend the time for rendering a decision under subparagraphs (b)(3) and (c)(3), without the applicant's agreement, on an application from an applicant who previously has been determined, after the exhaustion of available appellate remedies, to have failed to comply with this section or any rule adopted or permit or approval issued under this section, or to have misrepresented any material fact made in connection with any activity regulated or prohibited by this section, pursuant to an action initiated under RSA 485-A:22.  The length of such an extension shall be no longer than reasonably necessary to complete the review of the application, and shall not exceed 30 days unless the applicant agrees to a longer extension.  The department shall notify the applicant of the length of the extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The department may suspend review of an application for a proposed project on a property with respect to which the department has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for any violation of this section, RSA 482-A, RSA 483-B, or RSA 485-A:29-44, or of any rule adopted or permit or approval issued pursuant to this section, RSA 482-A, RSA 483-B, or RSA 485-A:29-44.  Any such suspension shall expire upon conclusion of the enforcement action and completion of any remedial actions the department may require to address the violation;  provided, however, that the department may resume its review of the application sooner if doing so will facilitate resolution of the violation.  The department shall resume its review of the application at the point the review was suspended, except that the department may extend any of the time limits under this paragraph and its rules up to a total of 30 days for all such extensions.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "enforcement action'' means an action initiated under RSA 482-A:13, RSA 482-A:14, RSA 482-A:14-b, RSA 483-B:18, RSA 485-A:22, RSA 485-A:42, or RSA 485-A:43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-c. Beginning October 1, 2007 and each fiscal quarter thereafter, the department shall submit a quarterly report to the house and senate finance committees, the house resources, recreation, and economic development committee, and the senate energy, environment, and economic development committee relative to administration of the terrain alteration review program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-d. All permits issued, except for projects covered by paragraph II-e, pursuant to this section shall be valid for a period of 5 years.  Requests for extensions of such permits may be made to the department.  The department shall grant an extension of up to 5 additional years, provided the applicant demonstrates all of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The permit for which extension is sought has not expired prior to the date on which a written extension request from the permittee is received by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The permit for which extension is sought has not been revoked or suspended without reinstatement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Extension would not violate a condition of statute or rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Surface water quality will continue to be protected as under the original permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The project is proceeding towards completion in accordance with plans and other documentation referenced by the permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If applicable, any inspection reports have been completed and submitted as required by the permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The permit has not previously been extended, unless the subdivision plat or site plan associated with the permit has been deemed substantially complete by the governing municipal planning board in accordance with RSA 674:39, II, in which case subsequent extensions of the permit are allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-e. A permit issued under this section that is associated with the ongoing excavation or mining of materials from the earth shall not expire for the life of the project identified in the permit application, provided that the permit holder submits a written update of the project's status every 5 years from the date of the permit issuance using a form obtained from the department as specified in department rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Normal agricultural operations shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Timber harvesting operations shall be exempt from the fee provisions of this section.  Timber harvesting operations shall be considered in compliance with this section and shall be issued a permit by rule provided such operations are in accordance with procedures prescribed in the Best Management Practices for Erosion Control on Timber Harvesting Operations in New Hampshire, published by the department of resources and economic development, and provided that the department of revenue administration's intent to cut form is signed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Trail construction operations for the purposes of modifying existing biking and walking trails shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.

I. Any person proposing either to subdivide land, except as provided in RSA 485-A:33, or to construct a sewage or waste disposal system, shall submit 2 copies of such locally approved plans as are required by the local planning board or other local body having authority for the approval of any such subdivision of land, which is subject to department approval, and 2 copies of plans and specifications for any sewage or waste disposal systems which will be constructed on any subdivision or lot for approval in accordance with the requirements of the department as provided in this paragraph.  In the event that such subdivision plans which receive final local approval differ from the plans which are reviewed by the department, the person proposing the subdivision shall resubmit those plans to the department for reapproval.  The planning board or other local body having final local approval authority shall submit one copy of such plans which receive final local approval to the department for informational purposes within 30 days of granting such final approval.  The department shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the submission of plans and specifications as necessary to effect the purposes of this subdivision.  The rules shall specify when and where the plans and specifications are to be submitted, what details, data and information are to be contained in the plans and specifications, including the location of known burial sites or cemeteries within or adjacent to the property on which the proposed sewage or waste disposal system is to be located, what tests are to be required, what standards, guidelines, procedures, and criteria are to be applied and followed in constructing any sewage or waste disposal system, and other related matters.  The rules shall also establish the methodology and review process for approval of innovative/alternative wastewater treatment systems and for approval of a plan for operation, maintenance, and financial responsibility for such operations.  For any part or parts of the subdivisions where construction or waste disposal is not contemplated, only the lot lines, property boundaries drawn to scale, and general soil and related data shall be required.  The constructed sewage or waste disposal systems shall be in strict accordance with approved plans, and the facilities shall not be covered or placed in operation without final inspection and approval by an authorized agent of the department.  All inspections by the department shall be accomplished within 7 business days after receipt of written notification from the builder that the system is ready for inspection.  Plans and specifications need not be submitted for subdivision approval for subdivisions consisting of the division of a tract or parcel of land exclusively in lots of 5 or more acres in area.  The presence of hydric soils on lots of 5 or more acres in area shall be insufficient, without additional supporting data, to classify these lots as wetlands, or to make such lots unsuitable for sewage or waste disposal systems designed for poorly drained soils.  This exemption in no way relieves any person from responsibility for obtaining approval under this chapter for construction of individual or other sewage or waste disposal systems or both in any exempted lots.  In such cases, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide to the lot purchasers satisfactory assurance as the purchasers may require at the time of sale that lots sold shall be adequate to support individual sewage or waste disposal systems or both in accordance with rules adopted by the department and the requirements of this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Permitted designers of subsurface sewage disposal systems shall obtain the registry of deeds volume and page numbers for each lot that relates to the septic system application and provide them to the department.  The department shall develop and approve an outline of brief instructions for the periodic maintenance, care and proper usage of waste disposal systems, including a warning of the potential public health hazard and pollution of public and private water supplies and surface water of the state from improperly maintained sewage and waste disposal systems.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All lots on which wastewater is or will be disposed on-site and all lots on which a private well serving a public water system exists or will be installed, including lots created prior to August 20, 1989, shall be subject to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Rules adopted under this section concerning such lots shall include provisions allowing abutting lot owners to overlap their respective well radii for their mutual benefit and provisions allowing well radii to extend over property lines onto state and locally-mandated property line setbacks, recorded easements, or land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph I(b) effective until September 11, 2015;  see also paragraph I(b) set out below.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For private wells serving commercial buildings, the entire protective well radius shall be maintained on one or more of the following:  on-log, on a recorded easement, on land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development, or on state and locally mandated property line setbacks.  For the purposes of this section, the term "commercial building'' shall not include a residence which is also used for commercial purposes unless the total water withdrawal exceeds 600 gallons per day.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph I(b) effective September 11, 2015;  see also paragraph I(b) set out above.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) For any private well being installed or utilized to serve one or more new commercial buildings or a non-community public water system, the entire protective well radius shall be located on one or more of the following:  on-lot, on a recorded easement, on land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development, or on state or locally mandated property line setbacks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A private well may be installed without being located as required by subparagraph (1) only if it is needed to replace a well serving one or more existing commercial buildings or a public water system, there will be no increase in water use to a level that requires a larger protective well radius under rules adopted by the department, and the lot is not part of a larger parcel that is being subdivided.  In such cases, the on-lot protective radius shall be maximized to the extent practicable and the owner of the property shall sign a standard release form prepared by the department, upon which the actual protective radius shall be noted together with a narrative description of the location of the well, to acknowledge the potential loss of the protection of any portion of the radius which extends over the property line.  The owner shall record the release form in the registry of deeds and shall file a copy of the recorded release form with the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If a private well installed under the provisions of subparagraph (2) is not regulated as a public water supply well under RSA 485, the department shall require such water quality monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting as is needed to ensure the water is suitable for its intended uses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) For the purposes of this section, the term "commercial building'' means a building that houses a commercial use but shall not include a residence which is also used for commercial purposes unless the total water withdrawal exceeds 600 gallons per day.  A new commercial building means a new structure intended for commercial use, an existing residential structure being converted to commercial use, or an increase in water use at an existing commercial building to a level that requires a larger protective well radius under rules adopted by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For private wells serving buildings other than commercial buildings, if the protective well radius cannot be wholly maintained on an existing lot of record due to the size or other physical characteristics of the lot, then the on-lot protective radius shall be maximized to the extent practicable.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, the protective well radius shall be maintained on one or more of the following:  on-lot, on a recorded easement, on land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development, or on state and locally mandated property line setbacks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any person submitting plans and specifications for a sewage or waste disposal system for a property which is or will be served by an on-lot well, shall show the location or proposed location of the well, or a designated area within which the well will be located, on such plans and shall show the protective radius as specified in the department's rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whenever the department approves a septic plan with an on-lot well radius which is less than the optimum standard, the department shall notify the applicant of the consequences of such reduced radius and advise the applicant whether special precautions should be taken relative to well installation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the well is not installed prior to the sewage or waste disposal system being constructed, then the property owner shall provide the water well contractor with a copy of the approved plan showing the location of the well, and the water well contractor shall ensure, to the best of his ability that the well is installed in accordance with the approved plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) When, for reasons of the condition of the lot or the placement of buildings thereon, the well cannot be installed as shown on the approved plan, the water well contractor shall advise and consult with the property owner, or the property owner's agent, on the best possible alternative location, considering distance to property boundaries and to the sewage or waste disposal system.  Using a standard release form prepared by the department, the water well contractor shall alert the owner to the consequences of the alternate installation, including the potential loss of the protection of any portion of the radius which extends over the property line.  The owner, or the owner's agent, may defer to the designer of the sewage or waste disposal system or may allow the water well contractor to proceed in the identified alternative location.  Prior to installing the well in the identified alternative location, the well contractor shall, using the standard release form, obtain a written acknowledgment, from the property owner, or the owner's agent, that the consequences are understood.  The designer shall prepare an amended plan showing the actual location of the well.  The property owner shall forward the amended plan, together with a copy of the signed release form, to the department and the local code enforcement officer or other appropriate designated local official prior to using the well.  If the on-lot protective well radius is less than the optimum prescribed standard, the owner shall record the release form, upon which the actual protective radius shall be noted, together with a narrative description of the location of the well in the registry of deeds, and a copy of the recorded release form shall be filed with the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For lots approved under RSA 485-A:29, the rules adopted under this section concerning such lots shall include provisions allowing abutting lot owners to overlap their respective well radii for their mutual benefit by allowing well radii to extend over property lines, onto state and locally mandated property line setbacks, recorded easements, or land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development.  If after a lot is created pursuant to this section, the well cannot be installed as shown on the subdivision plan, then the provisions of RSA 485-A:30-b, I(d), (e), (f), and (g) shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "cluster development'' means a form of residential subdivision that permits dwelling units to be grouped on sites or lots with dimensions, frontages, and setbacks reduced from conventional requirements, provided that the remaining land area is permanently designated as open space for cluster development.  For cluster developments the following provisions shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Where the sewage waste disposal systems are located off of the individual home lots or the cluster development is served by municipal sewers, the wells and associated protective radii serving those home lots need not be confined to the individual lot which each well serves so long as all wells and their associated protective radii are confined within the tract of home lots and common land permanently designated as open space, and shall not encumber property situated outside of the cluster development except by recorded easement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Where the home lots are serviced by on-lot sewage or waste disposal systems, wells and their protective radii may be located wholly or partially on common land permanently designated as open space, and shall not encumber adjacent lots or property situated outside of the cluster development except by recorded easement.  The department shall not approve such off-lot wells and radii unless the lot owner or developer demonstrates to the department's satisfaction, by means of recorded easements, land use restrictions or other appropriate mechanisms, that the well owner will be able to maintain and service the well in perpetuity and that the area covered by the protective well radius is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A providing for protective well radii for private water wells, and for regulation of land use within the radii boundary.

Unless such written disapproval shall be mailed to the person submitting plans and specifications within 30 days in the case of plans and specifications for subdivision of land and 15 working days in the case of plans and specifications for sewage or waste disposal systems from the date of receipt with the required fees by the department, the plans and specifications shall be deemed to have been approved.  The department shall send a copy of the approval or disapproval of such plans and specifications to the planning board or board of selectmen of the affected municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department may extend the time for rendering a decision under paragraph I, without the applicant's agreement, on an application from an applicant who previously has been determined, after the exhaustion of available appellate remedies, to have failed to comply with RSA 485-A:29-44, or any rule adopted or permit or approval issued pursuant to RSA 485-A:29-44, or to have misrepresented any material fact made in connection with any activity regulated or prohibited by RSA 485-A:29-44, pursuant to an action initiated under RSA 485-A:42 or RSA 485-A:43.  The length of such an extension shall be no longer than reasonably necessary to complete the review of the application and shall not exceed 30 days unless the applicant agrees to a longer extension.  The department shall notify the applicant of the length of the extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department may suspend a review of an application for a proposed project on a property with respect to which the department has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for any violation of RSA 485-A:29-44;  RSA 482-A;  RSA 483-B;  or RSA 485-A:17, or of any rule adopted or permit or approval issued pursuant to RSA 485-A:29-44;  RSA 482-A;  RSA 483-B;  or RSA 485-A:17.  Any such suspension shall expire upon conclusion of the enforcement action and completion of any remedial actions the department may require to address the violation;  provided, however, that the department may resume its review of the application sooner if doing so will facilitate resolution of the violation.  The department shall resume its review of the application at the point the review was suspended, except that the department may extend any of the time limits under this paragraph and its rules up to a total of 30 days for all such extensions.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "enforcement action'' means an action initiated under RSA 482-A:13;  RSA 482-A:14;  RSA 482-A:14-b;  RSA 483-B:18;  RSA 485-A:22;  RSA 485-A:42;  or RSA 485-A:43.

Any permitted installer who is also a permitted designer under RSA 485-A:35 may fulfill the continuing education requirements for both permits with the same approved 6 hours of continuing education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A permitted installer who fails to file a complete application for renewal, the biennial permit fee, and documentation that the required continuing education has been completed with the department prior to the expiration of the permit shall pay an additional late renewal fee of $80 with the renewal application, biennial permit fee, and documentation, provided the fees, renewal application, and documentation are filed with the department within 30 days of the permit expiration date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the renewal application, biennial permit fee, late renewal fee, and documentation are not filed within 30 days of the permit expiration date, the permit shall be deemed suspended.  The permit holder may request reinstatement of the permit within 60 days of the suspension by submitting a complete application for renewal, the biennial permit fee specified in subparagraph (a), the late renewal fee specified in subparagraph (c), documentation that the required continuing education has been completed, and a reinstatement fee of $80.  If the individual does not request reinstatement within 60 days of the suspension, the permit shall be deemed void.  Any individual whose permit has become void who wishes to obtain an installer's permit shall apply as for a new permit pursuant to subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) No individual whose permit has been suspended or voided pursuant to subparagraph (d) shall install any subsurface sewage or waste disposal system.  Installation of such a system after the installer's permit has been suspended or voided pursuant to subparagraph (d) shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this subdivision that is subject to the penalties specified in RSA 485-A:43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who desires to install or repair a waste disposal system for his own domicile shall not be required to obtain an installer's permit as provided in paragraph I, provided he complies with rules adopted by the department relative to such systems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:38 Approval to Increase Load on a Sewage Disposal System. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Prior to expanding any structure or occupying any existing structure on a full-time basis, which would increase the load on a sewage disposal system, the owner of such structure shall submit an application for approval of the sewage disposal system to the department.  Application for approval shall include one of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Evidence that the existing sewage disposal system meets the requirements of the department for the intended usage or the town's minimum standards for use or occupancy prescribed under RSA 48-A:11, whichever is more stringent.

II. The fee for application under this section shall not exceed fees charged for new design applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. (a) No construction or operational approval shall be required from the department prior to expanding, relocating, or replacing any structure that does not increase the load on a sewage disposal system, as long as all of the following conditions are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1)(A) The lot is served by a sewage disposal system that received construction and operational approval from the department within 20 years of the date of the issuance of a building permit for the proposed expansion, relocation, or replacement;  or

(3) When applicable, the proposed expansion, relocation, or replacement complies with the requirements of the shoreland water quality protection act, RSA 483-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An owner of a project that requires department approval to proceed because neither of the conditions of subparagraphs (a)(1)(A) or (B) are met, may either submit for approval a design for a new sewage disposal system or apply for a permit by rule for in-kind replacement under RSA 485-A:33, IV.  Under either approach, once approval for the sewage disposal system is received from the department, work may commence on expanding, relocating, or replacing the structure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:39 Waterfront Property Sale;  Site Assessment Study. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Prior to the execution of a purchase and sale agreement for any developed waterfront property using a septic disposal system, the owner of the property shall, at the owner's expense, engage a permitted subsurface sewer or waste disposal system designer to perform a site assessment study to determine if the site meets the current standards for septic disposal systems established by the department.  The site assessment study shall include an on-site inspection.  If the site assessment is not complete prior to the time that the buyer and seller enter into a purchase and sale contract, the contract shall be subject to the buyer's acceptance of the completed site assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The site assessment study form shall become a part of the purchase and sale agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The site assessment study form, with stated findings, shall be given to the buyer and the seller and receipt of the form shall be acknowledged in writing by the buyer and the seller.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Failure of the seller or the seller's agent to notify the buyer of the findings or deliver the completed site assessment study form pursuant to paragraph III of this section shall be a violation and, notwithstanding RSA 651:2, shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The site assessment study shall consist of 3 sections:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Section A shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the seller and the seller's agent and the location and a brief description of the property, including the tax map reference and lot number.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Section B shall include the lot size, slope, loading (based on the number of bedrooms in the structure), water source, soil type, and estimated seasonal high water table information from U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service maps.  A space shall be included on the form for the permitted designer to write his assessment of the site for the current use of the system, based upon the criteria and information required in this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Section C shall include information about the present septic disposal system, if available.  If the installed system was approved by the department, a copy of the approval form, approval number and plan shall be attached to the site assessment study.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The department shall design the site assessment form pursuant to paragraph V of this section.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A relative to the procedures for the availability and distribution of the form to interested parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. An assessment indicating that the site fails to meet any of the criteria established under this section shall not prohibit the sale of the property but shall be disclosed to the buyer as full and proper notice of the possible limitations of the site for a septic disposal system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If the septic disposal system designer, during the course of a site assessment, discovers evidence that there is sewage discharge on the ground surface or directly into surface waters, the designer shall notify, in writing, the department and the local health officer, and shall include that information in the site assessment report.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:40 Reconsideration and Appeal Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If any person submitting plans and specifications to the department for its approval is aggrieved or dissatisfied with its decision, he may file a motion for reconsideration and shall have a right of appeal from the decision of the department in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Within 20 days after any decision of the department, any person whose rights may be directly affected may apply to the department for reconsideration of any matter determined by the department in its decision, specifying in the motion for reconsideration the grounds therefor, and the department may reconsider and revise its decision if in the opinion of the department good reason therefor is stated in said motion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such motion shall set forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision of the department is unlawful or unreasonable.  No appeal from any decision of the department shall be taken unless the appellant shall have made application for reconsideration as provided in this section, and when such application shall have been made, no ground not set forth in such application shall be urged, relied on, or given any consideration by the court, unless the court for good cause shown shall allow the appellant to specify additional grounds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the filing of a motion for reconsideration, the department shall within 30 days either grant or deny the motion, and, at the same time, shall affirm, modify or reverse its decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 30 days after the application for reconsideration is denied, or if the application is granted, then within 30 days after the decision on such reconsideration, the applicant may appeal by petition to the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Upon the hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the party seeking to set aside the decision of the department to show that the same is unreasonable or unlawful, and all findings of the department upon all questions of fact properly before it shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable;  and the order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated, except for errors of law, unless the court is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that the decision is unjust or unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any person whose rights may be directly affected by said appeal may appear and become a party, or the court may order such persons to be joined as parties as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Upon the filing of an appeal, the clerk of court shall issue a summons requiring a certified copy of the record appealed from to be filed with the court.  The filing of an appeal shall not suspend the decision appealed from, unless the court, on application and for good cause shown, shall grant a restraining order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. All evidence transferred by the department shall be, and all additional evidence received may be, considered by the court regardless of any technical rules which might have rendered the same inadmissible if originally offered in the trial of an action at law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The final judgment upon every appeal shall be a decree dismissing the appeal, or vacating the decision complained of in whole or in part, as the case may be;  but in case such decision is wholly or partly vacated the court may also, in its discretion, remand the matter to the department for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with the decree, as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. An order of court to send up the record may be complied with by filing either the original papers or duly certified copies, or of such portions of such papers, as the order may specify, together with a certified statement of such other facts as show the grounds of the action appealed from.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The court may take evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same with his findings of fact and conclusions of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Costs shall not be allowed against the department unless it shall appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence, or in bad faith, or with malice in making the decision appealed from.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. All proceedings under this chapter shall be entitled to a speedy hearing.  If such hearing cannot be had within 30 days after the filing of the appeal, upon request of the appellant the matter shall be referred to a master.

<codesect>
To administer the provisions of this chapter and to perform such other related duties as may be required, the department of environmental services is designated as the agency to receive and utilize any federal or other aids which may at any time be made available in the interest of water pollution control in the basin.  The department is empowered to hire consulting engineering firms for purposes of project design and to employ such professional, technical, clerical, accounting, or other staff or consulting personnel as are required to implement the provisions of this subdivision and to arrange for the orderly transfer of ownership and operation of existing pollution abatement facilities to the department on behalf of the state of New Hampshire within the limits of legislative appropriations.  Any personnel (other than consultants) employed by the department shall be subject to the personnel laws of the state.  This subdivision shall in no way impair or render null and void existing contracts between municipalities, contractors or other parties, or any of them, in connection with pollution control projects or sewerage, sewage or waste service contracts within the basin.  Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as prohibiting future sewerage or waste service contracts otherwise authorized by law between municipalities directly connected to the regional facilities provided for by this subdivision and other persons, including but not limited to municipalities, served or to be served by such facilities but not directly connected to such facilities.  All such future contracts, however, shall be submitted at least 60 days in advance of their effective dates to the department, which is empowered to disapprove the terms of any such future contract in whole or in part when in its judgment the efficient administration or the purposes of this subdivision would be adversely affected, and such contract shall not be valid to the extent it is disapproved.  In any such contract, unless otherwise specifically provided in the contract, the person or persons served by such regional facility but not directly connected to such facility shall have strict responsibility for the accurate measurement of the amount of sewage or waste disposed of by such person or persons and shall be liable to the municipality directly connected to such regional facilities for the entire amount of sewage or waste, as measured, if any inaccuracy is in favor of such municipality, and for the actual amount of sewage or waste, as estimated, if any inaccuracy is in favor of such person or persons.  The commissioner is authorized to adopt, pursuant to RSA 541-A and after public hearing, such rules as are necessary to implement the provisions of this subdivision.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall annually, at the beginning of each fiscal year, assess each municipality served by the regional sewage disposal facilities provided for by this subdivision, a sum sufficient to recover its proportional share of the total in relation to the total costs estimated to be incurred during said fiscal year in treating, transporting and disposal of sewage of the communities served and those to be served;  the proportional share of each community shall be determined by the procedure provided for in paragraph IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall annually, at the beginning of each fiscal year, assess each municipality served or to be served by the regional sewage disposal facilities provided for by the provisions of this subdivision the costs estimated to be incurred during said fiscal year in administering this subdivision, plus a charge for amortization charges on such costs of all facilities amounting to 5 percent of the total amortization charges, meaning principal and interest, on such charges.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The respective share of the assessments made in paragraphs I and II shall be paid to the department by each municipality quarterly on July fifteenth, October fifteenth, January fifteenth, and April fifteenth of that fiscal year, except for capital cost recovery assessments which shall be paid annually on July fifteenth.  After the close of each fiscal year, the department shall ascertain its actual total expenses in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and then shall adjust the assessment for the second quarterly payment of the new fiscal year for each such municipality served for any under-payment or over-payment by each such municipality served for the prior fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The assessments provided to be made by this section shall be made by taking into account the volume and strength of the industrial, domestic, commercial, and all other waste discharges treated or the estimated volume and strength of the industrial, domestic, commercial and all other waste discharges to be treated and techniques of treatment required.  Proportional costs as determined by the department, associated with transporting raw and treated sewage through a major interceptor from a municipality at which it is generated or is to be generated to the point of treatment or discharge shall be allocated to the municipality which uses or will use the interceptor on the basis of volume and distance traveled or estimated volume and distance traveled.  In determining said assessments for each municipality, the department shall abide by federal regulations which govern the allocation of costs and receipt of payments by industry for industrial discharges.  Any operating and maintenance costs over and above what has been determined to be proportional by the department shall be an obligation of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The municipality may recover charges assessed by means of user charges, connection fees, or such other techniques as may be utilized under state and local law, including sewage, sewerage, and waste service contracts, except that municipalities with industrial waste must abide by federal and state regulations which govern recovery of costs from said industries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All funds collected by the department by virtue of the assessments authorized under this section shall be paid to the state treasurer who shall keep the same in a special fund.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:51 Replacement Fund Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established a nonlapsing, revolving fund to provide capital for repair and replacement of major components of the water pollution control facilities administered under this subdivision which cannot be absorbed as regular budgetary items.  The replacement fund is to be capitalized by contributions from the members served by the facilities based on each member's projected usage of the facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The fund shall equal 5 percent of the equipment and other depreciable assets of the treatment facilities.  The value of the equipment and other depreciable assets shall be computed every 5 years, beginning in 1990, and shall be based on current replacement costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each member's share of the total fund shall be contributed over a period of 10 years after the initial establishment of the fund and shall be paid as a yearly surcharge to the member's operating charges.  Thereafter, each member's surcharge shall be prorated as membership and design changes require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Once a member has fully funded its share of the replacement fund, the member shall make no further contributions until the fund is utilized for repair or replacement of a facility used by that member.  Expenses for which the fund is used shall be proportionally charged against each member's contributions to the fund for the facilities utilizing the fund, which will subsequently be reimbursed by the member in successive years in addition to the member's yearly contribution to the fund, until the member's share of the fund is fully restored.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a repair or replacement cost exceeds the value of the fund established for that particular facility, the repair cost shall be paid out of the portion of the fund established for other facilities, but reimbursement to the fund shall always be assessed back to members based on their projected usage of the facilities needing repair.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. As new facilities, if any, are added to the system, additional assessments shall be made to the members benefiting from these facilities, prorated on the basis of projected use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If a new member joins the system, the assessments shall be modified to reflect the new member's benefit from the facilities, and excess prior payments made by other members, if any, shall be credited to their accounts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. All contracts paid for using the fund shall be submitted to the governor and council for approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. This nonlapsing, revolving special purpose fund is continually appropriated to be used by the department in accordance with this subdivision.  All moneys shall be deposited with the state treasurer who shall keep this money in a separate fund, notwithstanding RSA 6:12.  The state treasurer shall invest the moneys deposited with him as provided by law.  Interest received on investments made by the state treasurer shall also be credited to the fund.  All such interest shall be added to each member's share of the fund based on each member's contribution to it.
