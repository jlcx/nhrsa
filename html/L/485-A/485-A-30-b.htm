&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:30-b Protective Well Radii. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All lots, including lots created prior to August 20, 1989, shall be subject to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Rules adopted under this section concerning such lots shall include provisions allowing abutting lot owners to overlap their respective well radii for their mutual benefit and provisions allowing well radii to extend over property lines onto state and locally-mandated property line setbacks, recorded easements, or land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For private wells serving commercial buildings, the entire protective well radius shall be maintained on one or more of the following:  on-log, on a recorded easement, on land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development, or on state and locally mandated property line setbacks.  For the purposes of this section, the term "commercial building'' shall not include a residence which is also used for commercial purposes unless the total water withdrawal exceeds 600 gallons per day.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For private wells serving buildings other than commercial buildings, if the protective well radius cannot be wholly maintained on an existing lot of record due to the size or other physical characteristics of the lot, then the on-lot protective radius shall be maximized to the extent practicable.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, the protective well radius shall be maintained on one or more of the following:  on-lot, on a recorded easement, on land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development, or on state and locally mandated property line setbacks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any person submitting plans and specifications for a sewage or waste disposal system for a property which is or will be served by an on-lot well, shall show the location or proposed location of the well, or a designated area within which the well will be located, on such plans and shall show the protective radius as specified in the department's rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whenever the department approves a septic plan with an on-lot well radius which is less than the optimum standard, the department shall notify the applicant of the consequences of such reduced radius and advise the applicant whether special precautions should be taken relative to well installation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the well is not installed prior to the sewage or waste disposal system being constructed, then the property owner shall provide the water well contractor with a copy of the approved plan showing the location of the well, and the water well contractor shall ensure, to the best of his ability that the well is installed in accordance with the approved plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) When, for reasons of the condition of the lot or the placement of buildings thereon, the well cannot be installed as shown on the approved plan, the water well contractor shall advise and consult with the property owner, or the property owner's agent, on the best possible alternative location, considering distance to property boundaries and to the sewage or waste disposal system.  Using a standard release form prepared by the department, the water well contractor shall alert the owner to the consequences of the alternate installation, including the potential loss of the protection of any portion of the radius which extends over the property line.  The owner, or the owner's agent, may defer to the designer of the sewage or waste disposal system or may allow the water well contractor to proceed in the identified alternative location.  Prior to installing the well in the identified alternative location, the well contractor shall, using the standard release form, obtain a written acknowledgment, from the property owner, or the owner's agent, that the consequences are understood.  The designer shall prepare an amended plan showing the actual location of the well.  The property owner shall forward the amended plan, together with a copy of the signed release form, to the department and the local code enforcement officer or other appropriate designated local official prior to using the well.  If the on-lot protective well radius is less than the optimum prescribed standard, the owner shall record the release form, upon which the actual protective radius shall be noted, together with a narrative description of the location of the well in the registry of deeds, and a copy of the recorded release form shall be filed with the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For lots approved under RSA 485-A:29, the rules adopted under this section concerning such lots shall include provisions allowing abutting lot owners to overlap their respective well radii for their mutual benefit by allowing well radii to extend over property lines, onto state and locally mandated property line setbacks, recorded easements, or land which is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development.  If after a lot is created pursuant to this section, the well cannot be installed as shown on the subdivision plan, then the provisions of RSA 485-A:30-b, I(d), (e), (f), and (g) shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "cluster development'' means a form of residential subdivision that permits dwelling units to be grouped on sites or lots with dimensions, frontages, and setbacks reduced from conventional requirements, provided that the remaining land area is permanently designated as open space for cluster development.  For cluster developments the following provisions shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Where the sewage waste disposal systems are located off of the individual home lots or the cluster development is served by municipal sewers, the wells and associated protective radii serving those home lots need not be confined to the individual lot which each well serves so long as all wells and their associated protective radii are confined within the tract of home lots and common land permanently designated as open space, and shall not encumber property situated outside of the cluster development except by recorded easement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Where the home lots are serviced by on-lot sewage or waste disposal systems, wells and their protective radii may be located wholly or partially on common land permanently designated as open space, and shall not encumber adjacent lots or property situated outside of the cluster development except by recorded easement.  The department shall not approve such off-lot wells and radii unless the lot owner or developer demonstrates to the department's satisfaction, by means of recorded easements, land use restrictions or other appropriate mechanisms, that the well owner will be able to maintain and service the well in perpetuity and that the area covered by the protective well radius is permanently dedicated to a use which precludes development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A providing for protective well radii for private water wells, and for regulation of land use within the radii boundary.
