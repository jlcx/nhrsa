Any person who shall violate any provisions of this subdivision or RSA 485-A:4-6, or any lawful regulation of the department issued pursuant to this subdivision or RSA 485-A:4-6, or any condition or limitation in a permit issued under this subdivision or RSA 485-A:4-6, or who shall fail, neglect, or refuse to obey any order lawfully issued pursuant to this subdivision or RSA 485-A:4-6, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of such violation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The department shall issue a written cease and desist order against any discharge or act in violation of this subdivision or RSA 485-A:4-6 or lawful regulation of the department made under them or any condition of any permit lawfully issued by the department, and any such discharge or act may be enjoined by the superior court upon application of the attorney general, whether the court is in term time or vacation.

Municipalities may apply to a justice of the superior court for injunctive relief against existing or impending violations of RSA 485-A:17, or any rule or order issued under that section. The municipality shall give notice of any such action to the attorney general and the commissioner of environmental services, who may take such steps as they deem necessary to ensure uniform statewide enforcement, including but not limited to joining the action, assuming sole prosecution of the action, or, as of right dismissing the action without prejudice. Such notice shall be given at least 30 days prior to the commencement of any such action, unless more immediate action is necessary to prevent irreparable environmental damage or other serious public harm, in which case such notice shall be given as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the date of commencement of the action.

If any municipality fails to comply with an order under paragraph V-a, it shall be subject to an administrative fine pursuant to paragraph V.  Each day of continuous violation shall constitute a separate offense.  The department shall take the following steps:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) The department shall conduct an investigation of opportunities for joint action with other municipalities, the availability of private facilities, and possible facility sites within the municipality.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) The department shall report findings to the precinct and municipality, and seek local agreement to an acceptable solution to the septage problem.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) If no agreement is reached within 60 calendar days after the findings are delivered, the department shall schedule and hold a public hearing in the municipality.  The hearing shall be held to solicit alternative septage disposal solutions for the municipality.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in 2 or more public places in the municipality for at least 14 calendar days before it is held, and shall be published in a newspaper of local circulation, at least twice, not less than 10 days prior to the hearing date.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) If no agreement is reached within 45 calendar days after the hearing, the department shall either order the municipality to participate in an existing or planned approved facility, or shall recommend that land within the municipality be taken by eminent domain for the establishment of an approved facility.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) Before land is taken by eminent domain, the department shall hold a public hearing in the municipality.
