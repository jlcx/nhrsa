&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After the effective date of any pretreatment standards established and prescribed by the department pursuant to RSA 485-A:4, XV, no person shall discharge into the collection system or the sewage treatment facility of any municipality or other governmental entity being served by or under orders to construct a public sewage treatment facility, nor discharge to the surface waters of the state if such person will be served by the public sewage treatment facility upon construction of such facility, any waste that does not comply with such pretreatment standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In setting a date for conformance to pretreatment standards, the department may establish compliance schedules providing a reasonable time for compliance and may give due consideration to expected in-service dates of public sewage and waste treatment facilities not in existence at the time of establishment of pretreatment standards applicable to such facilities.  Any such compliance schedule shall be consistent with the purposes and requirements of federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No municipality or other governmental entity owning or controlling any public sewage and waste treatment facility shall permit the discharge of any waste to such facility which does not comply with pretreatment standards established by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Pretreatment standards or effluent limits adopted by a municipality as part of its sewer use ordinance or industrial pretreatment program and approved by the department shall be enforceable by the department as pretreatment standards established under RSA 485-A:4, XV and rules adopted under RSA 485-A:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department of environmental services may require the installation and operation of monitoring programs by persons subject to pretreatment standards to ensure adherence to such standards.
