&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:53 Insurance. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department shall purchase insurance, including extended coverage insurance, to protect the pollution control facilities administered under this subdivision against fire, vandalism, and malicious mischief, and to provide liability, general and pollution, protection for the facilities.  Such insurance shall be purchased through the director of plant and property management, after consultation with the attorney general as to the amount of coverage, the cost of which shall be included in the user fee.  If the department determines that any of the foregoing insurance is unavailable or uneconomical, it may request the governor and council to waive the provisions of this section.  Any waiver granted pursuant to this section shall apply only to the fiscal year in which such waiver is granted.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as a waiver of the state's sovereign immunity regardless of the department's ability to procure the types of insurance described in this section.
