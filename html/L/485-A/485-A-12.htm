&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:12 Enforcement of Classification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After adoption of a given classification for a stream, lake, pond, tidal water, or section of such water, the department shall enforce such classification by appropriate action in the courts of the state, and it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to dispose of any sewage, industrial, or other wastes, either alone or in conjunction with any other person or persons, in such a manner as will lower the quality of the waters of the stream, lake, pond, tidal water, or section of such water below the minimum requirements of the adopted classification.  If the department shall set a time limit for abatement of pollution under paragraph II, and it becomes apparent at any time during the compliance period that full compliance with the adopted classification will not be attained by the end of such period due to the failure of any person to take action reasonably calculated to secure abatement of the pollution within the time specified, the department shall notify such person or persons in writing.  If such person or persons shall fail or neglect to take appropriate steps to comply with the classification requirements within a period of 30 days after such notice, the department shall seek appropriate action in the courts of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If, after adoption of a classification of any stream, lake, pond, or tidal water, or section of such water, including those classified by RSA 485-A:11, it is found that there is a source or sources of pollution which lower the quality of the waters in question below the minimum requirements of the classification so established, the person or persons responsible for the discharging of such pollution shall be required to abate such pollution within a time to be fixed by the department.  If such pollution is of municipal or industrial origin, the time limit set by the department for such abatement shall be not less than 2 years nor more than 5 years.  For good cause shown, the department may from time to time extend any time limit established under this paragraph.  Any determination by the department under this paragraph shall be subject to appeal as provided for in RSA 485-A:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No activity, including construction and operation of facilities, that requires certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act and that may result in a discharge, as that term is applied under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, to surface waters of the state may commence unless the department certifies that any such discharge complies with the state surface water quality standards applicable to the classification for the receiving surface water body.  The department shall provide its response to a request for certification to the federal agency or authority responsible for issuing the license, permit, or registration that requires the certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act.  Certification shall include any conditions on, modifications to, or monitoring of the proposed activity necessary to provide assurance that the proposed discharge complies with applicable surface water quality standards.  The department may enforce compliance with any such conditions, modifications, or monitoring requirements as provided in RSA 485-A:22.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No activity that involves surface water withdrawal or diversion of surface water that requires registration under RSA 488:3, that does not otherwise require the certification required under paragraph III, and which was not in active operation as of the effective date of this paragraph, may commence unless the department certifies that the surface water withdrawal or diversion of surface water complies with state surface water quality standards applicable to the classification for the surface water body.  The certification shall include any conditions on, modifications to, or monitoring of the proposed activity necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the proposed activity complies with applicable surface water quality standards.  The department may enforce compliance with any such conditions, modifications, or monitoring requirements as provided in RSA 485-A:22.
