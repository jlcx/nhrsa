&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:7-c Issuance of Certificates. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon satisfactory completion by an applicant of the established requirements, the department shall issue to the applicant a suitable certificate designating the applicant's competency.  The certificate shall indicate the level of operation for which the operator is qualified.  The certificate shall remain in effect for 2 years from the date of issuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Certificates shall be renewed biennially and shall be accompanied by a $50 renewal fee, which shall be deposited pursuant to RSA 485-A:7-a, II.  If the renewal fee is not submitted within 90 days of the certificate's expiration date, the certified individual's name shall be removed from the current status and the certificate shall be deemed expired.  The department shall charge a late fee of 50 percent of the renewal fee in addition to the renewal fee if the renewal is late.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Certificates may be issued, upon payment of the $50 fee, without examination, for a comparable classification to any person actively seeking employment in New Hampshire who holds a certificate issued by the appropriate certification agency of any federal, state, interstate, territorial, or other jurisdiction if, in the judgment of the committee, the certification requirements of the jurisdiction granting such certification do not conflict with the department's rules and are not less stringent than rules adopted under this subdivision.  The fee shall be deposited pursuant to RSA 485-A:7-a, II.
