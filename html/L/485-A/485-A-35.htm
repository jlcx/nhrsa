&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-A:35 Permit Eligibility;  Exemption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) All applications, plans, and specifications submitted in accordance with this chapter for subsurface sewage or waste disposal systems shall be prepared and signed by the individual who is directly responsible for them and who has a permit issued by the department to perform the work.  The department shall issue a permit to any individual who applies to the department, pays a fee of $80, and demonstrates a sound working knowledge of the procedures and practices required in the site evaluation, design, and operation of subsurface sewage or waste disposal systems.  The department shall require an oral or written examination or both to determine who may qualify for a permit.  Permits shall be issued from January 1 and shall expire December 31 of every other year, subject to the grace periods specified in subparagraphs (c) and (d).  Permits shall be renewable upon proper application, payment of a biennial permit fee of $80, and documentation of compliance with the continuing education requirement of subparagraph (b).  A permit issued to any individual may be suspended, revoked or not renewed only for just cause and after the permit holder has had a full opportunity to be heard by the department.  An appeal from a decision to revoke, suspend, or not renew a permit may be taken pursuant to RSA 541.  All fees shall be deposited in the subsurface systems fund established in RSA 485-A:30, I-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Permitted designers shall complete a minimum of 6 hours biennially of continuing education approved by the department.  Any permitted designer who is also a permitted septic system installer under RSA 485-A:36 may fulfill the continuing education requirements for both permits with the same approved 6 hours of continuing education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A permitted designer who fails to file a complete application for renewal, the biennial permit fee, and documentation that the required continuing education has been completed with the department prior to the expiration of the permit shall pay an additional late renewal fee of $80 with the renewal application, biennial permit fee, and documentation, provided such fees, application, and documentation are filed with the department within 30 days of the permit expiration date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the renewal application, biennial permit fee, late renewal fee, and documentation are not filed within 30 days of the permit expiration date, the permit shall be deemed suspended.  The permit holder may request reinstatement of the permit within 60 days of the suspension by submitting a complete application for renewal, the biennial permit fee specified in subparagraph (a), the late renewal fee specified in subparagraph (c), documentation that the required continuing education has been completed, and a reinstatement fee of $80.  If the individual does not request reinstatement within 60 days of the suspension, the permit shall be deemed void.  Any individual whose permit has become void who wishes to obtain a designer's permit shall apply as for a new permit pursuant to subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) No individual whose permit has been suspended or voided pursuant to subparagraph (d) shall submit any design to the department for a subsurface sewage or waste disposal system.  Submittal of such a design after the designer's permit has been suspended or voided pursuant to subparagraph (d) shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this subdivision that is subject to the penalties specified in RSA 485-A:43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who desires to submit plans and specifications for a sewage or waste disposal system for the person's own domicile shall not be required to obtain a permit under this paragraph provided that the person attests to eligibility for this exemption in the application for construction approval.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, prepared under the supervision of a professional engineer licensed to practice engineering in the state of New Hampshire, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to requiring a permit holder to be a licensed professional engineer with a civil or sanitary designation in order to submit applications for construction approval in certain complex situations.  All fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the subsurface systems fund established in RSA 485-A:30, I-b.
