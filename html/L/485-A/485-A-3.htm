<codesect>
It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative intent, that the department shall, in the administration and enforcement of this chapter, strive to provide that all sources of pollution within the state shall be abated within such times and to such degrees as shall be required to satisfy the provisions of state law or applicable federal law, whichever is more stringent.  To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing nor the aims of any joint state-federal permit program that may from time to time be agreed upon and in force pursuant to this chapter and applicable federal law, the department shall adhere to the following policies:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Insofar as practicable, the initial objective of the control program will be to obtain the installation of primary treatment (with adequate disinfection where sewage discharges are involved) for all discharges of sewage and industrial wastes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The second objective will be to require the installation of secondary treatment whenever such additional treatment is necessary to protect the uses assigned to the particular stream classification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The third objective, after all stream classification requirements throughout the state have been satisfied, will be to continue the program of pollution abatement by installing other forms of treatment desirable to maintain all surface waters of the state in as clean a condition as possible, consistent with available assistance funds and technological developments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Until such time as appropriate methodology and reasonable levels of financial assistance are made available, municipalities with combined sewer systems shall not be required to provide treatment facilities with capacity greater than that necessary to handle anticipated peak dry weather flows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A further objective will be to advance the development and application of innovative/alternative waste treatment systems with guidelines, procedures, pilot projects, demonstration projects, community projects or in any other manner the department may elect.
