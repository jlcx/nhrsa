<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The fund shall equal 5 percent of the equipment and other depreciable assets of the treatment facilities.  The value of the equipment and other depreciable assets shall be computed every 5 years, beginning in 1990, and shall be based on current replacement costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each member's share of the total fund shall be contributed over a period of 10 years after the initial establishment of the fund and shall be paid as a yearly surcharge to the member's operating charges.  Thereafter, each member's surcharge shall be prorated as membership and design changes require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Once a member has fully funded its share of the replacement fund, the member shall make no further contributions until the fund is utilized for repair or replacement of a facility used by that member.  Expenses for which the fund is used shall be proportionally charged against each member's contributions to the fund for the facilities utilizing the fund, which will subsequently be reimbursed by the member in successive years in addition to the member's yearly contribution to the fund, until the member's share of the fund is fully restored.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a repair or replacement cost exceeds the value of the fund established for that particular facility, the repair cost shall be paid out of the portion of the fund established for other facilities, but reimbursement to the fund shall always be assessed back to members based on their projected usage of the facilities needing repair.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. As new facilities, if any, are added to the system, additional assessments shall be made to the members benefiting from these facilities, prorated on the basis of projected use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If a new member joins the system, the assessments shall be modified to reflect the new member's benefit from the facilities, and excess prior payments made by other members, if any, shall be credited to their accounts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. All contracts paid for using the fund shall be submitted to the governor and council for approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. This nonlapsing, revolving special purpose fund is continually appropriated to be used by the department in accordance with this subdivision.  All moneys shall be deposited with the state treasurer who shall keep this money in a separate fund, notwithstanding RSA 6:12.  The state treasurer shall invest the moneys deposited with him as provided by law.  Interest received on investments made by the state treasurer shall also be credited to the fund.  All such interest shall be added to each member's share of the fund based on each member's contribution to it.
