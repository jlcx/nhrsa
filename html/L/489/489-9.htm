<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No waiver shall be granted if doing so results in a violation of any federal requirement, unless the federal requirement expressly provides that its provisions may be waived and the federal agency charged with enforcing the requirement agrees with the waiver.
