&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 489:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This chapter is intended to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Establish an integrated land development permit option that may be sought, at the discretion of the applicant, as an alternative to seeking one or more individual land development permits or approvals issued by the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Provide a coordinated approach and holistic perspective in regulating land development activities to protect the quality and functions of New Hampshire's natural environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Establish an alternative project review and permitting process to improve communication and coordination between multiple organizations and entities involved in the permitting of proposed projects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Establish a structured pre-application process to provide enhanced guidance earlier in the project design process to facilitate compliance and improved environmental performance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Encourage and facilitate implementation of environmentally superior projects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Recognize that the degree of relatedness of the affected programs presents a unique opportunity to achieve efficiencies and savings that are not possible to achieve by similar means within the other programs administered by the department.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

VI. Within 45 days of receiving a complete application, the department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the department does not issue either a permit or a written denial within the 14-day period, the applicant shall be deemed to have a permit by default and may proceed with the project as presented in the application.  The authorization provided by this subparagraph shall not relieve the applicant of complying with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter and any chapter relating to the applicable affected programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon receipt of a written request from an applicant, the department shall issue written confirmation that the applicant has a permit by default pursuant to subparagraph (b), which authorizes the applicant to proceed with the project as presented in the application and requires the work to comply with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter and any chapter relating to the applicable affected programs.
