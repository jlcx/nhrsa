<codesect>
Upon written notice from the department, the owner of a non-permitted existing dam shall submit an application for a permit for said dam to the department along with a fee based on the classification of the dam under RSA 482:9.  The application shall provide such information as the department may require to determine whether or not the dam is a menace to the public safety.  Following a review of the permit application, the department may issue a permit to the owner with necessary conditions for the repair or reconstruction of the dam which the department deems necessary for the public safety.  Such repair work shall be undertaken within a time period fixed by the department.
