&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 482:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court declares that there is a statewide need for conservation and control of water in streams, rivers, lakes and ponds by the repair of dams now in disrepair, the construction of new dams, the construction of hydro-energy production facilities as defined in RSA 481:2, IV, and stream clearance and channel improvement.  These actions are needed for the regulation of the water levels of lakes and ponds, the flow of water for fire prevention, protection to lessen flood damage, the enhancement of public safety, the improvement of recreational facilities within the state, and for any similar public purpose.

<codesect>
Words and phrases used in this chapter shall mean and be construed as follows, except where a different meaning is clearly intended from the context:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Classification of a dam'' means the potential hazard classification placed on a dam by the department based on the potential threat to life and the potential extent of property damage in the event of accidental damage to, or failure of, the dam structure.  The classifications shall be "non-menace,'' "low hazard potential,'' "significant hazard potential,'' or "high hazard potential.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) "Dam'' means any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, which impounds or diverts water and which has a height of 6 feet or more, or is located at the outlet of a great pond.  A roadway culvert shall not be considered a dam if its invert is at the natural bed of the water course, it has adequate discharge capacity, and it does not impound water under normal circumstances.  Artificial barriers which create surface impoundments for liquid industrial or liquid commercial wastes, septage, or sewage, regardless of height or storage capacity, shall be considered dams.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An artificial barrier at a storm water detention basin, which impounds 0.5 acre-foot or less of water during normal conditions, shall not be considered a dam unless its height is 10 feet or greater or its maximum storage is 6 acre-feet or greater.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Commissioner'' means the commissioner of the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Department'' means the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Dam in disrepair'' means a dam which is a menace to public safety and is incapable of safely impounding flood waters to its crest, or is incapable of maintaining a reasonably constant level of waters impounded, or is one which does not contain adequate gates and sluiceways to provide for the holding or controlled discharge of waters impounded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. "Emergency action plan'' means a written document delineating a prescribed sequence of actions to be taken by a dam owner to inform the authorities and others downstream of an impending or actual sudden release of water caused by an accident to, or failure of, the dam.  This plan shall be developed in consultation with local officials and notification of the plan shall be given to the general public who would be affected by a sudden release of water caused by an accident or other failure of the dam.  The plan shall be kept on file with the local emergency management director and other local officials as deemed appropriate by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. "Mills'' shall include both manufacturing plants and plants at which electric power is generated for public distribution or for the operation of mills, railroads or public utilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. "Person'' means any individual, partnership, association, corporation, company, organization or legal entity of any kind.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. [Omitted.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. "Reconstruction'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A change in the height, length, or discharge capacity of the structure;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Restoring a breached dam or one in ruins;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Modification of flashboards which either increases their height or increases the headwater elevation at which the flashboards will fail;  or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 482:4 Investigation of High and Low Levels. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department is authorized to make such investigations as, in its opinion, the public good requires with respect to high or low water levels in the inland public waters of the state and the rights, instrumentalities and practices which affect or control such levels with a view to the exercise of such control, in a manner consistent with public and private rights and interests, as will best promote the public health and safety and the enjoyment and value of such public waters.  When the department may deem expedient, it may ascertain the extent to which owners and managers of dams take into consideration variations of runoff and plan for and anticipate emergencies.  Owners of dams, at the reasonable request of the department shall make available to the department such records of water levels and flow of inland public waters as are made and kept by such owners to assist the department in knowing the remaining storage capacity of reservoirs, whether created by dams or otherwise, and to gauge the flow of streams.  From time to time, the department may call to conference owners of dams for the purpose of obtaining cooperation in the regulation of stream flow to minimize damage to public and private property at times of high water.  Whenever in the opinion of the department an emergency exists or is threatened whereby the public health or safety may be jeopardized by the release or withholding of stored waters, it shall direct such action by the owner or manager of a dam with respect to the release or withholding of water as it may deem necessary in the public interest.
