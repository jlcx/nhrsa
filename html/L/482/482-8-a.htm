&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 482:8-a Annual Registration Fee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Annual registration fees for dams shall be payable to the department on January 1 of each calendar year.  Yearly dam registration fees shall be based on classification as follows:  Low hazard potential = $400;  Significant hazard potential = $750;  High hazard potential = $1,500.  If the hazard classification designated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a dam differs from the classification designated by the department, the annual dam registration fees shall be based on the classification designated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission except that a dam which is classified as a non-menace dam by the department shall be exempt from the annual dam registration fee for as long as the dam is classified by the department as a non-menace dam.  Revenues from this annual registration are to be collected by the department and deposited in the dam maintenance fund established in RSA 482:55 to be used for the inspection of dams.
