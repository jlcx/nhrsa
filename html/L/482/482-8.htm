&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 482:8 Orders and Permits Recorded. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Permitting of a dam pursuant to RSA 482:5 or the granting of a permit for a dam pursuant to RSA 482:7 by the department does not relieve the owner from meeting the requirements of public safety or other provisions of law nor does it convey a property right or authorize any injury to property or invasion of other rights.  The department shall record any orders or permits issued under the provisions of this section with the registry of deeds in the county or counties in which the dam and flowage are situated, and no fee shall be charged for such recording.
