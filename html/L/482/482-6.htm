<codesect>
Upon written notice from the department, the owner of a non-permitted dam on the outlet of a great pond shall comply with the provisions of RSA 482:5.  The department, after 30 days' notice to abutters, to the governing body of the municipality in which the dam is situated, to the fish and game department, and to the department of safety, shall hold a public hearing, notice of which shall be published 7 days before the hearing in one newspaper of general circulation throughout the state.  If, as a result of said hearing and further investigation, the department shall be of the opinion that management and control of the outlet of the great pond would be of benefit to the public, it may order the management of said outlet under whatever conditions it finds necessary to protect the public rights and safety;  provided, however, the owner shall be fully compensated for any loss sustained by action of the department with respect to a dam which was previously registered or legalized.
