&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department shall administer the drinking water and groundwater trust fund through the MTBE remediation bureau.  Subject to the approval of the fiscal committee of the general court, trust fund proceeds sufficient to fund the department's MTBE remediation bureau and qualifying projects shall be transferred to the department and maintained in a separate, nonlapsing account, continually appropriated to the department for the purpose of paying all costs of this program.  The department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Investigate, manage, and remediate contaminated groundwater.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Protect against future contamination or impacted drinking water sources through measures including, but not limited to, the expansion of drinking water infrastructure or drinking water source protection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Assist local and regional entities in the development and administration of local wellhead protection programs, including delineation of wellhead protection areas and the inventory and management of activities which have a potential effect on groundwater quality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Maintain a statewide map identifying the classes of groundwater.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Measure levels of contamination statewide and generate maps to show the areas of greatest contamination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Maintain an inventory of wells serving public water supply systems, and to the extent practicable other wells, and establish a priority list for delineation of systems that are currently contaminated with MTBE.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Provide funding through cost-sharing grants to municipalities, municipally-owned water utilities, and water utilities regulated by the public utilities commission for the design, construction, and extension of public water systems, and the establishment and expansion of wellhead protection areas where they provide the most cost-effective method for providing safe and clean drinking water.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall adopt rules, under RSA 541-A, necessary to implement this chapter.  Such rules may include funding qualifications, funding application requirements, provisions for cost-sharing related to municipal projects, and other provisions consistent with the purposes and requirements of this chapter.
