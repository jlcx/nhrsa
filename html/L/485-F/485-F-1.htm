&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-F:1 Purpose Statement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court recognizes that the widespread and persistent contamination of the state's drinking water and groundwater by MTBE requires a comprehensive strategy designed to ensure the continued availability of safe drinking water for all New Hampshire citizens.  Therefore, to the extent practicable and consistent with the provisions of this chapter, existing groundwater resources shall be preserved and protected and alternative sources of drinking water shall be made available.  In meeting these goals, the general court recognizes the connection between groundwater and surface water, the magnitude of the problem that must be resolved, the number of alternatives that may best provide safe drinking water including, but not limited to, on-site treatment and the expansion of drinking water infrastructure, and the resulting need for flexibility with respect to implementation of this chapter.  The general court hereby declares that the purpose of RSA 485-F is to provide for the protection, preservation, and enhancement of the drinking water and groundwater resources of the state.
