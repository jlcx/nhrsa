&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483-A:1 Statement of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
New Hampshire's lakes are one of its most important natural resources;  vital to wildlife, fisheries, recreation, tourism, and the quality of life of its citizens.  It is the policy of the state to insure the continued vitality of New Hampshire lakes as key biological, social, and economic assets, while providing that public health is ensured for the benefit of present and future generations.  The state shall encourage and assist in the development of management plans for the waters as well as the shoreland to conserve and protect valued characteristics, including recreational, aesthetic, and those of community significance, so that these valued characteristics shall endure as part of lake uses to be enjoyed by the citizens of New Hampshire.  If conflicts arise in the attempt to protect the valued characteristics of a lake, priority shall be given to those characteristics that are necessary to meet state water quality standards.
