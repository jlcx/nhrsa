&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 481:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that an adequate supply of water is indispensable to the health, welfare and safety of the people of the state and is essential to the balance of the natural environment of the state.  Further, the water resources of the state are subject to an ever-increasing demand for new and competing uses.  The general court declares and determines that the water of New Hampshire whether located above or below ground constitutes a limited and, therefore, precious and invaluable public resource which should be protected, conserved and managed in the interest of present and future generations.  The state as trustee of this resource for the public benefit declares that it has the authority and responsibility to provide careful stewardship over all the waters lying within its boundaries.  The maximum public benefit shall be sought, including the assurance of health and safety, the enhancement of ecological and aesthetic values, and the overall economic, recreational and social well-being of the people of the state.  All levels of government within the state, all departments, agencies, boards and commissions, and all other entities, public or private, having authority over the use, disposition or diversion of water resources, or over the use of the land overlying, or adjacent to, the water resources of the state, shall comply with this policy and with the state's comprehensive plan and program for water resources management and protection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 481:1-a Declaration of Need. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is declared that there is a statewide need for conservation and distribution of water and the regulation of the flow of rivers and streams, and for the development and promotion of hydro-energy resources, and that the public interest, welfare and necessity may, at times, require the construction of projects for the conservation, development, storage, distribution, and utilization of water and the operation of hydro-energy production facilities relying on water energy resources.  The department of environmental services shall be regarded as performing a governmental function in carrying out these provisions.  In carrying out the provisions and purposes of this chapter, the department of environmental services shall not, however, perform promotion activities which involve new or existing hydroelectric generation projects.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is further declared that there is a special public need for dams, reservoirs and hydro-energy production facilities at strategic locations for regulating the flow of rivers and streams to lessen damages resulting from floods and to promote the state's industrial and economic welfare by enhancing and utilizing the present and potential water power along the rivers and streams.  The construction, maintenance and operation of such dams, reservoirs and hydro-energy production facilities is the primary purpose of this chapter.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department, in order to make the project so far as possible self-liquidating and self-supporting, shall make contracts in the name of the department with persons or corporations as may be specially benefited by the project, including users of water in and outside the state for power or other purposes, covering the terms under which the persons or corporations shall pay for the benefits.  No contract shall extend for more than 50 years from the completion of the project.  The compensation for the use of stored water or other benefits created by the projects shall be made equitable as among different users.  All contracts shall benefit and bind the contracting users and their successors in title to the dams, water and flowage rights, generating plants, mills, or other real estate constituting the property on account of whose benefit the compensation is payable.  All contracts entered into by the department for the construction of a project or for the use of stored water must be approved by the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the department undertakes a project in which the electricity is to be generated at the dam or reservoir site, the department, for the purpose of making the project so far as possible self-liquidating and self-supporting, shall make contracts with developers or operators of the hydro-energy production facility as the department may determine to be best qualified or with such users or distributors of the mechanical or electrical power generated by the facility as the department may determine to best serve the interests of the state.  The contracts shall include terms under which the persons shall make full and proper restitution to the state.  No contract with an operator, user, or distributor of electrical or mechanical power shall extend for more than 50 years from the completion of the project.  All contracts with an operator, user, or distributor of mechanical or electrical power shall benefit and bind their successors in interest.  All contracts entered into by the department under this paragraph shall be subject to the approval of the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding paragraphs I and II, all contracts shall provide that in the event of a shortage crisis, as determined by the governor and council, in either the water resources of the state or the capacity to fulfill the electrical requirements of the state, the governor and council may suspend the terms of contracts which provide services outside of the state to fulfill the needs and requirements of the citizens of New Hampshire.

If the proceeding is brought by the department and such user files a disclaimer of any right to use stored water as defined in RSA 481:12, the petition shall be dismissed;  otherwise, the court, after hearing, shall determine the compensation for benefits justly payable by such user and enter a decree entitling him to make use of stored water subject to payment thereof and fixing the time and manner of such payment.  The compensation fixed by the decree shall not exceed the benefit resulting or to result to the user, shall be proportioned to the compensation payable by other users under existing contracts relative to the same project, and may be made payable in amortized or other installments in the same manner as the compensation provided for in such contracts, and the court, on proper application and notice, may subsequently modify or revise the decree as justice may require.  Any decree entered pursuant to this section and any subsequent modification or revision thereof shall inure to the benefit of and bind the user and his successors in title.

As used in this section, the term "stored water'' is defined as water released from storage provided under the terms hereof in excess of the amount which would naturally flow at the time of such release if storage facilities had not been so provided and maintained.  It shall be unlawful (1) for any person not entitled thereto under a contract as provided in RSA 481:8 or a judicial decree as provided in RSA 481:9 willfully to use for power or other purposes any stored water, or (2) for any person willfully to interfere with the flow of any stored water except so far as necessary in making a reasonable use of the same under such a contract or decree or a reasonable use of the natural flow in the exercise of his rights as a riparian or littoral proprietor, and any person, firm or corporation guilty of such unlawful use of or interference with the flow of stored water shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person, and each and every day of such unlawful use or interference shall be a separate offense.  The superior court sitting in equity shall have jurisdiction to enjoin the unlawful use of stored water and it shall be the duty of the attorney general to prosecute proceedings for the enforcement of the provisions hereof, but no criminal prosecution or proceeding for injunction with respect to the use of stored water shall be instituted or prosecuted under this section against a user who is a party to a petition under RSA 481:9 during the pendency of such petition.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 481:14 Tax Exemption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
All property and rights acquired by the department shall be exempt from all taxation, but the department shall continue to make payments in lieu of taxes, on or before December 1 of each year, to each town or city to which the department made such payments as of December 31, 2008.  Such sums shall be based on the tax rate then current in each town or city and on the average assessed valuation for a period of 5 years prior to the acquisition by the department;  provided that when those towns or cities shall have made a general revaluation of property for tax assessment purposes, then the new values shall be used for the determination of the sums as would have been assessed against the property and rights in such town or city if the same had been included in the tax invoice for such year.  Betterments, changes in land use or new structures are exempted and shall not be used for the determination of such sums to be paid in lieu of taxes.  Provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to the dam and any appurtenances thereto owned by the department and located in the towns of Pittsburg and Clarksville, and there shall be paid annually to said towns the sum of $40,000 in lieu of taxes, said sum to be apportioned between the towns in the same ratio that the value of that portion of the dam and any appurtenances thereto located in each town bears to the total value of the dam and any appurtenances thereto as determined by the tax assessors of the towns.
