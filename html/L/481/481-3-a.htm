&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 481:3-a Lease Program for Lake Francis. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It is the intent of the legislature to authorize a property leasing program, upon those lands under the jurisdiction of the department on the Lake Francis impoundment property.  The goal of the property leasing program is to make a solid contribution to the economic vitality of the Pittsburg-Clarksville region.  This policy is further designed to engender an appreciation for the appeal of northern New Hampshire for the people of New Hampshire.  To accomplish these goals the department shall establish and administer, upon the property of the Lake Francis impoundment area, a property leasing program as a responsibility secondary in priority to the ongoing water resource project of Lake Francis.  The department shall have the full authority, as is required, to organize a property leasing program which is compatible with its primary on-site water resource project.  The administration of the property leasing program shall be accomplished subject to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The present lessees shall be given first priority in leasing their present property under the new program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The term of the leases, subject to appropriate behavior as determined by the department, shall be 25 years and shall be renewable at the option of the lessee.  The rental payment shall be recalculated and adjusted no later than 5 years following its last determination.
