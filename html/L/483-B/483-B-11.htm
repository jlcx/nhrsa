&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise prohibited by law or applicable municipal ordinance, nonconforming structures located within the protected shoreland may be repaired, replaced in kind, reconstructed in place, altered, or expanded.  Repair, replacement-in kind, or reconstruction in place may alter or remodel the interior design or existing foundation of the nonconforming structure, but shall result in no expansion or relocation of the existing footprint within the waterfront buffer.  However, alteration or expansion of a nonconforming structure may expand the existing footprint within the waterfront buffer, provided the structure is not extended closer to the reference line and the proposal or property is made more nearly conforming than the existing structure or the existing conditions of the property.  This provision shall not allow for the enclosure, or conversion to living space, of any deck or open porch located between the primary structure and the reference line and within the waterfront buffer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, a proposal that is "more nearly conforming'' means alteration of the location or size of the existing footprints, or redevelopment of the existing conditions of the property, such that the structures or the property are brought into greater conformity with the design standards of this chapter.  Methods for achieving greater conformity include, without limitation, reducing the overall square footage of structural footprints, enhancing stormwater management, adding infiltration areas and landscaping, upgrading wastewater treatment, improving traffic management, or other enhancements that improve wildlife habitat or resource protection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An expansion that increases the sewerage load to an onsite septic system, or changes or expands the use of a septic system, shall require a subsurface approval issued by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Under paragraph I, and except as otherwise prohibited by law or applicable municipal ordinance, primary nonconforming structures may be entirely demolished and reconstructed, with continued encroachment into the waterfront buffer, provided the replacement structure is located farther back from the reference line than the preexisting nonconforming structure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding paragraphs I and IV, between the primary building line and the reference line, no alteration shall extend the structure closer to the public water, except that a deck or open porch extending a maximum of 12 feet towards the reference line may be added to nonconforming structures erected prior to July 1, 1994.
