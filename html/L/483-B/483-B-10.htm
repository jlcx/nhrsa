&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483-B:10 Nonconforming Lots of Record. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Nonconforming, undeveloped lots of record that are located within the protected shoreland shall comply with the following restrictions, in addition to any local requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except when otherwise prohibited by law, present and successive owners of an individual undeveloped lot may construct a single family residential dwelling and appurtenant accessory structures on it, notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter.  Conditions may be imposed which, in the opinion of the commissioner, more nearly meet the intent of this chapter, while still accommodating the applicant's rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Building on nonconforming lots of record shall be limited to single family residential structures and related facilities, including, but not limited to, appurtenant accessory structures such as walkways and driveways, and water dependent structures such as docks, piers, and breakwaters consistent with state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Consistent with RSA 674:39-a, a municipality shall not merge adjacent nonconforming lots in common ownership without the consent of the owner.
