<center><h2>CHAPTER 483-B<br>SHORELAND WATER QUALITY PROTECTION ACT</h2></center>
<center><h3>Section 483-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The shorelands of the state are among its most valuable and fragile natural resources and their protection is essential to maintain the integrity of public waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. A natural woodland buffer, consisting of trees and other vegetation located in areas adjoining public waters, functions to intercept surface runoff, wastewater, subsurface flow, and deeper groundwater flows from upland sources and to remove or minimize the effects of nutrients, sediment, organic matter, pesticides, and other pollutants and to moderate the temperature of the near-shore waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. Scientific evidence has confirmed that even small areas of impervious surface coverage can have deleterious impacts on water quality and the aesthetic beauty of our lakes and rivers if not properly contained or managed within each watershed.  These impacts are known to reduce recreational opportunity, reduce property values, and pose human health risks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The public waters of New Hampshire are valuable resources held in trust by the state.  The state has an interest in protecting those waters and has the jurisdiction to control the use of the public waters and the adjacent shoreland for the greatest public benefit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. There is great concern throughout the state relating to the utilization, protection, restoration and preservation of shorelands because of their effect on state waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Under current law the potential exists for uncoordinated, unplanned and piecemeal development along the state's shorelines, which could result in significant negative impacts on the public waters of New Hampshire.

<codesect>
To fulfill the state's role as trustee of its waters and to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare, the general court declares that the public interest requires the establishment of standards for the subdivision, use, and development of the shorelands of the state's public waters.  The development standards provided in this chapter shall be the minimum standards necessary to protect the public waters of the state of New Hampshire.  These standards shall serve to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources.
<br>

III. Prevent and control water pollution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Protect fish spawning grounds, aquatic life, and bird and other wildlife habitats.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Protect buildings and lands from flooding and accelerated erosion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Protect archaeological and historical resources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Protect commercial fishing and maritime industries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Protect freshwater and coastal wetlands.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Control building sites, placement of structures, and land uses that may potentially damage the public waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Conserve shoreline cover and points of access to inland and coastal waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Preserve the state's lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters in their natural state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Promote wildlife habitat, scenic beauty, and scientific study.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Protect public use of waters, including recreation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Conserve natural beauty and open spaces.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. Anticipate and respond to the impacts of development in shoreland areas to the extent they may potentially damage the public waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. Provide for economic development in proximity to waters.

(2) Within 14 days of the date of receipt of a written request from the applicant to issue the permit, the department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Approve the application, in whole or in part, and issue a permit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Deny the application and issue written findings in support of the denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the department does not issue either a permit or a written denial within the 14-day period, the applicant shall be deemed to have a permit by default and may proceed with the project as presented in the application.  The authorization provided by this subparagraph shall not relieve the applicant of complying with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter and RSA 485-A relating to water quality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Upon receipt of a written request from an applicant, the department shall issue written confirmation that the applicant has a permit by default pursuant to subparagraph (e)(3), which authorizes the applicant to proceed with the project as presented in the application and requires the work to comply with all requirements applicable to the project, including but not limited to requirements established in or under this chapter and RSA 485-A relating to water quality.

(f) All applications filed in accordance with the rules adopted by the department under RSA 483-B:17 and which meet the minimum standards of this chapter shall be approved and a permit shall be issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The department may extend the time for rendering a decision under subparagraphs (b)(3) and (c)(3), without the applicant's agreement, on an application from an applicant who previously has been determined, after the exhaustion of available appellate remedies, to have failed to comply with this chapter or any rule adopted or permit or approval issued under this chapter, or to have misrepresented any material fact made in connection with any activity regulated or prohibited by this chapter, pursuant to an action initiated under RSA 483-B:18.  The length of such an extension shall be no longer than reasonably necessary to complete the review of the application, and shall not exceed 30 days unless the applicant agrees to a longer extension.  The department shall notify the applicant of the length of the extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The department may suspend review of an application for a proposed project on a property with respect to which the department has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for any violation of this chapter, RSA 482-A, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44, or of any rule adopted or permit or approval issued pursuant to this chapter, RSA 482-A, RSA 485-A:17, or RSA 485-A:29-44.  Any such suspension shall expire upon conclusion of the enforcement action and completion of any remedial actions the department may require to address the violation;  provided, however, that the department may resume its review of the application sooner if doing so will facilitate resolution of the violation.  The department shall resume its review of the application at the point the review was suspended, except that the department may extend any of the time limits under this paragraph and its rules up to a total of 30 days for all such extensions.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "enforcement action'' means an action initiated under RSA 482-A:13, RSA 482-A:14, RSA 482-A:14-b, RSA 483-B:18, RSA 485-A:22, RSA 485-A:42, or RSA 485-A:43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The permit for which extension is sought has not been revoked or suspended without reinstatement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Extension would not violate a condition of law or rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The project is proceeding towards completion in accordance with plans and other documentation referenced by the permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Maintenance of a Waterfront Buffer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The waterfront buffer shall be those protected shorelands within 50 feet of the reference line.  The purpose of this buffer shall be to protect the quality of public waters while allowing homeowner discretion with regard to water access, safety, viewscape maintenance, and lot design.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Within the waterfront buffer all of the following prohibitions and limitations shall apply:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Rocks and stumps and their root systems shall be left intact in the ground unless removal is specifically approved by the department, pursuant to RSA 482-A or RSA 483-B:11, II or unless rocks are removed to improve runoff control or the planting in the waterfront buffer, and stumps that are removed are replaced with pervious surfaces, new trees, or other woody vegetation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) No natural ground cover shall be removed except as necessary for a foot path to water and access ways as provided under RSA 483-B:9, V(a)(2)(D), (viii) and (ix), for normal maintenance, to protect the waterfront buffer, cutting those portions that have grown over 3 feet in height for the purpose of providing a view, to provide access to natural areas or shoreline, or as specifically approved by the department, pursuant to RSA 482-A or RSA 483-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Starting from the northerly or easterly boundary of the property, and working along the shoreline, the waterfront buffer shall be divided into 50 by 50 foot segments.  Owners of land within the waterfront buffer shall measure, calculate, and maintain the tree, sapling, shrub, and groundcover point score in each of these segments in accordance with the methods and standards described in subparagraphs (i) through (ix).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Tree and sapling diameters shall be measured at 4 1/2 feet above the ground for existing trees and saplings, or by caliper at a height consistent with established nursery industry standards when nursery stock is to be used, and are scored as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Diameter or Caliper--Score
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1 to 3 inches--1
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Greater than 3 to and including 6 inches--5
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Greater than 6 to and including 12 inches--10
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Greater than 12 inches-- 15
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) For the purpose of planting under RSA 483-B:9, V(g)(3), shrubs and groundcover plants shall be scored as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Four square feet of shrub area--1 point.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Ground cover, not including mowed lawn--one point for every 50 square feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Shrub and groundcover shall count for at least 15 points and not more than 25 points in each full segment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) Dead, diseased, or unsafe trees or saplings shall not be included in scoring.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) If the total tree and sapling score in any 50 foot by 50 foot segment exceeds 50 points, then trees, saplings, and shrubs over 3 feet in height may be removed as long as the sum of the scores for the remaining trees and saplings in that segment does not total less than 50 points.  If for any reason there is insufficient area for a full segment, or the segment contains areas incapable of supporting trees and saplings, such as areas of rock, ledge, or beaches, the point score requirement for the remaining vegetation in that partial segment shall be reduced proportionally to that required of a full segment.  Vegetation shall not be removed from any segment which fails to meet the minimum point score for that segment.  Owners are encouraged to take efforts to plan the maintenance of their waterfront buffer areas including the planting of additional non-invasive vegetation to increase point scores within segments, thus providing sufficient points to allow the future removal of vegetation as may become necessary while still meeting the requirements of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(v) The department shall approve applications pursuant to RSA 482-A or RSA 483-B that include the planting of trees, saplings, shrubs, and groundcover as necessary to at least maintain either the existing point score or the minimum score required.  The department shall not approve any application that would result in a combined vegetation score of less than the minimum score required where the segment initially meets the minimum score or would result in any reduction of the point score where the segment does not initially meet the minimum score.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(vi) Owners of lots and holders of easements on lots that were legally developed prior to July 1, 2008 may maintain but not enlarge cleared areas, including but not limited to existing lawns, gardens, landscaped areas, beaches, and rights-of-way for public utilities, public transportation, and public access, and may repair existing utility structures within the waterfront buffer.  Conversion to or planting of cleared areas with non-invasive species of ground cover, shrubs, saplings, and trees is encouraged but shall not be required unless it is necessary to meet the requirements of subparagraph (g)(2) or (g)(3), or RSA 483-B:11, II.  In addition, the commissioner of the department of resources and economic development may order vegetation on lands or properties owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the control of the department of resources and economic development within the protected shoreland to be cut when overgrowth of vegetation impairs law enforcement activities and endangers public safety.  If such cutting will exceed that which is allowed under subparagraph (iv), the commissioner of the department of resources and economic development shall provide written notification to the department of environmental services identifying the areas to be cut and an explanation of the need for the cutting at least 2 weeks prior to the undertaking.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(vii) Normal trimming, pruning, and thinning of branches to the extent necessary to maintain the health of the planted area as well to protect structures, maintain clearances, and provide views is permitted provided such activity does not endanger the health of the plant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(viii) When necessary for the completion of construction activities permitted in accordance with RSA 483-B:6, a temporary 12-foot wide access path shall be allowed.  On those properties accessible only by water, this access path may be maintained provided it is stabilized with a surface that will infiltrate stormwater.  On other properties the access path shall be completely restored and replanted with vegetation upon completion of construction except as allowed under subparagraph (ix).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ix) A permanent 6-foot wide foot path as well as access to any docks, beaches, structures, existing open areas, and the water body, configured in a manner that will not concentrate storm water runoff or contribute to erosion, are allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Maintenance of a Natural Woodland Buffer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A natural woodland buffer shall be maintained within 150 feet of the reference line.  The first 50 feet of this buffer is designated the waterfront buffer and is subject to the additional requirements of subparagraph (a).  The purpose of the natural woodland buffer shall be to protect the quality of public waters by minimizing erosion, preventing siltation and turbidity, stabilizing soils, preventing excess nutrient and chemical pollution, maintaining natural water temperatures, maintaining a healthy tree canopy and understory, preserving fish and wildlife habitat, and respecting the overall natural condition of the protected shoreland.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2)(A) Within the natural woodland buffer of a given lot the vegetation, except lawn, within at least 25 percent of the area outside the waterfront buffer shall be maintained in an unaltered state or improved with additional vegetation.  Owners of lots legally developed or landscaped prior to July 1, 2008 that do not comply with this standard are encouraged to, but shall not be required to, increase the percentage of area to be maintained in an unaltered state.  The percentage of area maintained in an unaltered state on nonconforming lots shall not be decreased.  In addition, the commissioner of the department of resources and economic development may order vegetation on lands or properties owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the control of the department of resources and economic development within the protected shoreland to be cut when overgrowth of vegetation impairs law enforcement activities and endangers public safety.  If such cutting will exceed that which is allowed under this subparagraph, the commissioner of the department of resources and economic development shall provide written notification to the department of environmental services identifying the areas to be cut and an explanation of the need for the cutting at least 2 weeks prior to the undertaking.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Any person applying to the department for a septic system construction approval or alteration of terrain permit pursuant to RSA 485-A, or an excavating and dredging permit pursuant to RSA 482-A, within the protected shoreland shall include photographic documentation of any areas of the natural woodland buffer in which impacts would occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Dead, diseased, or unsafe, trees, limbs, saplings, or shrubs that pose a hazard to structures or have the potential to cause personal injury may be removed regardless of any requirements that pertain to the natural woodland buffer under this chapter.  Such exemptions shall not be used to contravene the intent of the law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Maintenance and preservation of dead and living trees that provide dens and nesting places for wildlife is encouraged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) Planting efforts that do not introduce exotic or invasive species and are beneficial to wildlife are encouraged.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Lots and residential units outside of the protected shoreland shall not be subject to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Minimum Lots and Non-Residential Development.  In the protected shoreland:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The minimum size for new non-residential lots in areas dependent upon on-site septic systems shall be determined by soil type lot size determinations, as set forth under rules adopted under RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) No lot having frontage on public water shall be created with less than 150 feet of shoreland frontage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Non-residential lots outside of the protected shoreland shall not be subject to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Impervious Surfaces.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) No more than 30 percent of the area of a lot located within the protected shoreland shall be composed of impervious surfaces, unless a stormwater management system designed and certified by a professional engineer is implemented.  Such system design shall demonstrate that the post-development volume and peak flow rate based on the 10-year, 24-hour storm event, shall not exceed the pre-development volume and peak flow rate for flow off the property within the protected shoreland.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the impervious surface area will exceed 20 percent, but is less than 30 percent, a stormwater management system shall be implemented and maintained which is designed to infiltrate increased stormwater from development occurring after the effective date of this paragraph in accordance with rules established by the department under RSA 485-A:17.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the impervious surface area will exceed 30 percent and the tree, sapling, shrub, and groundcover in the waterfront buffer does not meet the point score requirement of RSA 483-B:9, V(a)(2)(D) in any segment, then such segment shall be planted, as determined by rule of the department, with trees, saplings, shrubs, or groundcover in sufficient quantity, type, and location either to meet the minimum score or to provide at least an equivalent level of protection as provided by the minimum score and shall be maintained in accordance with RSA 483-B:9, V(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Common Owners and Residential or Non-Residential Development.  In the protected shoreland, waterfront parcels held in common by one or more owners of contiguous interior parcels may be developed, but only in a manner consistent with the provisions of this chapter.  Care shall be taken for the adequate provision of parking, toilet facilities, and related support systems to minimize the project's impact on the public waters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The commissioner shall have the authority to grant waivers from the minimum standards of this section.  Such authority shall be exercised if the commissioner deems that strict compliance with the minimum standards of this section will provide no material benefit to the public and have no material adverse effect on the environment or the natural resources of the state.  Waivers shall also be granted to accommodate the reasonable needs of persons with disabilities.

<codesect>
Nonconforming, undeveloped lots of record that are located within the protected shoreland shall comply with the following restrictions, in addition to any local requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except when otherwise prohibited by law, present and successive owners of an individual undeveloped lot may construct a single family residential dwelling and appurtenant accessory structures on it, notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter.  Conditions may be imposed which, in the opinion of the commissioner, more nearly meet the intent of this chapter, while still accommodating the applicant's rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Building on nonconforming lots of record shall be limited to single family residential structures and related facilities, including, but not limited to, appurtenant accessory structures such as walkways and driveways, and water dependent structures such as docks, piers, and breakwaters consistent with state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Consistent with RSA 674:39-a, a municipality shall not merge adjacent nonconforming lots in common ownership without the consent of the owner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483-B:11 Nonconforming Structures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise prohibited by law or applicable municipal ordinance, nonconforming structures located within the protected shoreland may be repaired, replaced in kind, reconstructed in place, altered, or expanded.  Repair, replacement-in kind, or reconstruction in place may alter or remodel the interior design or existing foundation of the nonconforming structure, but shall result in no expansion or relocation of the existing footprint within the waterfront buffer.  However, alteration or expansion of a nonconforming structure may expand the existing footprint within the waterfront buffer, provided the structure is not extended closer to the reference line and the proposal or property is made more nearly conforming than the existing structure or the existing conditions of the property.  This provision shall not allow for the enclosure, or conversion to living space, of any deck or open porch located between the primary structure and the reference line and within the waterfront buffer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, a proposal that is "more nearly conforming'' means alteration of the location or size of the existing footprints, or redevelopment of the existing conditions of the property, such that the structures or the property are brought into greater conformity with the design standards of this chapter.  Methods for achieving greater conformity include, without limitation, reducing the overall square footage of structural footprints, enhancing stormwater management, adding infiltration areas and landscaping, upgrading wastewater treatment, improving traffic management, or other enhancements that improve wildlife habitat or resource protection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An expansion that increases the sewerage load to an onsite septic system, or changes or expands the use of a septic system, shall require a subsurface approval issued by the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Under paragraph I, and except as otherwise prohibited by law or applicable municipal ordinance, primary nonconforming structures may be entirely demolished and reconstructed, with continued encroachment into the waterfront buffer, provided the replacement structure is located farther back from the reference line than the preexisting nonconforming structure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding paragraphs I and IV, between the primary building line and the reference line, no alteration shall extend the structure closer to the public water, except that a deck or open porch extending a maximum of 12 feet towards the reference line may be added to nonconforming structures erected prior to July 1, 1994.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 483-B:12 Shoreland Exemptions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governing body of a municipality may, in its discretion, request the commissioner to exempt all or a portion of the protected shoreland within its boundaries from the provisions of this chapter if the governing body finds that special local urbanization conditions as defined in RSA 483-B:4, XXV, exist in the protected shoreland for which the exemption is sought.
<br>

II. If the governing body of a municipality requests such an exemption, it shall submit evidence of existing and historical patterns of building and development in the protected shoreland in demonstration of the special local urbanization conditions.  Such evidence shall address:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Current and past building density.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Commercial, industrial, or residential uses.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any other information which the commissioner may reasonably require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. With the advice of the office of energy and planning, the commissioner shall approve or deny the request for an exemption and shall issue written findings in support of his decision.  A request for an exemption shall be approved only if the municipality demonstrates, using the evidence required under paragraph II, that special conditions of urbanization exist along the portion of shoreland to be exempted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The Pease development authority, division of ports and harbors may request an exemption under this section for all or a portion of any land purchased, leased, or otherwise acquired by it pursuant to RSA 12-G:39.
