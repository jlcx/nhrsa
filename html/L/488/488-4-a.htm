&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 488:4-a Measurement of Withdrawals for Snowmaking. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding RSA 488:4, water use associated with snowmaking shall be measured at the point water is withdrawn from any natural source of water for use by a snowmaking system and at the point that water is entering into the snowmaking system, and such water withdrawal and use shall be measured by an appropriate and calculable method such as a weir, stream gauge, meter, or a technically appropriate and calculable method utilizing the manufacturer's plated specifications as they relate to gallons of water pumped per minute.  Diversions from natural sources into storage reservoirs may be measured by using the measurement of the amount of water entering a snowmaking system and by calculating the change in the amount of water stored in the storage reservoir, provided separate records of the water withdrawn from each natural source are maintained.
