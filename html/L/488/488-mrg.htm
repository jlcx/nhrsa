<center><h3>Section 488:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 488:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
This chapter provides for uniform statewide collection of water use data to understand how water resources are utilized in the state by establishing procedures and standards for the registration, measurement, and reporting of water use.  The legislature recognizes the fundamental importance of water resources and intends to provide a framework to obtain and maintain basic water use data for the state.  The legislature recognizes that information describing the major water uses of the state along with assessing the amount of water in a given watershed or aquifer are integral to all water resource quantity assessments and management decisions.  Water use data is necessary to understand the effects of cumulative uses, transfers, discharges, and consumptive water losses in aquifers and watersheds in the state.  Water use data also identifies the quantity and timing of existing water uses, and this information can be used to estimate future water needs of the state.  Water use data is also necessary for verifying compliance with and equitable enforcement of state laws pertaining to groundwater and surface water.

<codesect>
Each withdrawal, discharge, or transfer required to be registered under this chapter shall be metered or measured by a technically appropriate and verifiable method approved by the commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 488:4-a Measurement of Withdrawals for Snowmaking. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding RSA 488:4, water use associated with snowmaking shall be measured at the point water is withdrawn from any natural source of water for use by a snowmaking system and at the point that water is entering into the snowmaking system, and such water withdrawal and use shall be measured by an appropriate and calculable method such as a weir, stream gauge, meter, or a technically appropriate and calculable method utilizing the manufacturer's plated specifications as they relate to gallons of water pumped per minute.  Diversions from natural sources into storage reservoirs may be measured by using the measurement of the amount of water entering a snowmaking system and by calculating the change in the amount of water stored in the storage reservoir, provided separate records of the water withdrawn from each natural source are maintained.
