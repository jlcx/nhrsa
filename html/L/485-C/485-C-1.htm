I. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the natural quality of the groundwater resource of the state by assisting local groundwater protection efforts and by establishing procedures and standards for the classification and remediation of groundwater and state permitting of large groundwater withdrawals.  The legislature recognizes the fundamental importance of the groundwater resource and the role of local planning and management in groundwater protection, and intends through this legislation to provide a framework for local groundwater protection.  The legislature also intends to provide for consistent, protective management and remediation of groundwater affected by regulated contaminants.  The natural quality of the groundwater resource shall be preserved and protected in order that groundwater may be used for drinking water supply.  Ambient groundwater quality standards shall meet drinking water standards, and the classification of groundwater shall provide opportunity for protecting groundwater of high value as a drinking water supply.  The legislature recognizes that groundwater constitutes an integral part of the hydrologic cycle and that the protection of groundwater quality is necessary to preserve the integrity of surface water.

II. The legislature finds that the most effective means of preserving the existing high quality of groundwater is by identification and careful management of operations or activities which may cause contamination of groundwater if not properly conducted.  Because groundwater is primarily a local resource, cities and towns should have the first opportunity to institute programs for groundwater protection within the scope of this chapter.  Suppliers of water should also have this opportunity because of their vital interest in preserving the quality of their groundwater supply.  The state, which has general responsibility for groundwater management in the public trust and interest, should develop groundwater protection programs within the scope of this chapter when such programs are not developed by a local entity.
