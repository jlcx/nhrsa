&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-C:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the natural quality of the groundwater resource of the state by assisting local groundwater protection efforts and by establishing procedures and standards for the classification and remediation of groundwater and state permitting of large groundwater withdrawals.  The legislature recognizes the fundamental importance of the groundwater resource and the role of local planning and management in groundwater protection, and intends through this legislation to provide a framework for local groundwater protection.  The legislature also intends to provide for consistent, protective management and remediation of groundwater affected by regulated contaminants.  The natural quality of the groundwater resource shall be preserved and protected in order that groundwater may be used for drinking water supply.  Ambient groundwater quality standards shall meet drinking water standards, and the classification of groundwater shall provide opportunity for protecting groundwater of high value as a drinking water supply.  The legislature recognizes that groundwater constitutes an integral part of the hydrologic cycle and that the protection of groundwater quality is necessary to preserve the integrity of surface water.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislature finds that the most effective means of preserving the existing high quality of groundwater is by identification and careful management of operations or activities which may cause contamination of groundwater if not properly conducted.  Because groundwater is primarily a local resource, cities and towns should have the first opportunity to institute programs for groundwater protection within the scope of this chapter.  Suppliers of water should also have this opportunity because of their vital interest in preserving the quality of their groundwater supply.  The state, which has general responsibility for groundwater management in the public trust and interest, should develop groundwater protection programs within the scope of this chapter when such programs are not developed by a local entity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-C:5 Classes of Groundwater. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All groundwater shall be classified for the purpose of prescribing protections and management practices.  These classifications do not necessarily reflect existing water quality.  For purposes of classification, all groundwater shall be assigned to one of 4 classes as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Class GAA groundwater shall be the most protected class.  Groundwater in this class is within the wellhead protection area for wells which presently are used or well sites which have been identified for future use as drinking water supply for public water systems.  An inventory of potential contamination sources in the wellhead protection area shall be conducted, and a management program shall be implemented as provided under RSA 485-C:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Class GA1 shall be assigned to groundwater in a defined zone of high value for present or future drinking water supply.  An inventory of potential contamination sources in the contributing area of this class shall be conducted, and a management program shall be implemented as provided under RSA 485-C:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Class GA2 shall be assigned to groundwater within aquifers identified as highly productive for potential use as a public water supply by the U.S. Geological Survey regional groundwater studies, or other regional studies.  Zones of stratified drift with a saturated thickness greater than 20 feet, and a transmissivity greater than 1,000 feet squared per day shall be designated as class GA2.  Zones of bedrock with average well yields greater than 50 gallons per minute shall also be designated as class GA2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Class GB shall be assigned to all groundwater not assigned to a higher class.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The land area vertically above shall be assigned to the highest class of groundwater beneath it, for purposes of managing potential contamination sources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 485-C:6 Ambient Groundwater Quality Standards. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall establish and adopt ambient groundwater quality standards for regulated contaminants which adversely affect human health or the environment.  Ambient groundwater standards shall apply to all regulated contaminants which result from human operations or activities, but do not apply to naturally occurring contaminants.  Where federal maximum contaminant level or health advisories have been promulgated under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act or rules relevant to such act, ambient groundwater quality standards shall be equivalent to such standards.  Where such standards are based upon cancer risks, the ambient groundwater quality standards shall be equivalent to that exposure which causes a lifetime exposure risk of one cancer in 1,000,000 exposed population.  Where no federal maximum contaminant level or health advisory has been issued, the commissioner may adopt ambient groundwater quality standards on a basis which provides for an adequate margin of safety to protect human health and safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Ambient groundwater quality standards shall be the water quality basis for issuance of groundwater discharge permits under RSA 485-A:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except for discharges of domestic wastewater regulated under RSA 485-A:13 and RSA 485-A:29, no person shall violate ambient groundwater quality standards.

(g) Development of an impact monitoring and reporting program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Identification of potential mitigation measures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-c. In order to preserve the public trust, no large groundwater withdrawal shall cause an unmitigated impact as determined by the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Reducing the withdrawal capacity of a private water supply well of a single residence as a result of the reduction of available water that is directly associated with the withdrawal as determined by the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Any reduction in capacity for wells with a capacity less than water well board recommended optimum minimum flow capacity of 4 gallons per minute for 4 hours before the withdrawal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any reduction in capacity below 4 gallons per minute for 4 hours, for wells that had a capacity greater than 4 gallons per minute for 4 hours, before the withdrawal;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A reduction in capacity where the well still has a capacity between 4 gallons and 10 gallons per minute for 4 hours and the user provides information indicating that the reduction in flow has resulted in the inability to meet his or her water needs;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Reducing the capacity of a public drinking water supply below the minimum withdrawal rates required per consumer determined by the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Minimum daily amounts of drinking water shall be determined per use based on the design flow criteria established for public water supply systems established in rules adopted by the department;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Where it is verified that such wells were unable to produce the design flow before the withdrawal began, the adverse impact shall be any reduction in the ability to produce water;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Reducing the capacity of a water supply that is used for a multiple unit dwelling residence, but that is not a public water supply, that results in the inability to continue established activities or maintain existing water capacity requirements;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Reducing the capacity of a private, non-residential, non-drinking water supply that results in the inability of a commercial, industrial, agricultural, or retail facility to continue established services or production volumes;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Reducing the ability of a registered water user to produce volumes equivalent to the average daily withdrawal for a specific calendar month as determined by discharge measurements and reports made to the department in accordance with the water user requirements under RSA 488 or other previous water use reporting requirements of the department;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Reducing surface water levels or flows that will, or do, cause a violation of surface water quality rules adopted by the department;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Causing a net loss of values for submerged lands under tidal and fresh waters and its wetlands as set forth in RSA 482-A;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Causing the inability of permitted surface water or groundwater discharges to meet permit conditions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Reducing river flows below acceptable levels established pursuant to RSA 483;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Causing the contamination of groundwater obtained from wells or surface waters from contaminated groundwater whose flow has been altered by the withdrawal, or causing the contamination of an aquifer or contributing to the spread of any existing contamination;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Causing the long-term predictable rate of replenishment of the aquifer that is the source of the withdrawal to be exceeded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-d. Terms and conditions of approval for a large groundwater withdrawal may be altered by the department to accommodate for drought conditions or new withdrawals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-e. Applications for large groundwater withdrawals shall be accompanied by an impact assessment of the potential impact area of the proposed withdrawal to demonstrate the preservation of the public trust as set forth in paragraph V-c.  The impact assessment shall include at a minimum the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The maximum extent of the cone of depression created by the withdrawal with the assumption of a conceptual hydrological model condition of 180 days of continuous pumping at maximum volumes without recharge from rainfall or snowmelt;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The maximum extent of the recharge area for the withdrawal with the assumption of a conceptual hydrologic model condition of 180 days of continuous pumping at maximum volumes without recharge from rainfall or snowmelt;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The downgradient area of the withdrawal which shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An existing or new delineation of a potential impact area large enough so that the size of the entire study area for the withdrawal is at least 10 times the size of the recharge area for the withdrawal;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) An existing or new delineation of a watershed where the amount of water crossing the downgradient boundary, that is, leaving the study under current conditions, is at least 10 times the amount to be withdrawn;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) An alternative method of estimating a potential impact area provided it relies on conservative assumptions, is demonstrated as appropriate for the site by test results, and is clearly explained and justified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Decisions of the department may be appealed in accordance with RSA 21-O:7, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any party shall have the right to appeal from the decision of the water council to the superior court of the county in which the large groundwater withdrawal is to be made to determine the validity and the reasonableness of the department's action on the permit.  The appeal shall be filed within 60 days after the decision of the water council.  The appeal shall suspend the decision of the department pending the outcome of a preliminary hearing.  The appeal, so far as practicable, shall have precedence over other actions in the same court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Records of public hearings shall be available pursuant to RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Before the department issues a large groundwater withdrawal permit, any municipality in which a well is sited or proposed to be sited, or any municipality within the potential impact area of the proposed withdrawal pursuant to paragraph V-e, may require the department to determine that the withdrawal will not infringe on the public's use of groundwater, including any contribution to wetlands and surface waters, by ensuring that the requirements of paragraph V-c are met.  The department's determination shall be based on substantial evidence and shall include the methods, evidence, and data it used to support its judgment.  After the department issues a large groundwater withdrawal permit, such municipality may require the department to provide a written finding describing the status of a decision issued by the department on an application submitted under this section when a local building permit directly related to a large groundwater withdrawal activity expires or becomes null and void, or both.  The department shall determine if the change in status of such local permit affects the decision the department made on the application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The department shall allow any municipality showing that it may be substantially and specifically affected by a proceeding under this chapter to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding and shall allow the municipality to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing or for any other purpose, as the department may order.  A municipality that intervenes before the department shall retain its status through any appeal of the department's decision.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department may approve a new large groundwater withdrawal without compliance with RSA 485-C:14, RSA 485-C:21, or RSA 485-C:22 to protect human health and the environment in the event that circumstances beyond the control of the person requesting the withdrawal occurs, such as fire, flood, drought, other acts of God, or infrastructure failure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A large groundwater withdrawal approved for emergency purposes under paragraph I shall only be allowed to operate for 2 years unless it is approved by the department in accordance with RSA 485-C:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No withdrawal that the department approves in accordance with paragraph I shall result in an unmitigated impact as described in RSA 485-C:21, V-c.  The department shall require that monitoring and mitigation plans be implemented when necessary to identify and mitigate the occurrence of such impacts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any party may appeal from the decision of the department to approve a withdrawal in accordance with paragraph I to the superior court of the county in which the large groundwater withdrawal is to be made to determine the validity and the reasonableness of the department's action.  The appeal shall be filed within 60 days after the approval of the department.
