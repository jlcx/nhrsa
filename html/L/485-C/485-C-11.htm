I. The department shall develop best management practices for the activities identified in RSA 485-C:7 as potential contamination sources, except those activities under RSA 485-C:7, II(j) which shall be subject to best management practices and the applicable provisions of RSA title XL, developed, administered and enforced by the New Hampshire department of agriculture, markets, and food.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Best management practices shall strike a reasonable balance between environmental, energy, and economic impacts.  These best management practices shall apply to all potential contamination source activities in the state.  In developing best management practices for an activity or type of activity over which another state agency has regulatory jurisdiction, the department shall consult with that agency, and may, through a memorandum of agreement, delegate to that agency the administration of best management practices.  Best management practices shall not be inconsistent with applicable state or federal rules and regulations concerning such activities or with the intent of this chapter.
