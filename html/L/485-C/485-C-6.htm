<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall establish and adopt ambient groundwater quality standards for regulated contaminants which adversely affect human health or the environment.  Ambient groundwater standards shall apply to all regulated contaminants which result from human operations or activities, but do not apply to naturally occurring contaminants.  Where federal maximum contaminant level or health advisories have been promulgated under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act or rules relevant to such act, ambient groundwater quality standards shall be equivalent to such standards.  Where such standards are based upon cancer risks, the ambient groundwater quality standards shall be equivalent to that exposure which causes a lifetime exposure risk of one cancer in 1,000,000 exposed population.  Where no federal maximum contaminant level or health advisory has been issued, the commissioner may adopt ambient groundwater quality standards on a basis which provides for an adequate margin of safety to protect human health and safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Ambient groundwater quality standards shall be the water quality basis for issuance of groundwater discharge permits under RSA 485-A:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except for discharges of domestic wastewater regulated under RSA 485-A:13 and RSA 485-A:29, no person shall violate ambient groundwater quality standards.
