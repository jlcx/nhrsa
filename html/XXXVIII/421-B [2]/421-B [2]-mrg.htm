<br><center>[RSA 421-B:2-202-A effective January 1, 2016.]</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:2-202-A Implementing Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Counting of purchasers.  The following principles shall be used to calculate the number of purchasers to whom sales of the issuer's securities are made pursuant to RSA 421-B:2-202(1) and RSA 421-B:2-202(14):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Exclusions.  The following purchasers shall be excluded:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Any relative, spouse, or relative of the spouse of a purchaser who has the same principal residence as such purchaser;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) Any individual retirement account for the benefit of a purchaser;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) Any trust or estate in which a purchaser or any of the persons related to such purchaser specified in subsection (1)(C) collectively have more than 50 percent of the beneficial interest (excluding contingent interests);  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) Any corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, business trust or other business entity in which a purchaser or any of the persons related to the purchaser specified in subsection (1)(C) collectively are the beneficial owners of more than 50 percent of the equity securities or equity interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Inclusions.  A purchaser shall be included in the calculation of the number of purchasers if such purchaser purchases a security which the issuer claims qualifies as a federal covered security under section 18(b)(4)(E) of the Securities Act of 1933 but in actuality does not so qualify.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Entity as purchaser.  A corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, business trust, or other business entity shall be counted as one purchaser.  However, if such entity is organized for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities offered and is not an investor specified in RSA 421-B:2-202(13), then each beneficial owner of equity interests or equity securities in such entity shall count as a separate purchaser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Employee benefit plan as purchaser.  A non-contributory employee benefit plan, within the meaning of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, shall be counted as one purchaser if the trustee makes all investment decisions for the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) Sales to certain clients or customers.  Sales to clients of an investment adviser, broker-dealer, or trust administered solely by a bank having fiduciary power, or persons with similar relationships, shall be considered as separate sales, regardless of the amount of discretion given to the investment adviser, broker-dealer, bank, or other person to act on behalf of the client, customer or trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) Joint or common ownership.  Sales to persons who acquire the securities as joint tenants, tenants in common, or tenants by the entirety shall be counted as a single purchaser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Integration of Offerings.  Offers and sales of securities that are made more than 6 months before the start of an offering or are made more than 6 months after completion of an offering will not be considered part of that offering, so long as during those 6-month periods there are no offers or sales of securities by or for the issuer that are of the same or a similar class as those offered and sold in such offering, other than offers or sales of securities under an employee benefit plan.  The determination of whether separate sales of securities are part of the same offering and are considered integrated depends on the particular facts and circumstances.  The following factors should be considered in determining whether offers and sales should be integrated for purposes of the exemption under RSA 421-B:2-202(14):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Whether the sales are part of a single plan of financing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Whether the sales involve issuance of the same class of securities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Whether the sales have been made at or about the same time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Whether the same type of consideration is being received;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) Whether the sales are made for the same general purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In connection with an offer and sale of exempt securities or in an exempt transaction, other than in connection with an offer and sale of federal covered securities, additional disclosures shall be made in offering documents, or an application for registration or a filing for exemption from registration shall be denied, or further conditions for an exemption may be imposed by the secretary of state, if any partner, officer, director, or a person having a similar status or performing a similar function:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) has been convicted within the previous 5 years of any felony involving fraud or deceit, including forgery, embezzlement, obtaining money under false pretenses, larceny, or conspiracy to defraud;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(E) is subject to a material administrative enforcement order or judgment which prohibits, denies or revokes the use of any exemption from registration in connection with the offer, purchase, or sale of securities;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(F) is currently subject to any order, judgment, or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction temporarily, preliminarily, or permanently restraining, or enjoining such person from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the purchase or sale of any security or involving the making of any false filing with the state entered within the previous 5 years.

If the deficiency is corrected, the stop order is void as of the time of its issuance and no penalty may be imposed by the secretary of state.  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the secretary of state from investigating and issuing a stop order suspending the offer and sale of a federal covered security for violation of RSA 421-B:5-501.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Filing fee.  A person filing a registration statement shall pay a filing fee.  If a registration statement is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective stop order is issued under RSA 421-B:3-306, the secretary of state shall retain such portion of the fee that the secretary of state deems equitable under the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Status of offering.  A registration statement filed under RSA 421-B:3-303 or RSA 421-B:3-304 must specify:

(1) the amount of securities to be offered in this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the states in which a registration statement or similar record in connection with the offering has been or is to be filed;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Incorporation by reference.  A record filed under this chapter or the predecessor act within 5 years preceding the filing of a registration statement may be incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent that the record is currently accurate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nonissuer distribution.  In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information or a record may not be required under subsection (i) or RSA 421-B:3-304, unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the person on whose behalf the distribution is to be made or unless it can be furnished by those persons without unreasonable effort or expense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Escrow and impoundment.  An order issued under this chapter may require as a condition of registration that a security issued within the previous 5 years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially less than the public offering price or to a person for a consideration other than cash be deposited in escrow;  and that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere.  The conditions of any escrow or impoundment required under subsection (f) may be established by order issued under this chapter, but the secretary of state may not reject a depository institution or trust company solely because of its location in another state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Form of subscription.  An order issued under this chapter may require as a condition of registration that a security registered under this chapter be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be filed under this chapter or preserved for a period specified by the rule or order, which may not be longer than 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Effective period.  Except while a stop order is in effect under RSA 421-B:3-306, a registration statement is effective for one year after its effective date, or for any longer period designated in an order under this chapter during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by an underwriter or broker-dealer that is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken as a participant in the distribution.  For the purposes of a nonissuer transaction, all outstanding securities of the same class identified in the registration statement as a security registered under this chapter are considered to be registered while the registration statement is effective.  If any securities of the same class are outstanding, a registration statement may not be withdrawn until one year after its effective date.  A registration statement may be withdrawn only with the approval of the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Periodic reports.  While a registration statement is effective, an order issued under this chapter may require the person that filed the registration statement to file reports, not more often than quarterly, to keep the information or other record in the registration statement reasonably current and to disclose the progress of the offering.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Posteffective amendments.  A registration statement may be amended after its effective date.  The posteffective amendment becomes effective when the secretary of state so orders.  If a posteffective amendment is made to increase the number of securities specified to be offered or sold, the person filing the amendment shall pay a registration fee.  A posteffective amendment relates back to the date of the offering of the additional securities being registered if, within one year after the date of the sale, the amendment is filed and the additional registration fee is paid.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:5-502 Prohibited Conduct in Providing Investment Advice. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Fraud in providing investment advice.  It is unlawful for any person that advises others for compensation, either directly or indirectly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or that, for compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports relating to securities:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) to employ a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud another person;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) to engage in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon another person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Supplemental provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) It shall constitute a fraudulent or deceptive act, practice, or course of business within the meaning of subsection (a) for any investment adviser registered or required to be registered to fail to disclose to any client or prospective client all material facts with respect to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) a financial condition of the investment adviser that is reasonably likely to impair the ability of the investment adviser to meet contractual commitments to clients, if the investment adviser has discretionary authority (express or implied) or custody over such client's funds or securities, or requires prepayment of advisory fees of more than $500 from such client, 6 months or more in advance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) a legal or disciplinary event that is material to an evaluation of the adviser's integrity or ability to meet contractual commitments to clients.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A person who is an investment adviser or investment adviser representative is a fiduciary and has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the person's clients.  While the extent and nature of this duty varies according to the nature of the relationship between an investment adviser and the clients and the circumstances of each case, an investment adviser or investment adviser representative shall not engage in unethical business practices which constitute violations of subsection (a), including the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Recommending to a client to whom investment supervisory, management, or consulting services are provided the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security without reasonable grounds to believe that the recommendation is suitable for the client on the basis of information furnished by the client after reasonable inquiry concerning the client's investment objectives, financial situation and needs, and any other information known by the investment adviser or investment adviser representative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Exercising any discretionary power in placing an order for the purchase or sale of securities for a client without obtaining written discretionary authority from the client within 10 business days after the date of the first transaction placed pursuant to oral discretionary authority, unless the discretionary power relates solely to the price at which, or the time when, an order involving a definite amount of a specified security shall be executed, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Introducing trading in a client's account that is excessive in size or frequency in view of the financial resources, investment objectives, and character of the account in light of the fact that an adviser in such situations can directly benefit from the number of securities transactions effected in a client's account.  Subsection (b)(2)(B) appropriately forbids an excessive number of transaction orders to be induced by an investment adviser or investment adviser representative for a client's account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) Placing an order to purchase or sell a security for the account of a client without the authority to do so.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(G) Loaning money to a client unless the investment adviser is a financial institution engaged in the business of loaning funds or the client is an affiliate of the investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(H) Misrepresenting to any advisory client, or prospective advisory client, the qualifications of the investment adviser, investment adviser representative, or any employee of the investment adviser, or misrepresenting the nature of the advisory services being offered or fees to be charged for such services, or omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made regarding qualifications, services or fees, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(I) Providing a report or recommendation to any advisory client prepared by someone other than the investment adviser or investment adviser representative without disclosing that fact.  This prohibition does not apply to a situation where the investment adviser or investment adviser representative uses published research reports or statistical analysis to render advice or where a representative orders such a report in the normal course of providing service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(J) Charging a client an unreasonable advisory fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(L) Guaranteeing a client that a specific result will be achieved, such as gain or no loss, with advice which will be rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(M) Publishing, circulating, or distributing any advertisement which does not comply with Rule 206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 17 C.F.R. 275.206(4)-1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(N) Disclosing the identity, affairs, or investments of any client unless required by law to do so, or unless consented to in writing by the client.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(O) Taking any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to those securities or funds in which any client has any beneficial interest, where the investment adviser or investment adviser representative has custody or possession of such securities or funds when the adviser's action is subject to and does not comply with the requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 17 C.F.R. 275.206(4)-2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(Q) Entering into, extending, or renewing any investment adviser contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client.

(b) apply to an investment advisory contract with a person (except a trust, governmental plan, collective trust fund, or separate account), provided that the contract relates to the investment of assets in excess of $1,000,000, if the contract provides for compensation based on the asset value of the company or fund under management averaged over a specified period and increasing and decreasing proportionately with the investment performance of the company or fund over a specified period in relation to the investment record of an appropriate index of securities prices or such other measure of investment performance as the secretary of state by rule may specify.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) Subsection (b)(2)(Q) shall not be deemed to prohibit an investment adviser from entering into, performing, renewing, or extending an investment advisory contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of the capital gains upon, or the capital appreciation of, the funds, or any portion of the funds, of a client, provided that the client entering into the contract subject to subsection (b)(2)(Q) is a qualified client defined as any one of the following persons:

(d) The secretary of state, upon his or her own motion, or by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or transaction, or any class or classes of persons or transactions, from subsection (b)(2)(Q), if and to the extent that the exemption relates to an investment advisory contract with any person that the secretary of state determines does not need the protections of subsection (b)(2)(Q), on the basis of such factors as financial sophistication, net worth, knowledge of and experience in financial matters, amount of assets under management, relationship with a registered investment adviser, and such other factors as the secretary of state determines are consistent with subsection (b)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br><center>[RSA 421-B:5-502-A effective January 1, 2016.]</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:5-502-A Custody of Client Funds or Securities by Investment Advisers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Safekeeping required.  It is unlawful and deemed to be a fraudulent or deceitful act, practice, or course of business for an investment adviser, registered or required to be registered, to have custody of client funds or securities unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Notice to secretary of state.  The investment adviser notifies the secretary of state promptly in writing that the investment adviser has or may have custody.  Such notification is required to be given on Form ADV;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Qualified custodian.  A qualified custodian maintains those funds and securities:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) in a separate account for each client under that client's name;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in accounts that contain only the investment adviser's clients' funds and securities, under the investment adviser's name as agent or trustee for the clients, or, in the case of a pooled investment vehicle that the investment adviser manages, in the name of the pooled investment vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Notice to clients.  If an investment adviser opens an account with a qualified custodian on its client's behalf, under the client's name, under the name of the investment adviser as agent, or under the name of a pooled investment vehicle, the investment adviser must notify the client in writing of the qualified custodian's name, address, and the manner in which the funds or securities are maintained, promptly when the account is opened and following any changes to this information.  If the investment adviser sends account statements to a client to which the investment adviser is required to provide this notice, the investment adviser must include in the notification provided to that client and in any subsequent account statement the investment adviser sends that client a statement urging the client to compare the account statements from the custodian with those from the investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Account statements.  The investment adviser has a reasonable basis, after due inquiry, for believing that the qualified custodian sends an account statement, at least quarterly, to each client for which it maintains funds or securities, identifying the amount of funds and the amount of each security in the account at the end of the period and setting forth all transactions in the account during that period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Special rule for limited partnerships and limited liability companies.  If the investment adviser or a related person is a general partner of a limited partnership (or managing member of a limited liability company, or holds a comparable position for another type of pooled investment vehicle), the account statements required under subsection (a)(4) must be sent to each limited partner (or member or other beneficial owner).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Independent verification.  The client funds and securities of which the investment adviser has custody are verified by actual examination at least once during each calendar year, by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to a written agreement between the investment adviser and the independent certified public accountant, at a time that is chosen by the independent certified public accountant without prior notice or announcement to the investment adviser and that is irregular from year to year.  The written agreement must provide for the first examination to occur within 6 months of becoming subject to subsection (a)(6), except that, if the investment adviser maintains client funds or securities pursuant to this section as a qualified custodian, the agreement must provide for the first examination to occur no later than 6 months after obtaining the internal control report.  The written agreement must require the independent certified public accountant to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) file a certificate on Form ADV-E with the secretary of state within 120 days of the time chosen by the independent certified public accountant in subsection (a)(6), stating that it has examined the funds and securities and describing the nature and extent of the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) notify the secretary of state within one business day of the finding of any material discrepancies during the course of the examination, by means of a facsimile transmission or electronic mail, followed by first class mail, directed to the attention of the secretary of state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) file within 4 business days of the resignation or dismissal from, or other termination of, the engagement, or removing itself or being removed from consideration for being reappointed, Form ADV-E accompanied by a statement that includes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The date of such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other termination, and the name, address, and contact information of the independent certified public accountant;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) An explanation of any problems relating to examination scope or procedure that contributed to such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Investment advisers acting as qualified custodians.  If the investment adviser maintains, or if the investment adviser has custody because a related person maintains, client funds or securities pursuant to this section as a qualified custodian in connection with advisory services the investment adviser provides to clients, the following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The independent certified public accountant the investment adviser retains to perform the independent verification required by subsection (a)(6) must be registered with, and subject to regular inspection as of the commencement of the professional engagement period, and as of each calendar year-end, by, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in accordance with its rules;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The investment adviser must obtain, or receive from its related person, within 6 months of becoming subject to subsection (a)(7) and thereafter no less frequently than once each calendar year a written internal control report prepared by an independent certified public accountant:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The internal control report must include an opinion of an independent certified public accountant as to whether controls have been placed in operation as of a specific date, and are suitably designed and are operating effectively to meet control objectives relating to custodial services, including the safeguarding of funds and securities held by either the investment adviser or a related person on behalf of the investment adviser's clients, during the year;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The independent certified public accountant must verify that the funds and securities are reconciled to a custodian other than the investment adviser or the investment advisers related person;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) The independent certified public accountant must be registered with, and subject to regular inspection as of the commencement of the professional engagement period, and as of each calendar year-end, by, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in accordance with its rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) Independent representatives.  A client may designate an independent representative to receive, on his or her behalf, notices and account statements as required under subsections (a)(3) and (a)(4).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Exceptions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Shares of open end mutual funds.  With respect to shares of an open end mutual fund, the investment adviser may use the open end mutual fund's transfer agent in lieu of a qualified custodian for purposes of complying with subsection (a);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Certain privately offered securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The investment adviser is not required to comply with subsection (a)(2) with respect to securities that are:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) acquired from the issuer in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) uncertificated and ownership thereof is recorded only on the books of the issuer or its transfer agent in the name of the client;  and transferable only with prior consent of the issuer or holders of the outstanding securities of the issuer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2)(A), subsection (b)(2) shall apply with respect to securities held for the account of a limited partnership (or limited liability company, or other type of pooled investment vehicle) only if the limited partnership is audited, and the audited financial statements are distributed, as described in subsection (b)(4) and the investment adviser notifies the secretary of state in writing that the investment adviser intends to provide audited financial statements, as described in subsection (a).  Such notification is required to be provided on Form ADV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Fee deduction.  Notwithstanding subsection (a)(6), an investment adviser is not required to obtain an independent verification of client funds and securities maintained by a qualified custodian if all of the following conditions are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The investment adviser has custody of the funds and securities solely as a consequence of its authority to make withdrawals from client accounts to pay its advisory fee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The investment adviser has written authorization from the client to deduct advisory fees from the account held with the qualified custodian;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Each time a fee is directly deducted from a client account, the investment adviser concurrently:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) sends the qualified custodian an invoice or statement of the amount of the fee to be deducted from the client's account;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) sends the client an invoice or statement itemizing the fee.  Itemization includes the formula used to calculate the fee, the amount of assets under management the fee is based on, and the time period covered by the fee;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) The investment adviser notifies the secretary of state in writing that the investment adviser intends to use the safeguards provided in subsection (b)(3).  Such notification is required to be given on Form ADV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Limited partnerships subject to annual audit.  An investment adviser is not required to comply with subsections (a)(3) and (a)(4) and shall be deemed to have complied with subsection (a)(6) with respect to the account of a limited partnership (or limited liability company, or another type of pooled investment vehicle) if each of the following conditions are met:

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Signed consent to service of process.  A consent to service of process required by this chapter must be signed and filed in the form required by the secretary of state.  A consent appointing the secretary of state the person's agent for service of process in a noncriminal action or proceeding against the person, or the person's successor, or personal representative under this chapter or an order issued by the secretary of state under this chapter after the consent is filed, has the same force and validity as if the service were made personally on the person filing the consent.  A person that has filed a consent complying with this subsection in connection with a previous application for registration or notice filing need not file an additional consent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Conduct constituting appointment of agent for service.  If a person, including a nonresident of this state, engages in an act, practice, or course of business prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or an order issued by the secretary of state under this chapter and the person has not filed a consent to service of process under subsection (a), that act, practice, or course of business constitutes the appointment of the secretary of state as the person's agent for service of process in a noncriminal action or proceeding against the person, the person's successor, or personal representative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Procedure for service of process.  Service under subsection (a) or (b) may be made by providing a copy of the process to the office of the secretary of state, but it is not effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the plaintiff, which may be the secretary of state, promptly sends notice of the service and a copy of the process, return receipt requested, to the defendant or respondent at the address set forth in the consent to service of process or, if a consent to service of process has not been filed, at the last known address, or takes other reasonable steps to give notice;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the plaintiff files an affidavit of compliance with this subsection in the action or proceeding on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within the time that the court, or the secretary of state, in a proceeding before the secretary of state, allows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Use in administrative proceedings.  Service as provided in subsection (c) may be used in a proceeding before the secretary of state or by the secretary of state in a civil action in which the secretary of state is the moving party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Provision of opportunity to defend.  If the process is served under subsection (c), the court, or the secretary of state in a proceeding before the secretary of state, shall order continuances as are necessary or appropriate to afford the defendant or respondent reasonable opportunity to defend.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(v) Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a written decision stating the action to be taken by the department and may set forth findings of fact, conclusions of law, and disposition.  All decisions shall be reached upon the basis of a preponderance of the evidence.  The decision of the presiding officer shall be construed as the decision of the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(w) Any party to whom notice has been forwarded pursuant to and in accordance with this section who fails to appear shall have a default judgment rendered against him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(x) The presiding officer may take judicial notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(y) Where the interests of justice will be better served without prejudice to the substantial rights of any party, a presiding officer may sever one case from another or may consolidate 2 or more cases, preserving to all parties the right of appeal from the single or several decisions rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(z) Once a hearing notice has been issued commencing an adjudicatory proceeding, no party shall communicate with the presiding officer or the secretary of state concerning the merits of the case except upon notice to all parties nor shall any party cause another person to make such communications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(aa) Within 30 days after a final decision, any party may file a motion for reconsideration which shall serve as a petition for rehearing under RSA 541.  No distinctions shall be made between the terms "reconsideration'' and "rehearing.''  A motion for reconsideration shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Identify each error of law, error of reasoning, or erroneous conclusion contained in the final order which the moving party wishes the secretary of state to reconsider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Concisely state the correct factual finding, correct reasoning, and correct conclusion being advocated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Include any memorandum of law the petitioner wishes to submit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(bb) Within 30 days after a final decision, the presiding officer may reconsider, revise or reverse any final action on the presiding officer's own motion.  If reconsideration is based upon the existing record, prior notice shall not be given to the parties.  If the presiding officer believes further information or argument should be considered, the parties shall be provided with an appropriate notice and opportunity to be heard before any revision is made in the previous action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(cc) The filing of a motion for reconsideration shall not operate as a stay of any order or decision, but a motion for stay may be combined with a motion for reconsideration.
