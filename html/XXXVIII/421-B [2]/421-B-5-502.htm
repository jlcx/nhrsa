<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Fraud in providing investment advice.  It is unlawful for any person that advises others for compensation, either directly or indirectly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or that, for compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports relating to securities:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) to employ a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud another person;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) to engage in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon another person.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) Supplemental provisions.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) It shall constitute a fraudulent or deceptive act, practice, or course of business within the meaning of subsection (a) for any investment adviser registered or required to be registered to fail to disclose to any client or prospective client all material facts with respect to:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(A) a financial condition of the investment adviser that is reasonably likely to impair the ability of the investment adviser to meet contractual commitments to clients, if the investment adviser has discretionary authority (express or implied) or custody over such client's funds or securities, or requires prepayment of advisory fees of more than $500 from such client, 6 months or more in advance;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(B) a legal or disciplinary event that is material to an evaluation of the adviser's integrity or ability to meet contractual commitments to clients.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) A person who is an investment adviser or investment adviser representative is a fiduciary and has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the person's clients.  While the extent and nature of this duty varies according to the nature of the relationship between an investment adviser and the clients and the circumstances of each case, an investment adviser or investment adviser representative shall not engage in unethical business practices which constitute violations of subsection (a), including the following:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(A) Recommending to a client to whom investment supervisory, management, or consulting services are provided the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security without reasonable grounds to believe that the recommendation is suitable for the client on the basis of information furnished by the client after reasonable inquiry concerning the client's investment objectives, financial situation and needs, and any other information known by the investment adviser or investment adviser representative.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(B) Exercising any discretionary power in placing an order for the purchase or sale of securities for a client without obtaining written discretionary authority from the client within 10 business days after the date of the first transaction placed pursuant to oral discretionary authority, unless the discretionary power relates solely to the price at which, or the time when, an order involving a definite amount of a specified security shall be executed, or both.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(C) Introducing trading in a client's account that is excessive in size or frequency in view of the financial resources, investment objectives, and character of the account in light of the fact that an adviser in such situations can directly benefit from the number of securities transactions effected in a client's account.

This prohibition does not apply to a situation where the investment adviser or investment adviser representative uses published research reports or statistical analysis to render advice or where a representative orders such a report in the normal course of providing service.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(J) Charging a client an unreasonable advisory fee.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(K) Failing to disclose to clients in writing before any advice is rendered any material conflict of interest relating to the investment adviser, investment adviser representative, or any of its employees which could reasonably be expected to impair the rendering of unbiased and objective advice. including:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(i) Compensation arrangements connected with advisory services to clients which are in addition to compensation from such clients or such services;  and<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(ii) Charging a client an advisory fee for rendering advice when a commission for executing securities transactions pursuant to such advice will be received by the adviser or its employees.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(L) Guaranteeing a client that a specific result will be achieved, such as gain or no loss, with advice which will be rendered.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(M) Publishing, circulating, or distributing any advertisement which does not comply with Rule 206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 17 C.F.R. 275.206(4)-1.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(N) Disclosing the identity, affairs, or investments of any client unless required by law to do so, or unless consented to in writing by the client.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(O) Taking any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to those securities or funds in which any client has any beneficial interest, where the investment adviser or investment adviser representative has custody or possession of such securities or funds when the adviser's action is subject to and does not comply with the requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 17 C.F.R. 275.206(4)-2.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(P) Entering into, extending, or renewing any investment adviser contract unless such contract is in writing and discloses, in substance, the services to be provided, the term of the contract, the advisory fee, the formula for computing the fee, the amount of prepaid fee to be returned in the event of contract termination or non-performance, whether the contract grants discretionary power to the investment adviser or investment adviser representative, and that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the investment adviser without the written consent of the other party to the contract.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Q) Entering into, extending, or renewing any investment adviser contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(i) Subsection (b)(2)(Q) shall not:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) be construed to prohibit an investment advisory contract which provides for compensation based upon the total value of a fund averaged over a definite period, or as of definite dates, or taken as of a definite date;
