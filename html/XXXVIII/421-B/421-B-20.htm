&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:20 Unlawful Representations Concerning Registration or Exemption. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Neither the fact that a registration statement or an application for a license has been filed under this chapter with the state of New Hampshire nor the fact that a security is effectively registered or a person is licensed in the state of New Hampshire constitutes a finding by the secretary of state that any document filed under RSA 421-B is true, complete and not misleading.  Neither any such fact nor the fact that an exemption or exception is available for a security or a transaction means that the secretary of state has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of, or recommended or given approval to, any person, security, or transaction.  It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The full text of paragraph I shall be reproduced, in type no smaller than 12 point boldface type, on any one of the first 5 pages of any prospectus or other offering document, when offered to New Hampshire residents in a private offering.  Public offerings shall bear either a legend approved by the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc., such as the modified Federal Regulation S-K legend or the legend required on Form U-7 which is required for offerings not federally registered.  This paragraph shall not apply to offers and sales of federal covered securities.
