&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:25 Civil Liabilities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who sells a security in violation of RSA 421-B:11 or 421-B:20, I or of any condition imposed under RSA 421-B:14, IV or RSA 421-B:15, V, VI and VII, is liable to the person purchasing the security from him, who may sue either in equity for rescission upon tender of the security or at law for damages if he no longer owns the security.  In any action for rescission, the purchaser shall be entitled to recover the consideration paid for the security together with interest at the legal rate, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees, less the amount of any income received on the securities.  In an action at law, damages shall be the consideration paid for the security together with interest at the legal rate to the date of disposition, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees, less the value of the security at the date of disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who violates RSA 421-B:3 in connection with the purchase or sale of any security shall be liable to any person damaged by the violation of that section who sold such security to him or to whom he sold such security, and any person who violates RSA 421-B:5 in connection with the purchase or sale of any security shall be liable to any person damaged by the conduct proscribed by RSA 421-B:5.  Any person who violates RSA 421-B:4 in connection with the purchase or sale of any security shall be liable to any investment advisory client of his who is damaged by the violation of that section.  Damages in an action pursuant to this paragraph shall include the actual damages sustained plus interest from the date of payment or sale, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under paragraph I or II, every partner, principal executive officer, or director of such person, every person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, every employee of such person who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation, and every broker-dealer or agent who materially aids in the acts or transactions constituting the violation, are also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such person.  There is contribution as in cases of contract among the several persons so liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No person shall be liable under paragraphs I and III who shall sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment.  Tender by a purchaser shall require only notice of willingness to exchange the security for the amount computed pursuant to paragraph I.  Tender by a seller shall require only notice of willingness to pay the amount specified in exchange for the security.  Any notice may be given by service as in civil actions or by certified mail to the last known address of the person liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every cause of action under this chapter survives the death of any person who might have been a plaintiff or defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A person may not recover under this section in actions commenced more than 6 years after his first payment of money to the broker-dealer or issuer in the contested transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. No purchaser may commence an action under paragraph I if, before suit is commenced, the purchaser has received a written offer to repurchase the security for cash payable on delivery of the security equal to the consideration paid, together with interest at the legal rate from the date of payment, less the amount of any income received on the security or, if the purchaser no longer owns the security, an offer to pay an amount in cash equal to the damages computed in accordance with paragraph I and the purchaser has failed to accept such offer in writing within 30 days of its receipt.  No offer shall be effective to prevent suit under this section unless a duplicate copy thereof shall have been filed with the secretary of state at least 20 days prior to its delivery to the offeree and the secretary of state shall not have objected to the offer within that time.  The offer shall be in the form and contain the information the secretary of state by rule or order prescribes.  If the offer is not performed in accordance with its terms, suit by the offeree under this section shall be permitted without regard to this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. No person who has made or engaged in the performance of any contract in violation of any provision of this section or any rule or order under this section or has acquired any purported rights under any such contract with knowledge of the facts by reason of which its making or performance was in violation may base any suit on such violation under the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Any condition, stipulation or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter in the purchase or sale of any security is void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The rights and remedies promulgated by this chapter are in addition to any other right or remedy that may exist at law or in equity, but this chapter does not create any cause of action not specified in this section or RSA 421-B:8, V.  No civil cause of action may be based solely upon the failure of a broker-dealer or agent to comply with the requirements of RSA 421-B:6, I or III, except a cause of action arising under RSA 421-B:23.
