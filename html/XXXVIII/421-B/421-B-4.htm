&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:4 Advisory Activities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is unlawful for any person who receives any consideration from another person primarily for advising the other person as to the value of securities or their purchase or sale whether through the issuance of analyses or reports or otherwise:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud another person;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the other person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is unlawful for any investment adviser or investment adviser agent to enter into, extend, or renew any investment advisory contract the terms of which are in contravention of such rules as the secretary of state may adopt as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is unlawful for any investment adviser or investment adviser agent to take or have custody of any securities or funds of any client in contravention of such rules as the secretary of state may adopt as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. It shall constitute a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of business within the meaning of paragraph I for any investment adviser or investment adviser agent who has custody or possession of any funds or securities in which any client has any beneficial interest, to do any act or take any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to any such funds or securities, unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All such securities of each such client are segregated, marked to identify the particular client who has the beneficial interest therein, and held in safekeeping in some place reasonably free from risk of destruction or other loss;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) All such funds of such clients are deposited in one or more bank accounts which contain only clients' funds, such account or accounts are maintained in the name of the investment adviser as agent or trustee for such clients, and the investment adviser maintains a separate record for each such account which shows the name and address of the bank where such account is maintained, the dates and amounts of deposits in and withdrawals from such account, and the exact amount of each client's beneficial interest in such account;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Such investment adviser, immediately after accepting custody or possession of such funds or securities from any client, notifies such client in writing of the place and manner in which such funds and securities will be maintained, and thereafter, if and when there is any change in the place or manner in which such funds or securities are being maintained, gives each such client written notice thereof;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Such investment adviser sends to each client, not less frequently than once every 3 months, an itemized statement showing the funds and securities in the custody or possession of the investment adviser at the end of such period, and all debits, credits, and transactions in such client's account during such period;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) (1) All such funds and securities of clients are verified by actual examination at least once during each calendar year by an independent public accountant at a time that shall be chosen by such accountant without prior notice to the investment adviser.  A certificate of such accountant stating that an examination of such funds and securities has been made, and describing the nature and extent of the examination, shall be attached to a completed Form ADV-E (17 C.F.R. 279.8) and transmitted to the secretary of state promptly after each examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subparagraph IV(e)(1) shall not apply to an investment adviser also registered as a broker-dealer under section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if (i) such broker-dealer is subject to and in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 (Reg. 240.15c3-1, 25,126) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or (ii) such broker-dealer is a member of an exchange whose members are exempt from Rule 15c3-1 (Reg. 240.15c3-1, 25,126) under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) thereof, and such broker-dealer is in compliance with all rules and settled practices of such exchange imposing requirements with respect to financial responsibility and the segregation of funds or securities carried for the account of customers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) (1) Direct deduction (automatic payment) of investment adviser fees from a client account to the investment adviser does not constitute custody of client funds if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The client provides written authorization permitting the adviser's fees to be paid directly from the client's account held by an independent custodian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The adviser sends to the client and the custodian at the same time, a bill showing the amount of the fee, the value of the client's assets on which the fee was based, and the specific manner in which the adviser's fee was calculated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The custodian agrees to send to the client a statement, at least quarterly, indicating all amounts disbursed from the account including the amount of advisory fees paid directly to the advisers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Absent any of the conditions in subparagraphs(f)(1)(A)-(C), the adviser is deemed to have custody of client funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. It shall constitute a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of business within the meaning of paragraph I for any investment adviser licensed or required to be licensed to fail to disclose to any client or prospective client all material facts with respect to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A financial condition of the adviser that is reasonably likely to impair the ability of the adviser to meet contractual commitments to clients, if the adviser has discretionary authority (express or implied) or custody over such client's funds or securities, or requires prepayment of advisory fees of more than $500 from such client, 6 months or more in advance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A legal or disciplinary event that is material to an evaluation of the advisers integrity or ability to meet contractual commitments to clients.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A person who is an investment adviser or investment adviser agent is a fiduciary and has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the person's clients.  While the extent and nature of this duty varies according to the nature of the relationship between an investment adviser and the clients and the circumstances of each case, an investment adviser or investment adviser agent shall not engage in unethical business practices which constitute violations of paragraph I, including the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Recommending to a client to whom investment supervisory, management, or consulting services are provided the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security without reasonable grounds to believe that the recommendation is suitable for the client on the basis of information furnished by the client after reasonable inquiry concerning the client's investment objectives, financial situation and needs, and any other information known by the investment adviser or investment adviser agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Exercising any discretionary power in placing an order for the purchase or sale of securities for a client without obtaining written discretionary authority from the client within 10 business days after the date of the first transaction placed pursuant to oral discretionary authority, unless the discretionary power relates solely to the price at which, or the time when, an order involving a definite amount of a specified security shall be executed, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Introducing trading in a client's account that is excessive in size or frequency in view of the financial resources, investment objectives, and character of the account in light of the fact that an adviser in such situations can directly benefit from the number of securities transactions effected in a client's account.  This subparagraph appropriately forbids an excessive number of transaction orders to be induced by an investment adviser or investment adviser agent for a client's account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Placing an order to purchase or sell a security for the account of a client without the authority to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Placing an order to purchase or sell a security for the account of a client upon instruction of a third party without first having obtained a written third party trading authorization from the client.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Borrowing money or securities from a client unless a client is a broker-dealer, an affiliate of the investment adviser, or a financial institution engaged in the business of loaning funds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Loaning money to a client unless the investment adviser is a financial institution engaged in the business of loaning funds or the client is an affiliate of the investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Misrepresenting to any advisory client, or prospective advisory client, the qualifications of the investment adviser, investment adviser agent, or any employee of the investment adviser, or misrepresenting the nature of the advisory services being offered or fees to be charged for such services, or omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made regarding qualifications, services or fees, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Providing a report or recommendation to any advisory client prepared by someone other than the investment adviser or investment adviser agent without disclosing that fact.  This prohibition does not apply to a situation where the investment adviser or investment adviser agent uses published research reports or statistical analysis to render advice or where an adviser orders such a report in the normal course of providing service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Charging a client an unreasonable advisory fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Failing to disclose to clients in writing before any advice is rendered any material conflict of interest relating to the investment adviser, investment adviser agent, or any of its employees which could reasonably be expected to impair the rendering of unbiased and objective advice including:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Compensation arrangements connected with advisory services to clients which are in addition to compensation from such clients or such services;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Charging a client an advisory fee for rendering advice when a commission for executing securities transactions pursuant to such advice will be received by the adviser or its employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Guaranteeing a client that a specific result will be achieved, such as gain or no loss, with advice which will be rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) Publishing, circulating, or distributing any advertisement which does not comply with Rule 206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) Disclosing the identity, affairs, or investments of any client unless required by law to do so, or unless consented to in writing by the client.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(o) Taking any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to those securities or funds in which any client has any beneficial interest, where the investment adviser or investment adviser agent has custody or possession of such securities or funds when the adviser's action is subject to and does not comply with the requirements of Reg. 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(p) Entering into, extending, or renewing any investment adviser contract unless such contract is in writing and discloses, in substance, the services to be provided, the term of the contract, the advisory fee, the formula for computing the fee, the amount of prepaid fee to be returned in the event of contract termination or non-performance, whether the contract grants discretionary power to the investment adviser or investment adviser agent, that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the investment adviser without the written consent of the other party to the contract, or that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client except that this subparagraph shall not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Be construed to prohibit an investment advisory contract which provides for compensation based upon the total value of a fund averaged over a definite period, or as of definite dates, or taken as of a definite date;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Apply to an investment advisory contract with a person (except a trust, governmental plan, collective trust fund, or separate account), provided that the contract relates to the investment of assets in excess of $1,000,000, if the contract provides for compensation based on the asset value of the company or fund under management averaged over a specified period and increasing and decreasing proportionately with the investment performance of the company or fund over a specified period in relation to the investment record of an appropriate index of securities prices or such other measure of investment performance as the secretary of state by rule may specify.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) shall not be deemed to prohibit an investment adviser from entering into, performing, renewing or extending an investment advisory contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of the capital gains upon, or the capital appreciation of, the funds, or any portion of the funds, of a client, provided that the client entering into the contract subject to this section is a qualified client defined as:

(B) A natural person who or a company that the investment adviser entering into the contract (and any person acting on his behalf) reasonably believes, immediately prior to entering into the contract, either:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) An employee of the investment adviser (other than an employee performing solely clerical, secretarial or administrative functions with regard to the investment adviser) who, in connection with his or her regular functions or duties, participates in the investment activities of such investment adviser, provided that such employee has been performing such functions and duties for or on behalf of the investment adviser, or substantially similar functions or duties for or on behalf of another company for at least 12 months.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The secretary of state, by rule, upon his or her own motion, or by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or transaction, or any class or classes of persons or transactions, from subparagraph (1), if and to the extent that the exemption relates to an investment advisory contract with any person that the secretary of state determines does not need the protections of subparagraph (1), on the basis of such factors as financial sophistication, net worth, knowledge of and experience in financial matters, amount of assets under management, relationship with a licensed investment adviser, and such other factors as the secretary of state determines are consistent with this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(q) Failing to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information in violation of section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(r) Entering into, extending, or renewing any advisory contract which would violate section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules promulgated thereunder.  This provision shall apply to all investment advisers and investment adviser agents licensed or required to be licensed under this chapter.
<br>
