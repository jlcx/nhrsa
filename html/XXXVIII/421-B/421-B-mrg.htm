&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is unlawful for any investment adviser or investment adviser agent to take or have custody of any securities or funds of any client in contravention of such rules as the secretary of state may adopt as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. It shall constitute a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of business within the meaning of paragraph I for any investment adviser or investment adviser agent who has custody or possession of any funds or securities in which any client has any beneficial interest, to do any act or take any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to any such funds or securities, unless:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A financial condition of the adviser that is reasonably likely to impair the ability of the adviser to meet contractual commitments to clients, if the adviser has discretionary authority (express or implied) or custody over such client's funds or securities, or requires prepayment of advisory fees of more than $500 from such client, 6 months or more in advance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A legal or disciplinary event that is material to an evaluation of the advisers integrity or ability to meet contractual commitments to clients.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A person who is an investment adviser or investment adviser agent is a fiduciary and has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the person's clients.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Introducing trading in a client's account that is excessive in size or frequency in view of the financial resources, investment objectives, and character of the account in light of the fact that an adviser in such situations can directly benefit from the number of securities transactions effected in a client's account.  This subparagraph appropriately forbids an excessive number of transaction orders to be induced by an investment adviser or investment adviser agent for a client's account.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Misrepresenting to any advisory client, or prospective advisory client, the qualifications of the investment adviser, investment adviser agent, or any employee of the investment adviser, or misrepresenting the nature of the advisory services being offered or fees to be charged for such services, or omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made regarding qualifications, services or fees, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Providing a report or recommendation to any advisory client prepared by someone other than the investment adviser or investment adviser agent without disclosing that fact.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(o) Taking any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to those securities or funds in which any client has any beneficial interest, where the investment adviser or investment adviser agent has custody or possession of such securities or funds when the adviser's action is subject to and does not comply with the requirements of Reg. 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) shall not be deemed to prohibit an investment adviser from entering into, performing, renewing or extending an investment advisory contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of the capital gains upon, or the capital appreciation of, the funds, or any portion of the funds, of a client, provided that the client entering into the contract subject to this section is a qualified client defined as:

<center><h3>Section 421-B:6</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:6 Licensing Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is unlawful for any person to transact business in this state as a broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, investment adviser, or agent unless such person is licensed under this chapter.  Except with respect to advisers whose only clients are those described in RSA 421-B:2, IX(f), it is unlawful for any federal covered adviser to conduct advisory business in this state unless such person complies with the provisions of RSA 421-B:7, I-b.  An investment adviser representative is required to be licensed as an agent under this section, in addition to any agent license held as a representative of any broker-dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. In connection with an offering of securities made pursuant to section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act of 1933 that requires only a notice filing in this state pursuant to RSA 421-B:11, I-a(e), a completed application for licensure as an issuer-dealer, an agent of an issuer-dealer and for an agent of the issuer, or authorization without licensure for an officer or director described in RSA 421-B:2, II(e), shall be filed with the secretary of state no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in or from this state, and the license or authorization will become effective without further action or review by the secretary of state.  Provided that the application is complete and accompanied by the appropriate fees, the effective date of the license or authorization shall for all purposes be the date of first sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. The issuer-dealer applications referred to in paragraph I-a shall set forth and be limited to the name of the issuer, the state of the issuer's formation, a description of the securities sold, the date of first sale of such securities in or from this state, the name or names of the representative or representatives of the issuer who are engaged in the sale of the securities, and confirmation that no agent has been convicted of a felony.  The applications need only be signed by that person or those persons who are authorized to do so by the issuer's board of directors or other governing body.  At the same time, the issuer shall submit a consent to service of process pursuant to RSA 421-B:30, VII, and shall pay the fees required by RSA 421-B:31.  Each application shall be on a form prescribed by the secretary of state, consistent with the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is unlawful for any broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, and investment adviser to employ an agent unless the agent is licensed, or for a federal covered adviser to employ, supervise, or associate with an investment adviser representative having a place of business located in this state, unless such investment adviser representative is licensed as an agent under this chapter, or is exempt from the licensing requirements.  Under this chapter, an agent's license is only in effect when such agent is associated with a particular broker-dealer, investment adviser, federal covered adviser, issuer-dealer, or a particular issuer.  No agent shall at any time represent more than one broker-dealer or issuer-dealer, except that where broker-dealers or issuer-dealers affiliated by direct common control are licensed under this chapter, an agent may represent any such broker-dealer or issuer-dealer.  When an agent begins or terminates those activities that make the person an agent, the broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, federal covered adviser, and investment adviser shall promptly notify the secretary of state.  When an investment adviser representative begins or terminates employment with a federal covered adviser, the investment adviser representative shall promptly notify the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. No person shall be issued an issuer-dealer license unless at least one person engaged in offering securities for sale on behalf of the issuer-dealer is licensed as an issuer-dealer agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All licenses for agents, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and issuer-dealers or notice filings for federal covered advisers shall expire every year on December 31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. A federal covered adviser who has paid a notice filing fee in this state for a particular calendar year and subsequently during that year becomes a state regulated investment adviser licensed in this state, shall not be assessed an additional fee (initial license fee) as it makes the transition to a licensed investment adviser in that year.  A state regulated investment adviser who has paid a license fee in this state for a particular calendar year and subsequently during that year becomes a federal covered adviser, shall not be assessed an additional fee (notice filing fee) for the transition to a federal covered adviser in that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All licensed agents, broker-dealers, investment advisers, federal covered advisers, and issuer-dealers and any persons applying for such licenses shall be liable for the fees established pursuant to RSA 421-B:31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Prior to opening or closing a branch office in this state, a broker-dealer or investment adviser shall send written notification directly to the secretary of state of the location of the branch office, telephone number, name of the individual supervising the office, the date of the opening or closing, and any other pertinent information required by the secretary of state.

(2) If more than one business enterprise is conducted from a branch office location, disclosures shall clearly set forth the name of each business enterprise, what business activity is conducted by each organization, and each licensed agent's relationship to each organization;  provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to television, radio, or billboard advertising that pertains exclusively to a non-securities product.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c)(1) Each broker-dealer branch office within this state shall be supervised by a manager who is a licensed agent in New Hampshire and who shall have qualified as a principal by passing a National Association of Securities Dealers principal's examination applicable to the licensee's business conducted at that location.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Each broker-dealer and investment adviser shall establish and maintain supervisory procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with all applicable securities laws and statutes.  The responsibility for such supervisory procedure shall be determined by various factors, including but not limited to:

(G) The disciplinary history of its agents and investment adviser representatives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Sales of securities made pursuant to qualified pension plans, qualified profit-sharing plans, and dividend reinvestment plans.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII-b.

The prohibited use of such certifications or professional designation includes, but is not limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(c) In determining whether a combination of words or an acronym standing for a combination of words constitutes a certification or professional designation indicating or implying that a person has special certification or training in advising or servicing senior citizens or retirees, factors to be considered shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Use of one or more words such as "senior,'' "retirement,'' "elder,'' or like words, combined with one or more words such as "certified,'' "registered,'' "chartered,'' "adviser,'' "specialist,'' "consultant,'' "planner,'' or like words, in the name of the certification or professional designation;  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The manner in which those words are combined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The consent to service of process for investment adviser applicants shall consist of the appropriate execution page of the Form ADV.  The application shall be on a form prescribed by the secretary of state and shall contain whatever information the secretary of state requires concerning such matters as, but not limited to, the applicant's form and place of organization;  the applicant's proposed method of doing business;  the qualifications and business history of the applicant;  in the case of a broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, or investment adviser, the qualifications and business history of any partner, officer, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, or investment adviser;  and, in the case of an investment adviser, Form ADV, specimens of investment adviser contracts, and the qualifications and business history of any employee;  any injunction or administrative order or conviction of a misdemeanor involving a security or any aspect of the securities business and any conviction of a felony;  and the applicant's financial condition and history.

If no denial order is in effect and no proceeding is pending under RSA 421-B:10, licensing becomes effective at noon of the thirtieth day after an application is filed.  The secretary of state may by rule or order specify an earlier effective date, and may by order defer the effective date until noon of the thirtieth day after filing of any amendment.

The following additional conditions relate to such electronic filings:

(b) Solely for purposes of a filing made through IARD, a document is considered filed with the secretary of state when all fees are received and the filing is accepted by IARD on behalf of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) (1) Any documents or fees required to be filed with the secretary of state that are not permitted to be filed with or cannot be accepted by IARD shall be filed directly with the secretary of state.  The application shall not be complete until all documents and fees required by this chapter and rules adopted thereunder have been submitted through the IARD, where possible, or submitted to and received directly by the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The following documents shall be required to be filed directly with the secretary of state:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Investment advisers licensed or required to be licensed under this chapter who experience unanticipated technical difficulties that prevent submission of an electronic filing to IARD may request a temporary hardship exemption from the requirements to file electronically.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The temporary hardship exemption will be deemed effective upon receipt by the secretary of state of the complete Form ADV-H.  Multiple temporary hardship exemption requests within the same calendar year may be disallowed by the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Continuing hardship exemption:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) A continuing hardship exemption shall be granted only if the investment adviser is able to demonstrate that the electronic filing requirements of this rule are prohibitively burdensome.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) To apply for a continuing hardship exemption, the investment adviser shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) An exemption is effective upon approval by the secretary of state.  The time period of the exemption may be no longer than one year after the date on which the Form ADV-H is filed.  If the secretary of state approves the application, the investment adviser shall, no later than 5 business days after the exemption approval date, submit filings to IARD in paper format (along with the appropriate processing fees) for the period of time for which the exemption is granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The decision to grant or deny a request for a hardship exemption shall be made by the administrator where the investment adviser's principal place of business is located, which decision shall be followed by the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) (1) An investment adviser shall file with IARD, in accordance with the instructions in the Form ADV, any amendments to the investment adviser's Form ADV.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) (1) By June 30, 2001, each investment adviser licensed or required to be licensed under this chapter shall resubmit its Form ADV electronically (if it has not previously done so) with IARD unless it has been granted a hardship exemption under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the amendment to Form ADV is made after June 30, 2001, or at an earlier date if an investment adviser has filed its Form ADV (17 CFR 279.1), or any amendments to Form ADV, electronically with IARD, the licensee shall file amendments to Form ADV required by this paragraph electronically with IARD, unless it has been granted a hardship exemption under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) By June 30, 2001, for each investment adviser representative licensed or required to be licensed under this chapter, Form U-4 must be resubmitted electronically if it has not previously been done with IARD, unless the investment adviser, filing on behalf of the investment adviser representative, has been granted a hardship exemption under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. Except with respect to federal covered advisers whose only clients are those described in RSA 421-B:2, IX(f), a federal covered adviser shall file with the secretary of state or his or her designee, prior to acting as a federal covered adviser in this state, a notice, which shall consist of a copy of the most recent complete Form ADV filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a Form U-2, and shall pay initial and annual fees in accordance with RSA 421-B:31.

Federal covered advisers shall submit copies to the secretary of state of all documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the securities laws within 10 business days of their submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Documents and fees that are accepted by IARD may be submitted through IARD.  Other documents filed or deemed filed with the SEC shall be submitted directly to the secretary of state.  Until IARD provides for the filing of Part 2 of Form ADV, the secretary of state shall deem filed Part 2 of Form ADV if a federal covered adviser provides, within 5 days of a request, Part 2 of Form ADV to the secretary of state.  Because the secretary of state deems Part 2 of the Form ADV to be filed, a federal covered adviser is not required to submit Part 2 of Form ADV to the secretary of state unless requested.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Neither the secretary of state nor any examiner shall remove any record, account, document, file or other property of the person being examined from the offices or place of such person except with the written consent of such person in advance of such removal or pursuant to an order of court duly obtained.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The following provisions govern the application of RSA 421-B:10, I(b)(9):
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The secretary of state may not enter an order against a broker-dealer on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than the broker-dealer himself if he is an individual, or an agent of the broker-dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The secretary of state may not enter an order against an investment adviser on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than the investment adviser himself if he is an individual, or any other person who represents the investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make him an investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The secretary of state may not enter an order solely on the basis of lack of experience if the applicant or licensee is qualified by training or knowledge or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The secretary of state may consider that an agent who will work under the supervision of a licensed broker-dealer need not have the same qualifications as a broker-dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The secretary of state may consider that an investment adviser is not necessarily qualified solely on the basis of experience as a broker-dealer or agent.  When he finds that an applicant for initial or renewal licensing as a broker-dealer is not qualified as an investment adviser, he may by order condition the applicant's license as a broker-dealer upon his not transacting business in this state as an investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The secretary of state may by rule provide for an examination which may be written or oral or both, to be taken by any class of or all applicants, as well as persons who represent or will represent an investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make him an investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The secretary of state may issue an order requiring the person to whom any license has been granted to show cause why the license should not be revoked.  The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the time and place for the revocation hearing, and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The secretary of state may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license pending final determination of any order to show cause, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided he finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the secretary of state shall promptly notify the applicant or licensee, as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or licensee is an agent, that it has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 days after the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing.  If the person to whom an order to show cause is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 days of receipt of such order, and none is ordered by the secretary of state, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the secretary of state, for good cause shown.  If a hearing is requested or ordered, the secretary of state, after notice of and opportunity for hearing, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  After the hearing, the secretary of state shall enter an order making such disposition of the matters as the facts require.  If the person to whom the license was granted fails to appear at a hearing of which he has been duly notified, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be determined against him upon consideration of the order to show cause, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  The secretary of state may adopt rules of procedure concerning all proceedings conducted pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the secretary of state finds that any licensee or applicant for license is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, agent, or investment adviser, or is subject to an adjudication of mental incompetence or to the control of a committee, conservator, or guardian, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the secretary of state may by order revoke the license or deny the application.  The secretary of state may deem abandoned and withdrawn any application for licensure made pursuant to this chapter, if any applicant fails to respond in writing within 90 days to a written request from the secretary of state requesting a response.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Withdrawal of a license as a broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, agent, or investment adviser becomes effective 30 days after receipt of an application to withdraw or within such shorter period of time as the secretary of state may determine, unless a revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the application is filed or a proceeding to revoke or suspend or to impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within 30 days after the application is filed.  If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the secretary of state by order determines.  If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the secretary of state may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under RSA 421-B:10, I(b)(2) within one year after withdrawal became effective and enter a revocation or suspension order as of the last date on which registration was effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In lieu of, or in addition to, any such order to suspend or revoke any license or application, the secretary of state may, upon hearing, assess an administrative fine of not more than $2,500 per violation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:15 Provisions Applicable to Registration Generally. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A registration statement may be filed with the secretary of state by the issuer, any other person on whose behalf the offering is to be made, or a licensed broker-dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every registration statement shall specify:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount of securities to be offered in this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The states in which a registration statement or similar document in connection with the offering has been or is to be filed;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any adverse order, judgment, or decree entered in connection with the offering by the regulatory authorities in each state or by any court or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. (a) Issuers of securities registered under this chapter shall provide quarterly financial reports within 60 days of the end of each quarter to their shareholders, partners, and members.  Such quarterly reports need not be independently audited.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The requirements of subparagraph (a) shall not apply to issuers of securities required to file reports pursuant to section 13 or section 15 of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any document filed under this chapter or a predecessor chapter within 5 years preceding the filing with the secretary of state of a registration statement may be incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent that the document is currently accurate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The secretary of state may by rule or otherwise permit the omission of any item of information or document from any registration statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The secretary of state may by rule or order require as a condition of registration by qualification or coordination:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That any security issued within the past 3 years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially different from the public offering price, or to any person for a consideration other than cash, be deposited in escrow;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The secretary of state may by rule or order determine the conditions of any escrow or impounding required under this section, but he may reject a depository solely because of location in another state only if the offering is not being registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the principal place of business of the registrant is in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The secretary of state may by rule or order require as a condition of registration that any security registered by qualification or coordination be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract, and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be filed with the secretary of state or preserved for any period up to 3 years specified in the rule or order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Every registration statement shall be effective, for the purpose of any non-issuer distribution until withdrawn, suspended, or revoked.  All outstanding securities of the same class as a registered security are considered to be registered for the purpose of any non-issuer transaction so long as the registration statement is effective.  A registration statement may not be withdrawn for one year from its effective date if any securities of the same class are outstanding.  With respect to non-issuer sales of covered securities under section 18(b)(4)(A) of the Securities Act of 1933, refer to RSA 421-B:11 and RSA 421-B:31, I(h).

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A registration statement relating to a security issued by a face amount certificate company or a redeemable security issued by an open-end management company or unit investment trust, as those terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be amended after its effective date so as to increase the securities specified as proposed to be offered.  Such an amendment becomes effective when the secretary of state so orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. So long as a registration statement is effective the secretary of state may require an issuer to file with him an annual report in such form as the secretary of state by rule prescribes.  Failure to file the annual report within 30 days after its request may be deemed a request for withdrawal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. No registration shall be deemed to be filed with the secretary of state until the fee established pursuant to RSA 421-B:31 has been paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The secretary of state may, as an alternative means of registration under RSA 421-B:12, 421-B:13 or 421-B:14, register securities by means of or through the facilities of a national organization which facilitates securities registration on a nationwide basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:16 Denial, Suspension, and Revocation of Registration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The secretary of state may issue a stop order denying effectiveness to, or suspending or revoking the effectiveness of, any registration statement if he finds:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the order is in the public interest;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That any of the following are true:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The registration statement as of its effective date or as of any earlier date in the case of an order denying effectiveness, or any amendment under RSA 421-B:15, X, as of its effective date, or any report under RSA 421-B:15, XI is incomplete in any material respect or contains any statement which was, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any provision of this chapter or any rule lawfully imposed under this chapter has been willfully violated, in connection with the offering, by
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The person filing the registration statement,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The issuer, any partner, officer, or director of the issuer, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, but only if the person filing the registration statement is directly or indirectly controlled by or acting for the issuer, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) Any underwriter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The security registered or sought to be registered is the subject of an administrative stop order or similar order or a permanent or temporary injunction of any court of competent jurisdiction entered under any other federal or state act applicable to the offering;  but the secretary of state may not institute a proceeding against an effective registration statement under this numbered subparagraph more than one year from the date of the order or injunction relied on, and may not enter an order under this numbered subparagraph on the basis of an order or injunction entered under any other state law unless that order or injunction was based on facts which would currently constitute a ground for a stop order under this numbered subparagraph;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The issuer's enterprise or method of business includes or would include activities which are illegal where performed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The offering has worked or tended to work a fraud upon purchasers or would so operate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) The offering has been or would be made with unreasonable amounts of underwriters' and sellers' discounts, commissions, or other compensation, or promoters' profits or participation, or unreasonable amounts or kinds of options;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Except with respect to securities which are being registered by notification the terms of the securities are unfair and inequitable;  provided, however, that the secretary of state may not determine that an offering is unfair and inequitable solely on the grounds that the securities are to be sold at an excessive price where the offering price has been determined by arms length negotiation between nonaffiliated parties.  The selling price of any security being sold by a broker-dealer licensed in this state shall be presumed to have been determined by arms length negotiation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) When a security is sought to be registered by notification and it is not eligible for such registration;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(9) When a security is sought to be registered by coordination, there has been a failure to comply with the undertaking required by RSA 421-B:13, II(d);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(10) The applicant or registrant has failed to pay the proper filing fee;  but the secretary of state may enter only a denial order under this numbered subparagraph and he shall vacate any such order when the deficiency has been corrected;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(11) The secretary of state may not institute a stop-order proceeding against an effective registration statement on the basis of a fact or transaction known to him when the registration statement became effective unless the proceeding is instituted within the next 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The secretary of state may issue an order requiring the person for whom a registration was made to show cause why the registration should not be revoked.  The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the time and place for the revocation hearing, and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The secretary of state may by order summarily suspend a registration pending final determination of any order to show cause, provided the secretary of state finds the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  If the registration is suspended pending final determination of any order to show cause, a hearing on the merits shall be held within 10 days of the issuance of the order or suspension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The secretary of state may issue a stop order suspending the offer and sale of a federal covered security, except a covered security under section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, if the secretary of state finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The order is in the public interest;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) There is a failure to comply with any condition established under sections RSA 421-B:2, 421-B:11, or 421-B:31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the rules adopted for the purposes of this chapter.  After the hearing, the secretary of state shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the person for whom the registration was made fails to appear at a hearing of which he has been duly notified, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be determined against him upon consideration of the order to show cause, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  The secretary of state may adopt rules of procedure concerning all proceedings conducted pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The secretary of state may vacate or modify a stop order if he finds that the conditions which prompted entry have changed or that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.

The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the time and place for the revocation hearing, and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order.  The secretary of state may by order summarily suspend, deny or revoke an exemption pending final determination of any order to show cause, provided the secretary of state finds the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such an order.  If an exemption is denied, revoked or suspended pending final determination of an order to show cause, a hearing on the merits shall be held within 10 days of the issuance.  The secretary of state may deem abandoned and withdraw any filing made pursuant to this section, if any person fails to respond in writing within 90 days, to a written request from the secretary of state requesting a response.

The secretary of state may adopt rules of procedure concerning all proceedings conducted pursuant to this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In any judicial or administrative proceeding under this chapter, the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it.

It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever it appears to the secretary of state that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The secretary of state shall have the power to issue and cause to be served upon such person an order requiring the person to cease and desist from violations of this chapter.  The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the rights of the person to request a hearing on the order and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order.  The order shall be served at the last known address of such person.  Service of the order and publication of the order in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the last known address of such person shall serve to duly notify the person of the order and of the right to a hearing on the order.  A hearing shall be held not later than 10 days after the request for such hearing is received by the secretary of state after which and within 20 days of the date of the hearing the secretary of state shall issue a further order vacating the cease and desist order or making it permanent as the facts require.  All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, such person shall be deemed in default, and the proceeding may be determined against him or her upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt of such order, but in any case no later than 60 calendar days from the issuance of the order, then such person shall likewise be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day from the receipt of the order and no later than the sixty-first day from the issuance of the order, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the secretary of state, for good cause shown.  The secretary of state may adopt rules of procedure concerning all proceedings conducted pursuant to this section;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The attorney general or secretary of state or his or her designee may, with or without prior administrative action by the secretary of state, bring an action in the superior court to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted.  In addition, the court may issue an order for other appropriate or ancillary relief, to include an asset freeze, accounting, writ of attachment, writ of general or specific execution, and an appointment of a receiver or conservator, that may be the administrator, for the defendant or the defendant's assets.  The court shall not require the attorney general or secretary of state to post a bond;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The attorney general or secretary of state or his or her designee may bring an action for injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations of any provision of this chapter.  In any action brought by the attorney general or secretary of state or his or her designee, the civil penalties shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation in the case of knowing violations, or $2,500 for each violation in the case of negligent violations, and each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation.  The action may be brought in the superior court of the county in which the defendant resides or has his or her principal place of business, or, with the consent of the parties or if the defendant is a nonresident and has no place of business within the state, in the superior court of Merrimack county.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In a proceeding in superior court under this section where the state prevails, the secretary of state and the attorney general shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses of investigation, and the court shall include the costs in its final judgment.

In any action for rescission, the purchaser shall be entitled to recover the consideration paid for the security together with interest at the legal rate, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees, less the amount of any income received on the securities.  In an action at law, damages shall be the consideration paid for the security together with interest at the legal rate to the date of disposition, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees, less the value of the security at the date of disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who violates RSA 421-B:3 in connection with the purchase or sale of any security shall be liable to any person damaged by the violation of that section who sold such security to him or to whom he sold such security, and any person who violates RSA 421-B:5 in connection with the purchase or sale of any security shall be liable to any person damaged by the conduct proscribed by RSA 421-B:5.

Damages in an action pursuant to this paragraph shall include the actual damages sustained plus interest from the date of payment or sale, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees.

III. Every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under paragraph I or II, every partner, principal executive officer, or director of such person, every person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, every employee of such person who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation, and every broker-dealer or agent who materially aids in the acts or transactions constituting the violation, are also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such person.  There is contribution as in cases of contract among the several persons so liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No person shall be liable under paragraphs I and III who shall sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment.  Tender by a purchaser shall require only notice of willingness to exchange the security for the amount computed pursuant to paragraph I.  Tender by a seller shall require only notice of willingness to pay the amount specified in exchange for the security.  Any notice may be given by service as in civil actions or by certified mail to the last known address of the person liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every cause of action under this chapter survives the death of any person who might have been a plaintiff or defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A person may not recover under this section in actions commenced more than 6 years after his first payment of money to the broker-dealer or issuer in the contested transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. No purchaser may commence an action under paragraph I if, before suit is commenced, the purchaser has received a written offer to repurchase the security for cash payable on delivery of the security equal to the consideration paid, together with interest at the legal rate from the date of payment, less the amount of any income received on the security or, if the purchaser no longer owns the security, an offer to pay an amount in cash equal to the damages computed in accordance with paragraph I and the purchaser has failed to accept such offer in writing within 30 days of its receipt.  No offer shall be effective to prevent suit under this section unless a duplicate copy thereof shall have been filed with the secretary of state at least 20 days prior to its delivery to the offeree and the secretary of state shall not have objected to the offer within that time.  The offer shall be in the form and contain the information the secretary of state by rule or order prescribes.  If the offer is not performed in accordance with its terms, suit by the offeree under this section shall be permitted without regard to this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. No person who has made or engaged in the performance of any contract in violation of any provision of this section or any rule or order under this section or has acquired any purported rights under any such contract with knowledge of the facts by reason of which its making or performance was in violation may base any suit on such violation under the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Any condition, stipulation or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter in the purchase or sale of any security is void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The rights and remedies promulgated by this chapter are in addition to any other right or remedy that may exist at law or in equity, but this chapter does not create any cause of action not specified in this section or RSA 421-B:8, V.  No civil cause of action may be based solely upon the failure of a broker-dealer or agent to comply with the requirements of RSA 421-B:6, I or III, except a cause of action arising under RSA 421-B:23.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) May be recorded unless all parties wish to discuss possible settlements off the record.  Such recordings shall be part of the record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A prehearing conference or other informal conference shall be conducted in person or, with the consent of the parties, shall be conducted by means of electronic communications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. The presiding officer shall cause the administrative hearing to be electronically recorded.  Such recording shall be made available, upon written request by a party and upon a fee sufficient to reimburse the full cost of providing the tape, or a true and accurate copy of such tape or tapes.  A party may request, in writing, a transcript of the hearing but shall first pay the full costs for such transcription as determined by the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. In the event there is a clear dispute of facts between the parties in which credibility of testimony will determine the outcome of the hearing, the presiding officer on his own motion or that of a party, may sequester witnesses until they are called to testify.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. In any administrative hearing in which administrative action affecting the rights or privileges of any party may be taken, an oath or affirmation shall be administered by the presiding officer to each witness prior to receiving testimony, provided, however, that if a witness asserts an objection to the taking of an oath for religious or other related reasons, an affirmation shall be administered.  Once a witness has been sworn at any hearing, it shall not be necessary to swear the witness again for subsequent testimony on the same day and in the same case.  The record of the proceeding shall indicate that a person was recalled to testify and reminded that such person was still under oath or affirmation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIX. Motions shall be in written form unless presented at the hearing.  Written motions shall be included in the record of the proceeding and filed together with the case file.  Oral motions shall be recorded in full in any transcript of the proceeding or, at the discretion of the presiding officer, noted in the minutes of the proceeding and submitted in written form within a reasonable time.  A presiding officer may rule upon a motion when made or may defer decision until a later time in the hearing, or until after the conclusion of the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XX. Administrative hearings shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, nor by technical or formal rules of procedure.  All relevant, material, and reliable evidence shall be admissible.  Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to, depositions, affidavits, official documents, and testimony of witnesses.  Provided, however, the presiding officer may, in the presiding officer's discretion, exclude any irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or unduly cumulative or repetitious evidence.  Applicable statutory and constitutional provisions and immunities requiring exclusion of evidence in civil proceedings shall be recognized, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit a party from waiving such party's privilege or immunity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXI. Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a written decision stating the action to be taken by the department and may set forth findings of fact, conclusions of law, and disposition.  All decisions shall be reached upon the basis of a preponderance of the evidence.  The decision of the presiding officer shall be construed as the decision of the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXII. Any party to whom notice has been forwarded pursuant to and in accordance with these rules who fails to appear shall have a default judgment rendered against him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXIII. The presiding officer may take judicial notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXIV. Where the interests of justice will be better served without prejudice to the substantial rights of any party, a presiding officer may sever one case from another or may consolidate 2 or more cases, preserving to all parties the right of appeal from the single or several decisions rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXV. Once a hearing notice has been issued commencing an adjudicatory proceeding, no party shall communicate with the presiding officer or the secretary of state concerning the merits of the case except upon notice to all parties nor shall any party cause another person to make such communications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXVI. Within 30 days after a final decision, any party may file a motion for reconsideration which shall serve as a petition for rehearing under RSA 541.  No distinctions shall be made between the terms "reconsideration'' and "rehearing.''  A motion for reconsideration shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Identify each error of law, error of reasoning, or erroneous conclusion contained in the final order which the moving party wishes the secretary of state to reconsider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Concisely state the correct factual finding, correct reasoning, and correct conclusion being advocated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Include any memorandum of law the petitioner wishes to submit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXVII. Within 30 days after a final decision, the presiding officer may reconsider, revise or reverse any final action on the presiding officer's own motion.  If reconsideration is based upon the existing record, prior notice shall not be given to the parties.  If the presiding officer believes further information or argument should be considered, the parties shall be provided with an appropriate notice and opportunity to be heard before any revision is made in the previous action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXVIII. The filing of a motion for reconsideration shall not operate as a stay of any order or decision, but a motion for stay may be combined with a motion for reconsideration.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The Internet communication contains a legend in which it is clearly stated that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, or investment adviser representative in question may only transact business in this state if first licensed, excluded, or exempted from state broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, or investment adviser representative licensing requirements, as may be.
<br>

(ii) Follow-up, individualized responses to persons in this state by such broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, or investment adviser representative that involve either the effecting of or attempting to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, as may be, will not be made absent compliance with state broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, or investment adviser representative licensing requirements, or an applicable exemption or exclusion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The Internet communication contains a mechanism, including and without limitation, technical "firewalls'' or other implemented policies and procedures, designed reasonably to ensure that prior to any subsequent, direct communication with prospective customers or clients in this state, said broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, or investment adviser representative is first licensed in this state or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from such requirement.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve a state licensed broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, or investment adviser representative from any applicable securities registration requirement in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The Internet communication does not involve either effecting or attempting to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, as may be, in this state over the Internet, but is limited to the dissemination of general information on products and services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) The broker-dealer or investment adviser with whom the broker-dealer agent or investment adviser representative is associated first authorizes the distribution of information on the particular products and services through the Internet communication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) In disseminating information through the Internet communication, the broker-dealer agent or investment adviser representative acts within the scope of the authority granted by the broker-dealer or investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Subparagraph (a) of this paragraph extends to state broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, and investment adviser representative registration requirements only, and does not excuse compliance with applicable securities registration, antifraud, or related provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect the activities of any broker-dealer, investment adviser, broker-dealer agent, and investment adviser representative engaged in business in this state that is not subject to the jurisdiction of the secretary of state as a result of the National Securities Markets Improvements Act of 1996, as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) (1) An offer of securities by means of the Internet is not subject to the registration and exemption requirements of RSA 421-B:11 where the following conditions apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The Internet offer indicates, directly or indirectly, that the securities are not being offered to the residents of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) An offer is not otherwise specifically directed to any person in this state by, or on behalf of, the issuer of securities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Sales of securities that are the subject of an Internet offer are allowed in this state where the following conditions apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) No sales of the securities shall be made in any state until the offering has been registered and declared effective and the final prospectus or Form U-7 has been delivered to the investor prior to such sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The sales are exempt from registration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. RSA 421-B:3, RSA 421-B:4, and RSA 421-B:5, so far as any person is concerned, and RSA 421-B:6, so far as investment advisors are concerned, apply when any act instrumental in effecting prohibited conduct is done in this state, whether or not either party is then present in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Every applicant for licensing under this chapter and every issuer who proposes to offer a security in this state through any person acting on an agency basis in the common-law sense shall file with the secretary of state, in such form as the secretary of state prescribes by rule, irrevocable consent appointing the secretary of state to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action, or proceeding against the applicant or the applicant's successor, executor, or administrator which arises under this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent.  A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous registration or notice filing need not file another.  In instances where an offering is firmly underwritten, the issuer shall not be required to file a consent.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the secretary of state along with $5, but it is not effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The plaintiff, who may be the attorney general in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at his last address on file with the attorney general, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this paragraph is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. When any person, including any nonresident of this state engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, and he has not filed a consent to service of process under paragraph VII and personal jurisdiction over him cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to his appointment of the secretary of state to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action, or proceeding against him or his successor, executor, or administrator which grows out of that conduct and which is brought under this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, with the same force and validity as if served on him personally.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process along with $5 in the office of the secretary of state, and it is not effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The plaintiff who may be the attorney general in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him, immediately sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at his last known address or takes other steps which are reasonably calculated to give actual notice, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this paragraph is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. When process is served under this chapter, the court, or the secretary of state in a proceeding before him, shall order such continuance as may be necessary to afford the defendant or respondent reasonable opportunity to defend.
