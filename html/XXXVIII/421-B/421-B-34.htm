I. Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before January 1, 1982, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within 3 years after January 1, 1982.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All effective licenses and qualifications under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this chapter had not been passed.  They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this chapter, but are governed by prior law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Prior law applies in respect of any offer or sale made within one year after January 1, 1982, pursuant to an offering begun in good faith before that date on the basis of an exemption available under prior law.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by January 1, 1982, are governed by this chapter, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after January 1, 1982.
