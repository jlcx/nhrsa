&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:13 Registration by Coordination. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any security for which a registration statement has been filed under the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with the same offering may be registered by coordination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A registration statement under this section shall contain the following information and be accompanied by the following documents in addition to the information specified in RSA 421-B:15 and the consent to service of process required by RSA 421-B:30, VII:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Two copies of the latest form of prospectus filed under the Securities Act of 1933;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the secretary of state by rule or otherwise requires, a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or their substantial equivalents) currently in effect, a copy of any agreements with or among underwriters, a copy of any indenture or other instrument governing the issuance of the security to be registered, and a specimen or copy of the security;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the secretary of state requests, any other information or copies of any other documents, filed under the Securities Act of 1933;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An undertaking to forward all future amendments to the federal prospectus, other than an amendment which merely delays the effective date of the registration statement, promptly and in any event not later than the first business day after the day they are forwarded to or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or such longer period as the secretary of state permits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A registration statement under this section automatically becomes effective at the moment the federal registration statement becomes effective if all the following conditions are satisfied:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No stop order is in effect and no proceeding is pending under RSA 421-B:16;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The registration statement has been on file with the secretary of state for at least 20 days;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A statement of the maximum and minimum proposed offering prices and the maximum underwriting discounts and commissions has been on file for 2 full business days or such shorter period as the secretary of state permits by rule or otherwise and the offering is made within those limitations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The secretary of state may by rule or otherwise waive either or both of the conditions specified in subparagraphs III(b) and (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The registrant shall promptly notify the secretary of state by telephone, telegram, or similar means of communication of the date and time when the federal registration statement became effective and the content of the price amendment, if any, and shall promptly file a post-effective amendment containing the information and documents in the price amendment.  "Price amendment'' means the final federal amendment which includes a statement of the offering price, underwriting and selling discounts or commissions, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices, and other matters dependent upon the offering price.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon failure to receive the required notification and post-effective amendment with respect to the price amendment, the secretary of state may enter a stop order, without notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until there is compliance with this section, if he promptly notifies the registrant by telephone, telegram, or similar means of communication, and promptly confirms by letter or telegram when he notifies by telephone of the issuance of the order.  If the registrant proves compliance with the requirements of this section as to notice and post-effective amendment the stop order is void as of the time of its entry.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the federal registration statement becomes effective before all the conditions in this section are satisfied and they are not waived, the registration statement automatically becomes effective as soon as all of the conditions are satisfied.  If the registrant advises the secretary of state of the date when the federal registration statement is expected to become effective, the secretary of state shall promptly advise the registrant by telephone, telegram, or similar means of communication, at the registrant's expense, whether all the conditions are satisfied and whether he then contemplates the institution of a proceeding under RSA 421-B:16;  but this advice by the secretary of state does not preclude the institution of such a proceeding at any time.
