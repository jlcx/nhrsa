&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:6 Licensing Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is unlawful for any person to transact business in this state as a broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, investment adviser, or agent unless such person is licensed under this chapter.  Except with respect to advisers whose only clients are those described in RSA 421-B:2, IX(f), it is unlawful for any federal covered adviser to conduct advisory business in this state unless such person complies with the provisions of RSA 421-B:7, I-b.  An investment adviser representative is required to be licensed as an agent under this section, in addition to any agent license held as a representative of any broker-dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. In connection with an offering of securities made pursuant to section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act of 1933 that requires only a notice filing in this state pursuant to RSA 421-B:11, I-a(e), a completed application for licensure as an issuer-dealer, an agent of an issuer-dealer and for an agent of the issuer, or authorization without licensure for an officer or director described in RSA 421-B:2, II(e), shall be filed with the secretary of state no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in or from this state, and the license or authorization will become effective without further action or review by the secretary of state.  Provided that the application is complete and accompanied by the appropriate fees, the effective date of the license or authorization shall for all purposes be the date of first sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. The issuer-dealer applications referred to in paragraph I-a shall set forth and be limited to the name of the issuer, the state of the issuer's formation, a description of the securities sold, the date of first sale of such securities in or from this state, the name or names of the representative or representatives of the issuer who are engaged in the sale of the securities, and confirmation that no agent has been convicted of a felony.  The applications need only be signed by that person or those persons who are authorized to do so by the issuer's board of directors or other governing body.  At the same time, the issuer shall submit a consent to service of process pursuant to RSA 421-B:30, VII, and shall pay the fees required by RSA 421-B:31.  Each application shall be on a form prescribed by the secretary of state, consistent with the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is unlawful for any broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, and investment adviser to employ an agent unless the agent is licensed, or for a federal covered adviser to employ, supervise, or associate with an investment adviser representative having a place of business located in this state, unless such investment adviser representative is licensed as an agent under this chapter, or is exempt from the licensing requirements.  Under this chapter, an agent's license is only in effect when such agent is associated with a particular broker-dealer, investment adviser, federal covered adviser, issuer-dealer, or a particular issuer.  No agent shall at any time represent more than one broker-dealer or issuer-dealer, except that where broker-dealers or issuer-dealers affiliated by direct common control are licensed under this chapter, an agent may represent any such broker-dealer or issuer-dealer.  When an agent begins or terminates those activities that make the person an agent, the broker-dealer, issuer-dealer, federal covered adviser, and investment adviser shall promptly notify the secretary of state.  When an investment adviser representative begins or terminates employment with a federal covered adviser, the investment adviser representative shall promptly notify the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. No person shall be issued an issuer-dealer license unless at least one person engaged in offering securities for sale on behalf of the issuer-dealer is licensed as an issuer-dealer agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All licenses for agents, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and issuer-dealers or notice filings for federal covered advisers shall expire every year on December 31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. A federal covered adviser who has paid a notice filing fee in this state for a particular calendar year and subsequently during that year becomes a state regulated investment adviser licensed in this state, shall not be assessed an additional fee (initial license fee) as it makes the transition to a licensed investment adviser in that year.  A state regulated investment adviser who has paid a license fee in this state for a particular calendar year and subsequently during that year becomes a federal covered adviser, shall not be assessed an additional fee (notice filing fee) for the transition to a federal covered adviser in that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. All licensed agents, broker-dealers, investment advisers, federal covered advisers, and issuer-dealers and any persons applying for such licenses shall be liable for the fees established pursuant to RSA 421-B:31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Prior to opening or closing a branch office in this state, a broker-dealer or investment adviser shall send written notification directly to the secretary of state of the location of the branch office, telephone number, name of the individual supervising the office, the date of the opening or closing, and any other pertinent information required by the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(2) If more than one business enterprise is conducted from a branch office location, disclosures shall clearly set forth the name of each business enterprise, what business activity is conducted by each organization, and each licensed agent's relationship to each organization;  provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to television, radio, or billboard advertising that pertains exclusively to a non-securities product.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c)(1) Each broker-dealer branch office within this state shall be supervised by a manager who is a licensed agent in New Hampshire and who shall have qualified as a principal by passing a National Association of Securities Dealers principal's examination applicable to the licensee's business conducted at that location.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Each broker-dealer and investment adviser shall establish and maintain supervisory procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with all applicable securities laws and statutes.  The responsibility for such supervisory procedure shall be determined by various factors, including but not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(G) The disciplinary history of its agents and investment adviser representatives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Sales of securities made pursuant to qualified pension plans, qualified profit-sharing plans, and dividend reinvestment plans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Sales or distributions of securities to majority owned subsidiaries.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(1) RSA 421-B:17;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) RSA 421-B:6;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That granting the exemption will be consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII-b. (a) The use of a senior-specific certification or designation by any person in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of securities, or the provision of advice as to the value of, or the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, either directly or indirectly or through publications or writings, or by issuing or promulgating analyses or reports relating to securities, that indicates or implies that the user has special certification or training in advising or servicing senior citizens or retirees, in such a way as to mislead any person shall be a dishonest and unethical practice in the securities business within the meaning of RSA 421-B:10, I(b)(7).  The prohibited use of such certifications or professional designation includes, but is not limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Use of a certification or professional designation that indicates or implies a level of occupational qualifications obtained through education, training, or experience that the person using the certification or professional designation does not have;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Does not have reasonable standards or procedures for monitoring and disciplining its designees or certificants for improper or unethical conduct;  or
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In determining whether a combination of words or an acronym standing for a combination of words constitutes a certification or professional designation indicating or implying that a person has special certification or training in advising or servicing senior citizens or retirees, factors to be considered shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Use of one or more words such as "senior,'' "retirement,'' "elder,'' or like words, combined with one or more words such as "certified,'' "registered,'' "chartered,'' "adviser,'' "specialist,'' "consultant,'' "planner,'' or like words, in the name of the certification or professional designation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The manner in which those words are combined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For purposes of this subparagraph;  "financial services regulatory agency'' includes, but is not limited to, an agency that regulates broker-dealers, investment advisers, or investment companies as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Specifies an individual's area of specialization within the organization.
<br>
