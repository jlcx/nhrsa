<center><h3>Section 421-B:5-502-A</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 421-B:5-502-A Custody of Client Funds or Securities by Investment Advisers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Safekeeping required.  It is unlawful and deemed to be a fraudulent or deceitful act, practice, or course of business for an investment adviser, registered or required to be registered, to have custody of client funds or securities unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Notice to secretary of state.  The investment adviser notifies the secretary of state promptly in writing that the investment adviser has or may have custody.  Such notification is required to be given on Form ADV;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Qualified custodian.  A qualified custodian maintains those funds and securities:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) in a separate account for each client under that client's name;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in accounts that contain only the investment adviser's clients' funds and securities, under the investment adviser's name as agent or trustee for the clients, or, in the case of a pooled investment vehicle that the investment adviser manages, in the name of the pooled investment vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Notice to clients.  If an investment adviser opens an account with a qualified custodian on its client's behalf, under the client's name, under the name of the investment adviser as agent, or under the name of a pooled investment vehicle, the investment adviser must notify the client in writing of the qualified custodian's name, address, and the manner in which the funds or securities are maintained, promptly when the account is opened and following any changes to this information.  If the investment adviser sends account statements to a client to which the investment adviser is required to provide this notice, the investment adviser must include in the notification provided to that client and in any subsequent account statement the investment adviser sends that client a statement urging the client to compare the account statements from the custodian with those from the investment adviser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Account statements.  The investment adviser has a reasonable basis, after due inquiry, for believing that the qualified custodian sends an account statement, at least quarterly, to each client for which it maintains funds or securities, identifying the amount of funds and the amount of each security in the account at the end of the period and setting forth all transactions in the account during that period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Special rule for limited partnerships and limited liability companies.  If the investment adviser or a related person is a general partner of a limited partnership (or managing member of a limited liability company, or holds a comparable position for another type of pooled investment vehicle), the account statements required under subsection (a)(4) must be sent to each limited partner (or member or other beneficial owner).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Independent verification.  The client funds and securities of which the investment adviser has custody are verified by actual examination at least once during each calendar year, by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to a written agreement between the investment adviser and the independent certified public accountant, at a time that is chosen by the independent certified public accountant without prior notice or announcement to the investment adviser and that is irregular from year to year.  The written agreement must provide for the first examination to occur within 6 months of becoming subject to subsection (a)(6), except that, if the investment adviser maintains client funds or securities pursuant to this section as a qualified custodian, the agreement must provide for the first examination to occur no later than 6 months after obtaining the internal control report.  The written agreement must require the independent certified public accountant to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) file a certificate on Form ADV-E with the secretary of state within 120 days of the time chosen by the independent certified public accountant in subsection (a)(6), stating that it has examined the funds and securities and describing the nature and extent of the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) notify the secretary of state within one business day of the finding of any material discrepancies during the course of the examination, by means of a facsimile transmission or electronic mail, followed by first class mail, directed to the attention of the secretary of state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) file within 4 business days of the resignation or dismissal from, or other termination of, the engagement, or removing itself or being removed from consideration for being reappointed, Form ADV-E accompanied by a statement that includes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The date of such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other termination, and the name, address, and contact information of the independent certified public accountant;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) An explanation of any problems relating to examination scope or procedure that contributed to such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) Investment advisers acting as qualified custodians.  If the investment adviser maintains, or if the investment adviser has custody because a related person maintains, client funds or securities pursuant to this section as a qualified custodian in connection with advisory services the investment adviser provides to clients, the following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The investment adviser must obtain, or receive from its related person, within 6 months of becoming subject to subsection (a)(7) and thereafter no less frequently than once each calendar year a written internal control report prepared by an independent certified public accountant:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The internal control report must include an opinion of an independent certified public accountant as to whether controls have been placed in operation as of a specific date, and are suitably designed and are operating effectively to meet control objectives relating to custodial services, including the safeguarding of funds and securities held by either the investment adviser or a related person on behalf of the investment adviser's clients, during the year;
