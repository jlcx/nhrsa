<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) a Form U-4 for each agent of the issuer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) copies of disclosures, which shall be included in the offering documents, consistent with policies, guidelines, and standards, including suitability standards, promulgated by the North American Securities Administrators Association, in order to provide full and fair disclosure for the benefit of investors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Conditions for effectiveness of registration statement.  A registration statement under this section becomes effective simultaneously with or subsequent to the federal registration statement when all the following conditions are satisfied:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) a stop order under subsection (d) or RSA 421-B:3-306 or issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission is not in effect and a proceeding is not pending against the issuer under RSA 421-B:4-412;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the registration statement has been on file for at least 20 days or a shorter period provided by order issued under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Notice of federal registration statement effectiveness.  The registrant shall promptly notify the secretary of state in a record of the date when the federal registration statement becomes effective and the content of any price amendment and shall promptly file a record containing the price amendment.  If the notice is not timely received, the secretary of state may issue a stop order, without prior notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until compliance with this section.  The secretary of state shall promptly notify the registrant of an order by telegram, telephone, or electronic means and promptly confirm this notice by a record.  If the registrant subsequently complies with the notice requirements of this section, the stop order is void as of the date of its issuance.

(e) Effectiveness of registration statement.  If the federal registration statement becomes effective before each of the conditions in this section is satisfied or is waived by the secretary of state, the registration statement is automatically effective under this chapter when all the conditions are satisfied or waived.  If the registrant notifies the secretary of state of the date when the federal registration statement is expected to become effective, the secretary of state shall promptly notify the registrant by telegram, telephone, or electronic means and promptly confirm this notice by a record, indicating whether all the conditions are satisfied or waived and whether the secretary of state intends the institution of a proceeding under RSA 421-B:3-306.  The notice by the secretary of state does not preclude the institution of such a proceeding.
