(a) Upon completion of an examination, the examiner in charge shall make a true report thereof which shall comprise only facts appearing upon the books, records or other documents of the person examined, or as ascertained from the sworn testimony of its officers or agents or other individuals examined concerning its affairs, and such conclusions and recommendations as may reasonably be warranted from such facts.

In any such action or proceeding, the secretary of state or his examiners may, however, at any time testify and offer proper evidence as to information secured or matters discovered during the course of an examination, whether or not a written report of the examination has been either made, furnished, or filed in the department.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. All reports pursuant to this section shall be absolutely privileged and although filed in the department as provided in paragraph V shall nevertheless not be for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be deemed confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection, except as the secretary of state in his or her discretion may deem advisable.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI-a. The broker-dealer or other person examined pursuant to this section shall bear the expense of the examination.  Such expenses shall be limited to a reasonable per diem allowance for compensation and expenses as determined by the secretary of state.  The per diem allowance shall not exceed $100.
