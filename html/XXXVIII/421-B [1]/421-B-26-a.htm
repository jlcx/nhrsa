The presiding officer shall cause the administrative hearing to be electronically recorded.  Such recording shall be made available, upon written request by a party and upon a fee sufficient to reimburse the full cost of providing the tape, or a true and accurate copy of such tape or tapes.  A party may request, in writing, a transcript of the hearing but shall first pay the full costs for such transcription as determined by the secretary of state.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXVII. In the event there is a clear dispute of facts between the parties in which credibility of testimony will determine the outcome of the hearing, the presiding officer on his own motion or that of a party, may sequester witnesses until they are called to testify.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXVIII. In any administrative hearing in which administrative action affecting the rights or privileges of any party may be taken, an oath or affirmation shall be administered by the presiding officer to each witness prior to receiving testimony, provided, however, that if a witness asserts an objection to the taking of an oath for religious or other related reasons, an affirmation shall be administered.  Once a witness has been sworn at any hearing, it shall not be necessary to swear the witness again for subsequent testimony on the same day and in the same case.  The record of the proceeding shall indicate that a person was recalled to testify and reminded that such person was still under oath or affirmation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIX. Motions shall be in written form unless presented at the hearing.  Written motions shall be included in the record of the proceeding and filed together with the case file.  Oral motions shall be recorded in full in any transcript of the proceeding or, at the discretion of the presiding officer, noted in the minutes of the proceeding and submitted in written form within a reasonable time.  A presiding officer may rule upon a motion when made or may defer decision until a later time in the hearing, or until after the conclusion of the hearing.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXX. Administrative hearings shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, nor by technical or formal rules of procedure.  All relevant, material, and reliable evidence shall be admissible.  Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to, depositions, affidavits, official documents, and testimony of witnesses.  Provided, however, the presiding officer may, in the presiding officer's discretion, exclude any irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or unduly cumulative or repetitious evidence.  Applicable statutory and constitutional provisions and immunities requiring exclusion of evidence in civil proceedings shall be recognized, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit a party from waiving such party's privilege or immunity.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXI. Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a written decision stating the action to be taken by the department and may set forth findings of fact, conclusions of law, and disposition.  All decisions shall be reached upon the basis of a preponderance of the evidence.  The decision of the presiding officer shall be construed as the decision of the secretary of state.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXII. Any party to whom notice has been forwarded pursuant to and in accordance with these rules who fails to appear shall have a default judgment rendered against him.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXIII. The presiding officer may take judicial notice.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXIV. Where the interests of justice will be better served without prejudice to the substantial rights of any party, a presiding officer may sever one case from another or may consolidate 2 or more cases, preserving to all parties the right of appeal from the single or several decisions rendered.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXV. Once a hearing notice has been issued commencing an adjudicatory proceeding, no party shall communicate with the presiding officer or the secretary of state concerning the merits of the case except upon notice to all parties nor shall any party cause another person to make such communications.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXVI. Within 30 days after a final decision, any party may file a motion for reconsideration which shall serve as a petition for rehearing under RSA 541.  No distinctions shall be made between the terms reconsideration'' and rehearing.''  A motion for reconsideration shall:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) Identify each error of law, error of reasoning, or erroneous conclusion contained in the final order which the moving party wishes the secretary of state to reconsider.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) Concisely state the correct factual finding, correct reasoning, and correct conclusion being advocated.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3) Include any memorandum of law the petitioner wishes to submit.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXVII. Within 30 days after a final decision, the presiding officer may reconsider, revise or reverse any final action on the presiding officer's own motion.  If reconsideration is based upon the existing record, prior notice shall not be given to the parties.  If the presiding officer believes further information or argument should be considered, the parties shall be provided with an appropriate notice and opportunity to be heard before any revision is made in the previous action.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXXVIII. The filing of a motion for reconsideration shall not operate as a stay of any order or decision, but a motion for stay may be combined with a motion for reconsideration.">

Oral motions shall be recorded in full in any transcript of the proceeding or, at the discretion of the presiding officer, noted in the minutes of the proceeding and submitted in written form within a reasonable time.  A presiding officer may rule upon a motion when made or may defer decision until a later time in the hearing, or until after the conclusion of the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XX. Administrative hearings shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, nor by technical or formal rules of procedure.  All relevant, material, and reliable evidence shall be admissible.  Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to, depositions, affidavits, official documents, and testimony of witnesses.  Provided, however, the presiding officer may, in the presiding officer's discretion, exclude any irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or unduly cumulative or repetitious evidence.  Applicable statutory and constitutional provisions and immunities requiring exclusion of evidence in civil proceedings shall be recognized, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit a party from waiving such party's privilege or immunity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXI. Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a written decision stating the action to be taken by the department and may set forth findings of fact, conclusions of law, and disposition.  All decisions shall be reached upon the basis of a preponderance of the evidence.  The decision of the presiding officer shall be construed as the decision of the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXII. Any party to whom notice has been forwarded pursuant to and in accordance with these rules who fails to appear shall have a default judgment rendered against him.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXIII. The presiding officer may take judicial notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXIV. Where the interests of justice will be better served without prejudice to the substantial rights of any party, a presiding officer may sever one case from another or may consolidate 2 or more cases, preserving to all parties the right of appeal from the single or several decisions rendered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXV. Once a hearing notice has been issued commencing an adjudicatory proceeding, no party shall communicate with the presiding officer or the secretary of state concerning the merits of the case except upon notice to all parties nor shall any party cause another person to make such communications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXVI. Within 30 days after a final decision, any party may file a motion for reconsideration which shall serve as a petition for rehearing under RSA 541.  No distinctions shall be made between the terms "reconsideration'' and "rehearing.''  A motion for reconsideration shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Identify each error of law, error of reasoning, or erroneous conclusion contained in the final order which the moving party wishes the secretary of state to reconsider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Concisely state the correct factual finding, correct reasoning, and correct conclusion being advocated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Include any memorandum of law the petitioner wishes to submit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXVII. Within 30 days after a final decision, the presiding officer may reconsider, revise or reverse any final action on the presiding officer's own motion.  If reconsideration is based upon the existing record, prior notice shall not be given to the parties.  If the presiding officer believes further information or argument should be considered, the parties shall be provided with an appropriate notice and opportunity to be heard before any revision is made in the previous action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXVIII. The filing of a motion for reconsideration shall not operate as a stay of any order or decision, but a motion for stay may be combined with a motion for reconsideration.
