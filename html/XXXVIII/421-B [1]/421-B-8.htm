When the sixtieth day falls on a weekend, or on a New Hampshire state or federal legal holiday, the due date shall be automatically extended to the next business day following such weekend or holiday.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. In addition to the above, the secretary of state may require at any reasonable time and in any reasonable manner from any person or company subject to this chapter:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Statements, reports, including reports audited by independent public accountants, answers to questionnaires and other information, and evidence thereof, in whatever reasonable form he designates, and at such reasonable intervals as he may choose, or from time to time;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) A full explanation of the programming of any data storage or communications systems in use;  and<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Information from any books, records, electronic data processing systems, computers or any other information storage system.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV.
