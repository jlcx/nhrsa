The director may establish equipment standards by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 260:5, for the manufacture of special motor vehicles, or for the assembly and construction of vehicles from new or used parts or kits, or for the alteration or reconstruction of a motor vehicle which places it in the category of a special motor vehicle.  Such standards shall be established for the purpose of reducing the danger of death and injury to the drivers and passengers of such vehicles and to other users of the public highways.  The director may establish minimum construction and performance requirements that are technically feasible and based on sound engineering to achieve operational safety and to furnish a guide for registration eligibility and in-use conformity for vehicles in this category.
