&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No motor truck, trailer or semi-trailer while being used to transport baled hay shall be operated on the highways of this state unless the loads of baled hay, baled straw, or other baled products shall be solidly packed while in transit.  Loading methods shall result in completely tying the load together by alternating bale lengths and interlocking tiers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such loads shall be fastened securely to the vehicle by not less than 2 longitudinal rope binders from front to the back of vehicles, and by not less than 4 cross binders in addition to the longitudinal binders, binders to be of at least  3/4 inch diameter knot and rot-free manila rope.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of paragraphs I and II shall not apply to a local farmer transporting his own baled products incidental to his farming operations where such transportation requires the use of the highways;  provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve such farmer from loading and securing such bales in a safe manner.
