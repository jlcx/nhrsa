&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, trailers of 10,000 pounds or less gross vehicle weight rating not used in interstate commerce shall be exempt from periodic vehicle inspection requirements, but shall be subject as other vehicles are to periodic roadside inspection by law enforcement officers to determine that they have the proper required and fully functional safety equipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The director may authorize properly qualified dealers holding utility dealer registrations to inspect trailers of more than 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, to determine whether they are fit to be driven, and to issue inspection stickers, under rules adopted for this purpose pursuant to RSA 541-A.  This section shall not apply to full trailers as defined in RSA 259:37-a or semi-trailers as defined in RSA 259:98, and shall not prohibit other official inspection stations from inspecting trailers.
