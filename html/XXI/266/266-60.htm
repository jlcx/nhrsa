&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:60 Standards for Odometers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No passenger motor vehicle designated as a 1972 or later model which is manufactured after January 1, 1972, shall be registered in this state unless it is equipped with a tamper-resistant odometer designed with the intent to reduce the likelihood of unlawful tampering with the mileage reading thereon.  The director may adopt rules pursuant to RSA 260:5 establishing standards for such devices, which standards shall be consistent with provisions of federal law, if any, relating thereto.  The director shall not require, as a condition precedent to the initial sale of a vehicle, the inspection, certification or other approval of such odometer if such device or equipment has been certified by the manufacturer as complying with federal or state law or rule.
