<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For single unit 4-axle vehicles, 60,000 pounds, or a gross weight not in excess of that produced by application of the weight formula as defined in subparagraph (g), whichever is the greater.  Such vehicles shall have drive on 2 rear axles, and the tridem may contain not more than one retractable axle and, if not factory installed and load equalizing, must provide a system of load equalization by hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical means, and be equipped with brakes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For a combination of truck-tractor and semi-trailer equipped with 3 axles, the gross weight shall not exceed that set forth in table I as follows:

<PRE>
 LN 
The formula W = 500 ----- + 12N + 36
