[Repealed.]<center><p>[Paragraph III effective until September 19, 2014;  see also paragraph III set out below.]</p></center><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The commissioner, after public hearing and consultation with the commissioner of the department of environmental services and the air pollution advisory committee, and notification of the house science, technology, and energy committee and the senate environment committee, and with the approval of the air pollution advisory committee, shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A, which require all model year 1996 and newer gasoline-powered and model year 1997 and newer diesel-powered motor vehicles equipped with on-board diagnostic systems meeting the federal EPA OBD II standards driven on the ways of this state which are subject to inspection under this chapter, after a date specified by the commissioner, to be tested for OBD II indications of failures as a component of the inspection.  To the extent allowed by EPA OBD II policy, OBD II data may be substituted for visual and functional tests required by paragraph I.<center><p>[Paragraph III effective September 19, 2014;  see also paragraph III set out above.]</p></center><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. The commissioner, after public hearing and consultation with the commissioner of the department of environmental services and the air pollution advisory committee, and notification of the house science, technology, and energy committee and the senate environment committee, and with the approval of the air pollution advisory committee, shall adopt rules under RSA 541-A, which require motor vehicles equipped with an on-board diagnostic system meeting federal EPA OBD II (On-Board Diagnostics) standards that are driven on the ways of this state and which are subject to inspection under this chapter, after a date specified by the commissioner, to be tested for OBD II indications of failures as a component of the inspection.  Vehicles subject to this requirement shall include model year 1997 and newer diesel-powered motor vehicles and model year 1996 and newer motor vehicles powered by any other fuel source.  To the extent allowed by EPA OBD II policy, OBD II data may be substituted for visual and functional tests required by paragraph I.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. This section shall not apply to vehicles 20 or more model years old which shall be determined by subtracting the model year of the vehicle from the calendar year in which the inspection occurs.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. If a vehicle fails the EPA OBD II test and it passes all other inspection requirements under this chapter, then it shall be issued a temporary waiver that permits its operation for 60 days from the date of issuance, in order to make required repairs.  A vehicle shall be eligible for only one such waiver during its inspection cycle.  The department shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, that have the effect of establishing the broadest possible waivers for consumers consistent with 40 C.F.R. sections 51.350 through 51.373.  It is the intent of the legislature to provide appropriate waivers to persons for whom the making of OBD II repairs would constitute economic hardship.  The committee established in paragraph VII shall make recommendations for such waivers and the department shall consider such recommendations during the rulemaking process required by this paragraph.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. If a vehicle fails the EPA OBD II test and the owner fails to make the required repairs, the owner may not sell the vehicle without informing the purchaser of the OBD II failure.  If the owner fails to inform the purchaser of the OBD II failure, the purchaser shall be entitled to a refund of the purchase price and reasonable attorney's fees.<center><p>[Paragraph VII effective until September 19, 2014;  see also paragraph VII set out below.]</p></center><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII.
