&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:18 Weight on Interstate and Defense Highway System. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The driving on the interstate and defense highway system of this state of any vehicle or combination of vehicles exceeding the limitations of this section is hereby prohibited.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Maximum tire and axle gross weights allowable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(1) 20,000 pounds per axle on axles more than 8 feet apart;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) 17,000 pounds per axle on axles not more than 8 feet apart;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When being driven with a gross weight not in excess of 73,280 pounds:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) 22,400 pounds per axle on 3-axle single unit vehicles and on all other vehicles with axles 10 feet or more apart, including combination vehicles;

<PRE>
 LN 
 W = 500 ----- + 12N + 36
 N-1 
</PRE>
<br>
(In which W equals overall gross weight on any group of 2 or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds;  L equals the distance measured to the nearest foot between the extreme of any group of 2 or more consecutive axles;  and N equals the number of axles in the group under consideration.)  Except that 2 consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more and provided that such gross weight shall not exceed 80,000 pounds, including all law enforcement tolerances.
<PRE>
 LN 
The formula W = 500 ----- + 12N + 36
 N-1

(h) The following loaded vehicles shall not be driven over H15-44 bridges:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A combination vehicle equipped with 5 axles in the configuration of 3-axle truck-tractor and 2-axle semi-trailer with wheel base less than 38 feet or 2-axle truck-tractor with 1-axle semi-trailer and 2-axle full trailer with wheel base less than 45 feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A loaded single unit vehicle with full trailer equipped with axles with wheel base less than 45 feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Vehicles with 7, 8, or 9 axles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Coupled vehicles consisting of a truck together with a trailer attached to the truck by a pintle hook or similar coupling device with adequate breakaway protection as provided in RSA 266:63 may be driven, provided the total combined gross weight of the vehicles does not exceed 80,000 pounds and provided that each unit of the coupled vehicles shall be limited to the maximum permissible axle weights and gross weights of the individual units, and further provided that the weight of 2 or more consecutive axles of the coupled vehicle shall not be in excess of that produced by application of the weight formula as defined in subparagraph (g) and shall be limited to a total combined gross weight not in excess of 80,000 pounds, a single axle limit of 20,000 pounds and a tandem axle limit of 34,000 pounds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding paragraphs I and II, for as long as exemptions exist in 23 U.S.C. section 127 that allow maximum gross weights of up to 99,000 pounds on interstate routes 89, 93, and 95 of the interstate and defense highway system, the provisions of RSA 266:18-a regarding weight on the non-interstate and general highway system shall also apply to vehicles or combination vehicles while being operated on any sections of interstate routes 89, 93, or 95 not posted by the commissioner of transportation for lower weights.  Such vehicles shall not exceed the weight limits in paragraphs I and II unless they have been certified pursuant to RSA 266:18-d for the higher weights and paid the required fee the same as vehicles operating on the non-interstate highways as provided in RSA 266:18-d.
