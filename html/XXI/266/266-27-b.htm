&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:27-b Notification of Brake Shift Interlock and Key Position by Automobile Dealers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All motor vehicle dealers shall post the following notice in a prominent location at their place of business:
<center>
<p>
Important Safety Factors Regarding Automatic Transmissions and Key Positions
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. Most newer model motor vehicles with automatic transmissions are engineered with a "brake shift interlock'' system as a safety mechanism, which prevents movement from the "park'' position unless the service brake is applied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Some vehicles are engineered whereby the vehicle may be shifted from "park'' to "neutral'' in a "key'' position before the engine has been started without applying the service brake, which may cause the vehicle to roll.  Your vehicle may not contain roll prevention safety in all key positions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
3. Consumers should become familiar with the specific characteristics of their vehicles in all "key'' positions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
4. It is strongly recommended that the "parking'' brake be engaged when the vehicle is parked on a grade.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section imposes any liability on a motor vehicle dealer or creates a cause of action by a consumer against a dealer.
