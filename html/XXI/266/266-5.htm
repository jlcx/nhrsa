&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:5 Penalty for Failing to Obey Inspection Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The driver or owner of any motor vehicle failing to comply with the requirements of the director relative to inspection shall be guilty of a violation, and the director may refuse to register, or may suspend or revoke the registration of, any motor vehicle, trailer, or semi-trailer which has not been inspected as required or which is unsafe or unfit to be driven;  provided, however, no person shall be charged with a violation of this section until a period of 10 days has elapsed from the date the inspection was due.  It shall be a rebuttable presumption that a vehicle that is required to be inspected is in violation of this section if the vehicle fails to display a valid inspection sticker.  This section shall not apply to those vehicles required to be inspected under the provisions of RSA 266:1, IV.  The fine for a violation of this section shall be $60.
