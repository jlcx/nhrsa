&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:13-b Appurtenances on Motor Homes, Trailer Coaches, and Recreation Vehicles. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A motor home, trailer coach, or recreation vehicle may be driven on the ways of this state when the overall width is greater than 102 inches, provided the excess over 102 inches is solely due to a non-load-carrying appurtenance that extends no more than 6 inches beyond the body of the vehicle.  The term "appurtenance'' does not include any item that is temporarily affixed to the exterior of the vehicle by the vehicle's owner for the purpose of transporting the item from one location to another, but does include an awning and its support hardware and other items that are intended to be an integral part of the vehicle and were installed by the motor vehicle manufacturer or dealer.
