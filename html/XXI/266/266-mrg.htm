An inspection sticker shall be valid for the same duration as the vehicle's registration, which shall not exceed 16 months.  If the month in which the anniversary of the owner's birth occurs will be one of the next 4 months, an inspection sticker may be issued, with an expiration date of the birth month in the following year, of the first person named on the title application.  Nothing in this paragraph shall require any person who has registered and had inspected a vehicle with temporary plates to have the vehicle reinspected upon receipt of permanent motor vehicle plates.  An inspection sticker shall not expire when a vehicle is transferred to a licensed dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Notwithstanding RSA 266:1, II, if the month in which the anniversary of the owner's birth occurs will be one of the next 4 months, and the vehicle owner provides written verification of absence from New Hampshire during the entire anniversary month, an inspection sticker may be issued, with an expiration date of the birth month in the following year, of the first person named on the title application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the owner of the vehicle is a company or corporation or other than a natural person, the annual inspection shall be made during the month designated by the director as the registration month for such legal entity.  Vehicles registered as antique motor vehicles and antique motorcycles and which are 40 years old and over shall be inspected biennially.  Antique motor vehicles and custom vehicles shall be inspected in the month of April.  Without regard to the owner's birth date or registration month, motorcycles and recreational vehicles shall be inspected annually by July 1.

<center><h3>Section 266:18-c</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:18-c General Weight Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following provisions shall apply to any vehicle covered by RSA 266:18, 18-a, or 18-b, regardless of the type of way or highway on which it is driven, except as otherwise specified:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with any solid rubber tires shall not have weights more than 80 percent of those permitted;  provided that no vehicle equipped with solid rubber tires which has at any point less than one inch of rubber above the top or beyond the flange or rim shall be driven upon any way.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Motor vehicles or vehicles drawn by motor vehicles when equipped with metal or other hard tires shall not have weights more than 40 percent of those permitted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of RSA 266:18, 18-a, and 18-b shall not apply to vehicles used exclusively in the surfacing of ways of the state of New Hampshire, or subdivisions thereof;  provided that the commodities of tar, asphalt, or the combination thereof shall not exceed 2,000 gallons on any 2-axle vehicle, or 4,000 gallons on any 3-axle vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not be driven or moved over any bridge or other structure on any way if the weight of such vehicle, or combination of vehicles and load, is greater than the capacity of the structure as shown by a sign on the right side of or overhead on the structure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of transportation to cause signs to be erected at both ends on the right side of or overhead on all bridges or other structures under his jurisdiction stating the capacity in tons of 2,000 pounds which the bridge or other structure will safely carry.  As an alternative to posting signs with stated weight limits, the commissioner of transportation may, at his discretion, post standardized warning signs designating certain restricted bridges as caution crossing bridges, or as excluded bridges, and publish a list which designates all such bridges so conditioned at least annually.  For all other bridges or other structures it shall be the duty of the authority having jurisdiction to place similar signs.  The signing message for posting of weight limits for bridges and structures shall read as follows:
<center>
<p>
WEIGHT<br>LIMIT<br>X<br>TONS<br>
</p>
</center>
<br>
If the authority determines that a bridge or other structure may safely carry loads greater than this limit by vehicles with 3 or more axles, the signs shall read as follows:
<center>
<p>
GROSS WEIGHT LIMIT<br>X TONS OR<br>Y% OF LEGAL LOADS<br>
</p>
</center>
<br>
"X'' is the numerical value that equals the posted maximum legal gross weight limit for a 2-axle vehicle.  "Y%'' is the numerical value expressed as a percentage of the maximum legal gross weight limit of any single axle or tandem axle, and the combined gross weight limit of any 3-axle truck or any combination as noted in this section.  Where no special permit loads are allowed, the signing message for posting shall read as follows:
<center>
<p>
NO PERMIT LOAD<br>LEGAL LOADS MAXIMUM<br>
</p>
</center>
<br>
Upon bridges or other structures of sufficient strength to carry safely the legal loads permissible by this section, no such signs shall be required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A determination of the gross weight of vehicles under the tables as set forth in RSA 266:18, 18-a, and 18-b shall, in cases in which the distance between extreme axles is not in exact number of feet, be governed by the following:  if the distance is 6 inches or less in excess of the number of feet stated in the table, the gross weight shall be based upon the number of feet stated in the table;  if the distance is more than 6 inches in excess of the number of feet in the table, the gross weight shall be based upon the next higher number of feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any vehicle subject to this subdivision that utilizes an auxiliary power or idle reduction technology unit in order to promote reduction of fuel use and emissions because of engine idling, may be allowed up to an additional 550 pounds in gross, axle, tandem, or bridge formula weight limits.  To be eligible for this exception the driver of the vehicle must be able to prove by written certification the weight of the auxiliary power unit and by demonstration or certification that the idle reduction technology is fully functional at all times.  Certification of the weight of the auxiliary power unit must be available to law enforcement officers if the vehicle is found in violation of applicable weight laws.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:18-d Additional Certification and Registration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No vehicle shall be driven on any way with a gross vehicle weight in excess of the weight limits specified in RSA 266:18-a without having obtained a certification therefor from the commissioner of the department of safety.  The certification shall be in addition to any other requirements provided by law.  Any vehicle so certified may be driven on any way other than the interstate or defense highway system in accordance with the limits established by RSA 266:18-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall issue said certificate upon receiving proper application.  The application shall be accompanied by an additional fee of $105 and the certification shall be in effect for a period of one year.  The certification shall expire upon the sale or transfer of the vehicle.  The certification shall cover a power unit and not more than one trailer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Vehicles so certified include the power unit and trailer.  The vehicle shall be certified upon submission to the department of documentation satisfactory to the department from the manufacturer attesting that the vehicle is capable of safely carrying the additional weight.  Such attestation shall be required upon the first application for certification and a new attestation shall be required at any time when the configuration of the vehicle relative to power unit, axles, springs, or other safety items that could affect the vehicle's ability to qualify for an excess weight certification is altered.  Such attestation shall designate the maximum safe gross weight for the vehicles as determined by the components and the summation of the manufacturer's axle design limits for each axle of the vehicle.  The power unit and trailer shall be required at all times to have a current inspection sticker or decal from an official inspection station.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A vehicle so certified shall be considered to have reciprocity with other states granting New Hampshire similar reciprocity for the full weight limit designated in RSA 266:18-b or the weight limit for which the vehicle is registered, whichever is less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Upon certification a vehicle shall be eligible for an additional registration authorizing the driving of the vehicle in accordance with the weight limits established in RSA 266:18-b.  The fee for such additional registration shall be determined in accordance with the vehicle registration fee provided by law and shall be in addition to the certification fee contained in paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. Out-of-state carriers operating under apportioned registration and requesting to carry additional weight shall comply with the requirements of this section and shall be registered for the additional weight they are certified to carry in order to be eligible for certification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-b. If a vehicle is declared out of service for a safety violation or is issued a citation for an axle distance violation, the certification shall be inoperative until the condition has been rectified.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner or his designee may revoke or suspend any additional registration granted pursuant to paragraph V of any vehicle or vehicles which are being driven in violation of the limits established by RSA 266:18-b or any other provision of law as evidenced by a record of such violations.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A pertaining to the procedures for such revocation or suspension and the application, certification, and inspection process for additional truck weights, as well as procedures to become certified as a vehicle inspector for additional weights.

</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. Most newer model motor vehicles with automatic transmissions are engineered with a "brake shift interlock'' system as a safety mechanism, which prevents movement from the "park'' position unless the service brake is applied.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Some vehicles are engineered whereby the vehicle may be shifted from "park'' to "neutral'' in a "key'' position before the engine has been started without applying the service brake, which may cause the vehicle to roll.  Your vehicle may not contain roll prevention safety in all key positions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
3. Consumers should become familiar with the specific characteristics of their vehicles in all "key'' positions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 266:72-a Motor Carriers;  Equipment;  Roadside Inspections. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may adopt as rules, under RSA 541-A, the current version of the federal motor carrier safety regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, contained in 49 C.F.R. parts 107, 382, and 385-397.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 541-A, any amendments or additions by the respective federal agencies or their successor agencies shall also amend or supplement the rules adopted by the commissioner of safety without further action on the part of the commissioner.  The commissioner shall be authorized to exempt vehicles and drivers operating exclusively in intrastate commerce from such rules which the commissioner determines impose an unnecessary regulatory burden without providing a corresponding safety benefit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the commissioner finds that a motor carrier safety regulation in 49 C.F.R. sections 390-397, provides an equal or greater degree of safety the commissioner may, pursuant to RSA 260:5, adopt the federal regulation as a rule, and the rule shall take precedence over the conflicting provisions of this title.  No person who is in compliance with the corresponding rule adopted by the commissioner shall be convicted of violating a conflicting provision of this title.  The commissioner shall request the introduction, at the next annual session of the legislature following adoption of such a rule, of legislation amending or repealing the conflicting provision of this title and, if the legislation is not enacted, any rule so adopted shall be automatically repealed 60 days after the last day of the legislative session.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The drivers of all vehicles subject to the motor carrier rules who operate exclusively in intrastate commerce shall be subject to the medical examination, written tests, and road tests required by 49 C.F.R. sections 391.31-391.49, as amended, provided, however, that the commissioner may waive specific requirements or standards of the medical examination for any such driver who has a valid commercial driver's license issued by this state on or after January 1, 1990, if it would not jeopardize public safety to grant such a waiver.  The commissioner may adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A relative to standards for the granting of such waivers.  The department shall make interested parties aware of the provisions of this paragraph.  Once a waiver is granted under this paragraph, the waiver shall be placed on the medical examination card required by federal regulation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. Paragraph III shall not apply to intrastate transportation performed by the state, or any political subdivision of the state.  However, nothing in this section shall prevent or inhibit any public employer from establishing internal policies making the motor carrier safety rules applicable to its vehicles and drivers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Utility service vehicle drivers providing intrastate service shall be exempt from the provisions of 49 C.F.R. 395 as adopted pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) A driver of a motor carrier shall stop the vehicle on the request of any enforcement officer of the department of safety or other law enforcement agent certified to conduct truck inspections or by command of roadside signs so that the officer may:

(2) Enter the cab or cargo area as necessary to determine that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The vehicle is in safe operating condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The cargo is properly secured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Every owner/operator of a motor carrier, or his or her authorized agent, shall submit accounts, books, records, memoranda, correspondence, and other documents for inspection, upon demand by any enforcement officer of the department of safety or other law enforcement agent certified to conduct truck inspections who in the course of enforcing the motor carrier rules is acting within the scope of his or her duties and authority, at the motor carrier's principal place of business during regular business hours.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any operator who fails to stop or allow inspection as described in subparagraph (a) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  A second violation of subparagraph (a) shall result in suspension of the person's license or privilege to drive in New Hampshire and notification of such suspension to national motor vehicle license databases.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The driver of any vehicle operating intrastate and registered with New Hampshire farm or agricultural plates and with a gross vehicle weight, gross vehicle weight rating, or gross combination weight rating of 26,000 pounds or less;  designed or used to transport fewer than 16 passengers, including the driver;  and which does not transport materials required to be placarded pursuant to 49 C.F.R. part 172, subpart F, shall be exempt from the provisions of 49 C.F.R. parts 391, 392, 393, 395, and 396, as adopted as rules pursuant to this section, except that such exemption shall not apply to the requirements of 49 C.F.R. section 392.3, operating while fatigued or ill, 49 C.F.R. section 392.4, use of illegal drugs or substances, 49 C.F.R. section 392.5, driver use of alcohol, 49 C.F.R. part 393, subpart C, brakes, and 49 C.F.R. section 396.7, unsafe operations forbidden.
