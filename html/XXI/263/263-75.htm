&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 263:75 Appeal;  Administrative License Suspension. &#150;</b>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the suspension is sustained after a hearing as provided in RSA 265:91-b, a person shall have the right to file a petition in the superior court in the county in which he was arrested to review the final order by the director or his authorized agent within 30 days of the date of the final order.  Jurisdiction to hear such appeals is vested in the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At the earliest practical time, the court shall review the record as developed before the director or authorized agent, together with any written legal argument presented to the court.  Based on that review, the court may affirm or reverse the decision of the director or agent or order that oral argument be held.  As justice may require, the court may remand the case to the director or authorized agent for further findings or rulings.  In no event shall the oral argument be held less than 14 days after notice has been provided to the director.  The petition for appeal shall set forth all the grounds upon which the final order is sought to be overturned.  Issues not raised by the appellant before the director or agent shall not be raised before the superior court.  The burden of proof shall be upon the appellant to show that the decision of the director or agent was clearly unreasonable or unlawful, and all findings of the director or agent upon all questions of fact properly before him shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable.  The order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law, unless the court is satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence before it, that the order is unjust or unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No new or additional evidence shall be introduced in the superior court, but the case shall be determined upon the record and evidence transferred, except that in any case, if it shall be necessary in order that no party shall be deprived of any constitutional right, or if the court shall be of the opinion that justice requires the reception of evidence of facts which have occurred since the hearing, or which by reason of accident, mistake, or misfortune could not have been offered before the director or authorized agent, it shall remand the case to the director or authorized agent to receive and consider such additional evidence.
