&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 263:5-a Application by New Resident. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a person who has established residency as provided in RSA 263:35 applies for a driver's license the director shall not issue a driver's license to the applicant until he or she has:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Determined the validity of all licenses being surrendered;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Secured a certified copy of the motor vehicle record or records on file in any jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which the applicant has held a license within the past 10 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The director shall establish a new driver record for a person who applies for a driver's license as described in paragraph I and shall include any conviction for an offense which occurred in another jurisdiction as long as such an offense, if committed in this state, would have been included in the driver record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The director may issue a temporary driver's license to a person who applies for a license under paragraph I until he receives the record and determines whether the person should be granted a driver's license.  The director may refuse to issue a temporary driver's license to a person who is under suspension or revocation in another jurisdiction or who would present a hazard to the safety of others.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The period for the temporary license may be extended or the temporary license renewed if the applicant would qualify for a driver's license suspension or revocation under the laws and rules of this state, until an opportunity for a hearing has been provided and a decision made on whether to issue a license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The director may satisfy the requirements of subparagraph I(b) by obtaining the applicant's record from the National Driver Record Repository, or by checking the applicant's record through the problem driver pointer system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A person who applies for a driver's license under paragraph I and provides false information shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 260:10 and RSA 263:12.
