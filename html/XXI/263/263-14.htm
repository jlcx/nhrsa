&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director, upon receiving proper application for an original driver's license, may in the director's discretion issue a license designated as an original, with such designation to be effective until the fifth anniversary of the license holder's date of birth following the date of issuance to allow such applicant to gain proper driving habits, attitudes, and experience.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The director shall issue a youth operator's license to applicants who are 16 years of age or older and under 21 years of age. The youth operator license shall expire on the 21st anniversary of the applicant's date of birth.  In addition to any other requirements established by law, no such license shall be issued to applicants under 18 years of age unless the applicant meets the requirements of RSA 263:17 or furnishes written consent from the applicant's parent or legal guardian and a certificate of successful completion of a driver education course as provided in RSA 263:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The holder of a youth operator's license shall not operate a motor vehicle between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., nor shall such holder operate a motor vehicle when the number of occupants exceeds the number of safety restraints in the vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) During the first 6 months after issuance of the license, the holder of a youth operator's license shall not operate a motor vehicle with more than one passenger less than 25 years of age who is not a member of the holder's family unless accompanied by a licensed responsible adult who is at least 25 years of age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Violation of RSA 263:14, II, (b) or (c) shall subject the violator to a fine not to exceed $100 and a license suspension not to exceed 30 days.  Subsequent violations shall subject the violator to a fine of not more than $200 and a license suspension of up to 90 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) This paragraph shall not apply to drivers licensed under RSA 263:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The restrictions set forth in RSA 263:14, II(b), (c), and (d) shall not apply to drivers who are over 18 years of age.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The director is authorized to revoke or suspend any original license held by a person under 20 years of age after a hearing upon a showing by its records or other sufficient evidence that the driver has committed an offense, excluding the offenses of RSA 261:40, RSA 261:59, and RSA 266:5, following the issuance of an original license for which the original license holder has been convicted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The periods of suspension or revocation set forth in subparagraph III(a) of this section shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) For a first offense 20 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For a second offense 45 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) For a third or subsequent offense 90 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A suspension or revocation imposed under this section shall not run concurrently with any other penalty imposed under the provisions of title XXI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The director, after hearing, may suspend or revoke an original license or any license held by a person under 20 years of age for good cause upon receipt of proper evidence or information of misconduct, misuse, or abuse of such driving privileges. Circumstances constituting misuse, abuse, or misconduct of driving privileges shall include driving behavior which poses an immediate hazard to the operator or to the safety or property of others on or near the roadway, or, when considered with other driving offenses, which demonstrates a repeated disregard for public safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding RSA 605:6 or any provision of law to the contrary, any conviction for an offense which is used as a basis for suspension or revocation of an original license under this section and which involves a plea of nolo contendere shall be treated in the same manner as a conviction which involves a guilty plea.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A driver who is under 18 years of age shall not be subject to license suspension for a first violation of RSA 265:107-a, I-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In addition to the other requirements of this section, the holder of a youth operator's license who is convicted of an offense under RSA 265-A shall not be eligible for reissuance of a license prior to the age of 21 unless the person satisfies the director after an administrative hearing that the person will drive in a safe manner if the license is issued.  The director may place such restrictions on any license so issued as the director deems in the best interest of public safety.
