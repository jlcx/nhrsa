&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this subdivision is to implement the federal Commercial Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (CMVSA), (Title XII of Public Law 99-570) and reduce or prevent commercial motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and injuries by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Permitting commercial drivers to hold only one license;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Disqualifying commercial drivers who have committed certain serious traffic violations, or other specified offenses;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Strengthening commercial driver licensing and testing standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This subdivision is a remedial law which should be liberally construed to promote the public health, safety, and welfare.  To the extent that this subdivision conflicts with general driver licensing provisions, this subdivision shall prevail.  Where this subdivision is silent, the general driver licensing provisions shall apply.
