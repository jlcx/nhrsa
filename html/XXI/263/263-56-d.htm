<codesect>
Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 263:56-a, the procedure for suspension of licenses and collection of payments for forfeited recognizances for driving offenses shall be in accordance with RSA 597:38-b.  Payments collected by the court under RSA 597:38-b shall be deposited into a special fund, known as the default bench warrant fund.  The commissioner may draw on such fund to pay the cost of state, county, and local law enforcement officials who make arrests pursuant to bench warrants issued for persons improperly at large for driving-related offenses up to a maximum amount of $100 per bench warrant.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the disbursement of moneys from the default bench warrant fund to pay the costs related to law enforcement officials and bench warrants.  The commissioner may also draw upon such fund to pay for costs associated with breath or blood alcohol testing, upon the recommendation of the advisory committee on breath analyzer machines pursuant to RSA 106-G:1.
