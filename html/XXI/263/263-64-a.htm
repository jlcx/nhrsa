The director, upon receiving a record of the conviction of any person upon a charge of driving a vehicle while the license of such person was suspended, may extend the period of such suspension for an additional period of the same duration as the suspension.  If the conviction was upon a charge of driving while a license was revoked, the director may refuse to issue a new license for an additional period of the same duration as the revocation, not to exceed one year from and after any date such person would otherwise have been entitled to apply for a new license.
