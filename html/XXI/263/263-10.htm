<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in RSA 263:14 and RSA 263:39-a, III, all licenses shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the license holder's date of birth following the date of issuance.  The department shall notify each holder of a license by mail addressed to the holder's last known address, or, if the license holder has so elected, by electronic, telephonic, or other means, 30 days prior to the expiration date thereof of a place and time when he or she shall appear for the issuance of a new license and any availability of electronic license renewal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I, the director may adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A providing for the renewal of driver licenses by applicants on-line rather than by appearing in person;  provided that the applicant is otherwise eligible for license renewal, is not required to submit to a road test under the provisions of RSA 263:7, has submitted proof sufficient to the director that he or she meets the visual acuity requirements for licensing, and has a computerized image on file with the division.  A license may be renewed on-line only once in every other license renewal cycle and the next cycle shall require appearance in person at a licensing facility.
