The department may issue a nonresident commercial driver license to a resident of a foreign jurisdiction if the United States Secretary of Transportation has determined that the commercial motor vehicle testing and licensing standards in the foreign jurisdiction do not meet the testing standards established in 49 CFR 383.  The word "nonresident'' shall appear on the face of the nonresident commercial driver license.  An applicant shall surrender any nonresident commercial driver license issued by another state.  Prior to issuing a nonresident commercial driver license, the department shall establish the practical capability of revoking, suspending, or cancelling the nonresident commercial driver license and disqualifying that person with the same conditions applicable to the commercial driver license issued to a resident of the state of New Hampshire.  A foreign driver applying for a nonresident commercial driver license shall complete all of the New Hampshire requirements for a commercial driver license.  In addition, holders of a nonresident commercial driver license shall notify the department of issuance of any disqualifications or license suspensions or revocations, whether in the United States or in the foreign driver's country of domicile.
