<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in RSA 263:25, II or when driving with a commercial driver learner permit and accompanied by the holder of a commercial driver license valid for the vehicle being driven, no person shall drive a commercial motor vehicle unless the person holds and is in immediate possession of a commercial driver license valid for the vehicle being driven.  For the purpose of making the transition from the previous driver license classification system to the commercial driver license system established in this subdivision, a person may drive a vehicle while in possession of a valid, unexpired driver's license;  provided that on or after April 1, 1992, or such other date as may be established by the federal government, no person shall drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he has a commercial driver license as required by this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A commercial driver license may be issued only to a person who drives or will drive commercial motor vehicles and who is domiciled in this state;  provided that a nonresident CDL may be issued pursuant to RSA 263:89.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A commercial driver license may not be issued to a person during a period in which the person is disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehicle, or while the person's driver's license is suspended, revoked, or cancelled in any state;  nor may a commercial driver license be issued to a person who has a commercial driver license issued by any other state unless the person first surrenders the commercial driver license issued by the other state, which license shall be returned to the issuing state for cancellation.
