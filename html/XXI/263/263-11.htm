I. Any person who is a member of the armed forces of the United States and who, at the time of induction, call to active duty, or enlistment in the armed forces for 2 or more years, was a resident of this state and was a holder of a valid New Hampshire license to drive motor vehicles in this state, is entitled to renewal of such license without cost by application to the division.  Said application must be accompanied by a letter giving date of expiration of active duty, signed by a commissioned officer.  Such a person while driving a motor vehicle shall carry upon his or her person the license issued.  The privilege of this section remains in effect for 90 days after the discharge or release of such a person from active duty.  Nothing in this section permits a person against whom a revocation or suspension of license is in force, or a person who has been refused a license by the director, to drive a motor vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any member of the national guard who is called to military service or mobilized for a period of 60 days or more, and who was a resident of this state and was a holder of a valid New Hampshire license to drive motor vehicles in this state, is entitled to renewal of such license without cost or penalty by application to the division.  Said application must be accompanied by a letter giving a projected date of expiration of said service, signed by a commissioned officer.  Such a person while driving a motor vehicle shall carry upon his or her person the license issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) A person who, at the time of license expiration, is deployed on active duty in the armed forces of the United States or serving in the national guard outside the state of New Hampshire, is a federal employee assigned to a location outside the United States, or is the spouse of any such person accompanying his or her spouse during the deployment, service, or assignment, may renew his or her license by mail, provided the person has a computerized image on file with the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If such person does not have an image on file with the division, he or she may request that a license be issued without a picture.  This non-photo license shall only be valid when accompanied by a military or United States government employee or dependent photo identification.  The person shall obtain a photo identification within 30 days of returning to this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a person renews his or her license by mail pursuant to paragraph III, the subsequent license renewal shall require an appearance in person at the licensing facility, except that if the person is on active duty outside of the state of New Hampshire in the armed forces of the United States for a period covering more than one license expiration, the person may renew his or license by mail as many times as is necessary during the period of active duty.
