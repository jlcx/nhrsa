For the purpose of identifying habitually reckless or negligent drivers and habitual or frequent violators of traffic regulations governing the movement of vehicles, the director shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 260:5 establishing a uniform system assigning demerit points for convictions of violations of this title.  The rules shall include a designated level of point accumulation which so identifies drivers.  The director may assess points for convictions in other states of offenses which, if committed in this state, would be grounds for such assessment.  Notice of the assessment of points may be given in accordance with rules adopted by the director.  No points shall be assessed for violating a provision of this title regulating standing, parking, equipment, size or weight.

The director shall not revoke or suspend a driver's license under the provisions of this section for a period in excess of one year except:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) In the case of a person whose license is suspended or revoked pursuant to RSA 263:56, I(g) the director may suspend or revoke a license for not more than 7 years.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) In the case of a person whose license is suspended or revoked pursuant to RSA 263:56, I(d) by reason of physical or mental impairment the director may suspend or revoke a license indefinitely provided that the person may request a hearing once every year thereafter for the purpose of reviewing the original order.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV.
