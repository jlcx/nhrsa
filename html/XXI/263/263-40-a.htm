&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) An applicant for a driver's license who has not previously been licensed to drive a motor vehicle in this state shall provide his or her social security number in the application.  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to determine whether to have his or her social security number retained in the records of the department of safety.  The application form shall include a box to check off if the applicant does not wish to have his or her social security number retained in the records of the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The application form for a renewal of a driver's license may request the social security number of the applicant.  An applicant who is a resident of New Hampshire shall be given the opportunity to determine whether to provide the social security number.  The application form shall include a box to check off if the applicant does not wish to provide his or her social security number pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The application form for an initial driver's license or a renewal of a driver's license shall include a box to check off if the applicant does not wish to have his or her computerized image, likeness, or photograph retained in the records of the department of safety.  The driver's license shall display the mailing address of the licensee and shall not display the licensee's social security number.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding RSA 91-A, RSA 260:14, RSA 261:60, or any other provision of law to the contrary, the social security number shall not be a public record open to the inspection of any person.  The department shall not sell or otherwise provide individual social security numbers or lists of social security numbers for any purpose which is not stated in this paragraph.  The department shall only make the social security number available to other states for driver record purposes, to any national driver information repository established pursuant to federal law, or, on their request on a case by case basis (a) to a law enforcement agency that requires the social security number for investigative purposes, or (b) to the department of health and human services for use only in the administration of child support enforcement.
