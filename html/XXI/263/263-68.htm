&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 263:68 Suspension of License;  Recognizance Required on Appeal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever any person convicted of a violation of RSA 265:79 appeals, the municipal or district court or justice shall order the person appealing to recognize in the sum of $100, with sufficient sureties, to keep the peace and be of good behavior until such appeal has been finally disposed of.  If the person appealing fails to recognize in said sum, the municipal or district court or justice shall forthwith suspend the license of such person.  If during such appeal period, such person is convicted of another violation of RSA 265:79 unrelated to the prior conviction, the municipal or district court or the justice shall, upon receiving notice of such conviction, immediately suspend the license of such person, shall declare the recognizance forfeited, and shall request the county attorney to cause proceedings to be had immediately for the recovery of such forfeiture, such proceedings to be subject to the provisions of RSA 597:33, 34, 35, 36 and 38.  Upon suspension of the license of such person either upon failure to recognize after conviction or during the appeal period as hereinabove provided, in case of holders of New Hampshire licenses, the municipal or district court or justice shall return such licenses together with the court return to the department which shall not reissue said license until such person is acquitted.  If the person so appealing is convicted, and has had his license suspended during the appeal period for failure to recognize in the required sum, the period of suspension shall be computed from the date of the initial conviction.  If the person so appealing is convicted and has not had his license suspended because he has recognized in the required sum, or has had his license suspended because of a second conviction during the appeal period, the period of suspension shall commence upon the date of his final conviction upon such appeal.
