&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue to every applicant a driver's license subject to such conditions as the commissioner may deem expedient and in such form as the commissioner may prescribe.  Licenses issued to persons under the age of 21 shall be designed so that their horizontal and vertical axes are opposite the horizontal and vertical axes of licenses issued to other persons, and said licenses shall prominently display the date on which the licensee shall attain the age of 21 years.  Consistent with RSA 263:14, the youth operator license shall expire on the 21st anniversary of the applicant's date of birth, at which time the applicant shall be issued a traditional license.  The license shall bear thereon a distinguishing number assigned to the licensee and an instant full-face color photograph, image, or likeness of the licensee.  There shall also be provided a space wherein the licensee may indicate his or her honorable veteran's status for purposes of identification for receiving benefits and services under New Hampshire law if the licensee so desires.  The license shall bear a special designation or symbol indicating honorable veteran's status for licensees who indicate such veteran status.  The driver's license card shall bear an approved security marking indicating that it was not issued in compliance with Public Law 109-13 and is therefore not acceptable for federal identification purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Drivers' licenses compliant with Public Law 109-13 issued pursuant to RSA 263:14-b shall bear the name, address, date of birth, veteran's status for the purposes of identification for receiving benefits and services under New Hampshire law (optional), organ donor status (optional), picture, and signature of the applicant.  The driver's license card shall bear an approved security marking indicating that it was issued in compliance with Public Law 109-13 and is therefore acceptable for federal identification purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Enhanced drivers' licenses issued pursuant to RSA 263:14-c shall bear the name, address, date of birth, veteran's status for the purposes of identification for receiving benefits and services under New Hampshire law (optional), organ donor status (optional), picture, and signature of the applicant.  The driver's license card shall bear an approved security marking indicating that it is an enhanced driver's license.
