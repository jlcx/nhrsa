I. The director, upon receiving proper application for an original driver's license, may in the director's discretion issue a license designated as an original, with such designation to be effective until the fifth anniversary of the license holder's date of birth following the date of issuance to allow such applicant to gain proper driving habits, attitudes, and experience.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The director shall issue a youth operator's license to applicants who are 16 years of age or older and under 21 years of age. The youth operator license shall expire on the 21st anniversary of the applicant's date of birth.  In addition to any other requirements established by law, no such license shall be issued to applicants under 18 years of age unless the applicant meets the requirements of RSA 263:17 or furnishes written consent from the applicant's parent or legal guardian and a certificate of successful completion of a driver education course as provided in RSA 263:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The holder of a youth operator's license shall not operate a motor vehicle between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., nor shall such holder operate a motor vehicle when the number of occupants exceeds the number of safety restraints in the vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) During the first 6 months after issuance of the license, the holder of a youth operator's license shall not operate a motor vehicle with more than one passenger less than 25 years of age who is not a member of the holder's family unless accompanied by a licensed responsible adult who is at least 25 years of age.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The director is authorized to revoke or suspend any original license held by a person under 20 years of age after a hearing upon a showing by its records or other sufficient evidence that the driver has committed an offense, excluding the offenses of RSA 261:40, RSA 261:59, and RSA 266:5, following the issuance of an original license for which the original license holder has been convicted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(d) The director, after hearing, may suspend or revoke an original license or any license held by a person under 20 years of age for good cause upon receipt of proper evidence or information of misconduct, misuse, or abuse of such driving privileges. Circumstances constituting misuse, abuse, or misconduct of driving privileges shall include driving behavior which poses an immediate hazard to the operator or to the safety or property of others on or near the roadway, or, when considered with other driving offenses, which demonstrates a repeated disregard for public safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding RSA 605:6 or any provision of law to the contrary, any conviction for an offense which is used as a basis for suspension or revocation of an original license under this section and which involves a plea of nolo contendere shall be treated in the same manner as a conviction which involves a guilty plea.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In addition to any other authority provided by law, the director is hereby authorized to revoke or suspend any license, permit or certificate issued under this title after a hearing upon a showing by its records or other sufficient evidence that the driver or boat operator:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Has committed an offense for which mandatory revocation of license is required upon conviction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Has been convicted with such frequency of serious offenses against traffic regulations governing the movement of vehicles as to indicate a disrespect for traffic laws and a disregard for the safety of other persons on the highways;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Is an habitually reckless or negligent driver of a motor vehicle, as established by the point system set up pursuant to paragraph II, by a record of accidents, or by other evidence;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle by reason of physical, mental or moral impairment.  For purposes of this paragraph, a license suspension or revocation on the basis of moral impairment shall be predicated only upon a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Has fraudulently or unlawfully used, permitted to be used, altered, displayed, or manufactured a license, has in his possession an altered or false license, or has been convicted of any offense specified under RSA 263:12;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Has violated his written promise to appear given to an officer upon the issuance of a traffic citation in this or any other state or has failed to appear in court in this or any other state at the time specified by the court;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Has by reckless or unlawful operation of a motor vehicle or boat caused or materially contributed to an accident resulting in death or injury to any other person or serious property damage;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Is a hazard to the public safety as evidenced by proper evidence or information received from a law enforcement agency of misconduct or misuse or abuse of driving privileges;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Has been determined to be the owner of an abandoned vehicle that has been removed pursuant to a request by a peace officer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purpose of identifying habitually reckless or negligent drivers and habitual or frequent violators of traffic regulations governing the movement of vehicles, the director shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 260:5 establishing a uniform system assigning demerit points for convictions of violations of this title.  The rules shall include a designated level of point accumulation which so identifies drivers.  The director may assess points for convictions in other states of offenses which, if committed in this state, would be grounds for such assessment.  Notice of the assessment of points may be given in accordance with rules adopted by the director.  No points shall be assessed for violating a provision of this title regulating standing, parking, equipment, size or weight.  However, points may be assessed for convictions involving abandoned vehicles as provided in RSA 262:40-c, and points may be assessed against any person who is found by the director to have abandoned a vehicle and who has not satisfied the reasonable costs of removal and storage.  In case of the conviction of a licensee of 2 or more traffic violations committed on a single occasion, such licensee shall be assessed points for one offense only and if the offenses involved have different point values, such licensee shall be assessed for the offense having the greater point value.  The director is authorized to suspend or revoke the license of a driver when his driving record identifies him as an habitually reckless or negligent driver or an habitual or frequent violator under this section.  The director may, in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this section, order the licensee to attend a group or private driver improvement interview regarding his driving ability and record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Notwithstanding RSA 605:6 or any other provision of law to the contrary, any conviction for an offense which is used as a basis for suspension or revocation of a license under this section and which involves a plea of nolo contendere shall be treated in the same manner as a conviction which involves a guilty plea for the purpose of assessing demerit points under paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The director shall not revoke or suspend a driver's license under the provisions of this section for a period in excess of one year except:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of a person whose license is suspended or revoked pursuant to RSA 263:56, I(g) the director may suspend or revoke a license for not more than 7 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of a person whose license is suspended or revoked pursuant to RSA 263:56, I(d) by reason of physical or mental impairment the director may suspend or revoke a license indefinitely provided that the person may request a hearing once every year thereafter for the purpose of reviewing the original order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In proceedings concerning accidents involving motor vehicle fatalities or serious injury, the director shall not give weight to the lack of a criminal prosecution relative to the accident in making his decision concerning license suspension or revocation.  In any hearing conducted under the provisions of this section regarding a fatality, the decedent's next of kin shall receive notice of the hearing, shall have the right to be present at the hearing, and shall be permitted to testify at the hearing.  In any hearing conducted under the provisions of this section regarding a serious injury, any seriously injured person shall receive notice of the hearing, shall have the right to be present at the hearing, and shall be permitted to testify at the hearing.  The decedent's next of kin or any seriously injured person, if aggrieved by the director's order, shall have standing under RSA 263:76 to file a petition of review in the superior court for review of the questions of law in the director's order.  If an appeal is made under RSA 263:76 concerning an accident involving a motor vehicle fatality or serious injury, the decedent's next of kin or any seriously injured person shall be notified of the filing of the appeal and the date of the appeal hearing and shall have the right to make a written statement to the court at the time of the hearing.  The director shall be deemed to have complied with this paragraph provided that he has notified by certified mail with return receipt requested the seriously injured person or at least one of the next of kin who is, if possible, of the age of majority and listed in RSA 259:66-a and who has been identified as a result of a review of division records or of information made known to the division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The director shall adopt rules as part of the point system required by paragraph II, establishing lesser point totals for suspension or revocation of driver's licenses of younger drivers including separate categories for drivers who are under the ages of 21 and 18, respectively.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fails to pay a fine or other penalty imposed in connection with a conviction of any offense which a court has determined he is able to pay, or issues a bad check in payment of a fine or other penalty;  or
<br>

(c) Fails to comply with a similar order of the director or a court on any matter within the director's or court's jurisdiction, his driver's license or resident or nonresident driving privilege and in any motor vehicle case or related case the resident plates and motor vehicle registration shall be suspended or revoked only upon written consent of the director, effective 30 days after such default or failure, except as provided in subparagraph I(d) of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a defendant receives a summons in hand from a law enforcement officer, no further notification to such defendant is required before the suspension of his driving privileges occurs as provided in subparagraph I(c).  If a defendant receives a summons in any manner other than in hand by a law enforcement officer, the court or director, as applicable, shall notify such defendant by certified mail at his last known address that his driving privileges shall be suspended 30 days after the mailing of such notification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Is a sexual offender as defined in RSA 651-B:1, IV or an offender against children as defined in RSA 651-B:1, VI, and fails to comply with the registration requirements under RSA 651-B, and where the failure to comply persists for more than 30 days, the offender's driver's license or resident or nonresident driving privileges shall be suspended or revoked by the director under this section, provided, that the department shall first attempt to notify the offender in person, or by first class mail, return receipt requested, sent to the offender's last known address, that he or she is in violation of the registration requirements and that his or her driving privileges will be suspended or revoked if he or she fails to comply with the registration requirements within 15 days of the department's attempted notice of noncompliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The department shall cause written notice to be sent to any driver licensed by or person whose vehicle is registered by the state of New Hampshire who defaults as otherwise provided in this section on an appearance, summons, or court order issued in this state.  Any person who defaults as provided in subparagraph I(c) shall be required to produce proof of satisfaction of the default either in hand or through the court to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) If such defendant fails to appear, pay the fine or comply with an order within the applicable period, as provided in subparagraph I(c) or (d) of this section, or fails to demonstrate that the defendant is financially unable to pay the fine or to comply with the order within the applicable period, the director shall suspend such defendant's driver's license or resident or nonresident driving privilege effective from the applicable date for an indefinite period and mark the defendant's files accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The director shall purge the record of violations in default, related suspensions, and all fees and fines assessed against these defaults and suspensions under this section that have been on file for more than 7 years;  provided, however, that the director shall not purge such records for a violation of RSA 265:79, RSA 265-A:2, I, RSA 265-A:3, RSA 265:115, RSA 265:117, and any offense which is a misdemeanor or felony during the defendant's lifetime until the defendant's driver's license or driving privilege is reinstated.

(c) The director shall report the names of all persons whose driver's licenses and driving privileges are suspended under this section to the National Driver Register administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The director may report the names of all persons whose driver's licenses and driving privileges are suspended under this section, due to nonpayment, to a consumer reporting agency as defined in RSA 359-B:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Under no circumstances shall the director suspend, revoke, or fail to renew a driver's license for failure to pay taxes to a state other than New Hampshire.  The director, upon receipt of request by a driver, accompanied by substantial evidence that a New Hampshire driver license suspension is the result of an out-of-state conviction for failure to pay taxes or an offense not pursuant to New Hampshire state law shall either restore the driver's New Hampshire driving privilege or forward the request to the bureau of hearings for a hearing to evaluate the evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in paragraph IV, the license or driving privilege of any defendant whose license or privilege has been suspended pursuant to paragraph II shall be reinstated upon:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Payment to the director of a fee of $100, which shall be in lieu of any other reinstatement fee and shall be deposited into the highway fund pursuant to RSA 260:23 and RSA 6:12, I(b)(5), provided, however, that in the event of a license suspension under RSA 263:14, a fee of $50 shall be paid to the director in lieu of the reinstatement fee under RSA 263:42, V and shall be deposited into the highway fund pursuant to RSA 260:23 and RSA 6:12, I(b)(5);  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Appearance by such defendant, payment of his fine, or compliance with the order of the director, as applicable, or upon demonstration that such defendant is financially unable to pay the fine or to comply with the order.  Any court which has ordered a suspension or revocation pursuant to paragraph II shall vacate the order and so notify the director and the affected defendant immediately after such defendant has appeared or paid his fine, as applicable, or has demonstrated that he is financially unable to pay the fine or to comply with the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No license or driving privilege or plates suspended or revoked under this section shall be reinstated before the expiration of any other period of suspension or revocation in effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing shall prevent any person affected by this section from obtaining a prompt review or hearing, upon showing just cause, before either the court or director for appropriate relief.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The provisions of this section shall be the primary sanction for defendants who fail to appear, pay a fine, or other penalty or comply with an order of the director or a court, but shall not exclude other provisions of law relative to sanctions for defendants who fail to appear, pay a fine, or other penalty or comply with an order of the director or a court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon application, the commissioner may, as justice may require, waive the driver's license suspension of any New Hampshire resident whose license or driving privileges have been suspended in this state or another state for a default on a non-drug or alcohol-related offense, where the default is more than 5 years old.  This paragraph shall not apply to offenses which are misdemeanors or felonies.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who is not yet 21 years of age on the date of the incident, who is convicted, found to be delinquent under RSA 169-B, or found to be in need of services under RSA 169-D, for any offense involving the sale, possession, use, or abuse of alcohol or of controlled drugs as defined in RSA 318-B:1, VI, or of a controlled drug analog as defined under RSA 318-B:1, VI-a, may at the discretion of the court be subject to the revocation or denial of a driver's license or privilege to drive for not less than 90 days but not more than one year on the first finding or conviction under this paragraph, and not less than 6 months but not more than 2 years for a subsequent finding or conviction.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the court from requiring any person subject to its provisions from successfully completing any alcohol or substance abuse education program in lieu of a loss or denial of driving license or privilege.  The director, upon receipt of a notification from the court that the court has ordered the suspension of a person's license or driving privilege pursuant to this paragraph, shall forthwith issue a formal order of suspension and, in the case of denial of an application for a license, the period imposed shall begin on the date the person is eligible by age for the issuance of a license.  Notwithstanding RSA 169-B:35 or any other law regarding confidentiality, any court which convicts or makes a finding that an offense described in this section has occurred involving a person who meets the age limits specified in this section, and which orders the revocation or denial of a driver's license or privilege to drive, shall forward a notice of such conviction or finding to the director.  The director shall maintain the confidentiality of notices received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The director shall, when ordered by the court, revoke the driver's license or privilege to drive or deny an application for a license for not less than 90 days but not more than one year on the first finding or conviction under paragraph I, and not less than 6 months but not more than 2 years for a subsequent finding or conviction;  provided, however, that the director shall not revoke or deny a license or privilege to drive under this paragraph without first giving the person an opportunity for a hearing to determine that the person is the individual who was convicted of the offense and against whom the court order applies.  In the case of denial of an application for a license, the period imposed shall begin on the date the person is eligible by age for the issuance of a license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who is not yet 18 years of age on the date of the incident, and who is convicted, found to be delinquent under RSA 169-B, or found to be in need of services under RSA 169-D, for the offense of sale or possession with intent to sell controlled drugs as defined in RSA 318-B:1, VI or a controlled drug analog as defined under RSA 318-B:1, VI-a, shall be subject to revocation or denial of a driver's license or privilege to drive for a mandatory period of at least one year and a maximum period of up to 5 years.  In the case of denial of an application for a license under this section, the period imposed shall begin on the date the person is eligible by age for the issuance of a license.

IV. The driver's license of any person who is 18 years of age or older on the date of the incident, and who is convicted of the offense of sale or possession with intent to sell controlled drugs as defined in RSA 318-B:1, VI or a controlled drug analog as defined under RSA 318-B:1, VI-a, may be revoked, at the discretion of the court, for any period of time, including for life.  The court of relevant jurisdiction shall have the discretion to determine when the revocation shall begin.

The director shall also notify the owner that he or she may request an administrative hearing before the suspension takes effect.  A request for a hearing shall be in writing.  A request for a hearing received by the division more than 30 days from the date the notice is issued shall be denied as untimely.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The director shall, pursuant to RSA 541-A, adopt by rule, a uniform administrative fine schedule for violations.  The fine for each suspension of registration renewal privileges requested by the commissioner of transportation shall not exceed:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Whether the report from the department of transportation correctly identified the owner of the vehicle at the time of the incident;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A notice of violation may be based in whole or in part upon inspection of any photographic or other recorded image of a vehicle using the bridge or highway subject to a toll or charge.

Provided, however, that if the director revokes or suspends a driver's license under the provisions hereof, said driver, upon his written application to the department, shall be granted a hearing by the department within 15 days after the filing of said application.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person shall drive a motor vehicle in this state while the person's driver's license or privilege to drive is suspended or revoked by action of the director or the justice of any court in this state, or competent authority in the out-of-state jurisdiction where the license was issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A person who drives a motor vehicle in this state while such person's license or driving privilege is suspended or revoked shall be guilty of violating this section regardless of whether such person has a license on the effective date of such suspension or revocation.  Evidence that the notice of suspension or revocation was sent to the person's last known address as shown on the records of the division shall be prima facie evidence that the person was notified of the suspension or revocation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person who obtains or possesses an out-of-state license after such person's New Hampshire license or driving privilege has been revoked does not revive his or her driving privilege by having such out-of-state license, and such person shall be guilty of violating this section if he or she drives in the state while his or her New Hampshire license or driving privilege is suspended or revoked.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any person who violates this section by driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle or by operating or attempting to operate an OHRV or snowmobile in this state during the period of suspension or revocation of his or her license or driving privilege for a violation of RSA 265:79 or an equivalent offense in another jurisdiction shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  Any person who violates this section by driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle or by operating or attempting to operate an OHRV or snowmobile in this state during the period of suspension or revocation of his or her license or driving privilege for a violation of RSA 265-A:2, I, RSA 265-A:3, RSA 630:3, II, RSA 265:82, or RSA 265:82-a or an equivalent offense in another jurisdiction shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a period not less than 7 consecutive 24-hour periods to be served within 6 months of the conviction, shall be fined not more than $1,000, and shall have his or her license or privilege revoked for an additional year.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding the definition of "revocation'' in RSA 259:90 and the definition of "suspension'' in RSA 259:107, the phrase "period of suspension or revocation'' as used in paragraph IV and for purposes of paragraph IV only shall mean only suspension or revocation imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.  "Period of suspension or revocation'' shall include the period specifically designated and until the restoration of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive.

Evidence that the driver violated any of the rules of the road shall be prima facie evidence that the driver caused or materially contributed to the collision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person violating this section whose license or driving privilege has been suspended pursuant to the provisions of RSA 263:14 only shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
<br>

VI. Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor upon conviction based upon a complaint which alleged that the person has had one or more prior convictions for driving after revocation or suspension in this state within the 7 years preceding the date of the second or subsequent offense.
<br>

Jurisdiction to hear such appeals is vested in the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At the earliest practical time, the court shall review the record as developed before the director or authorized agent, together with any written legal argument presented to the court.  Based on that review, the court may affirm or reverse the decision of the director or agent or order that oral argument be held.  As justice may require, the court may remand the case to the director or authorized agent for further findings or rulings.  In no event shall the oral argument be held less than 14 days after notice has been provided to the director.  The petition for appeal shall set forth all the grounds upon which the final order is sought to be overturned.  Issues not raised by the appellant before the director or agent shall not be raised before the superior court.  The burden of proof shall be upon the appellant to show that the decision of the director or agent was clearly unreasonable or unlawful, and all findings of the director or agent upon all questions of fact properly before him shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable.  The order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law, unless the court is satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence before it, that the order is unjust or unreasonable.

III. No new or additional evidence shall be introduced in the superior court, but the case shall be determined upon the record and evidence transferred, except that in any case, if it shall be necessary in order that no party shall be deprived of any constitutional right, or if the court shall be of the opinion that justice requires the reception of evidence of facts which have occurred since the hearing, or which by reason of accident, mistake, or misfortune could not have been offered before the director or authorized agent, it shall remand the case to the director or authorized agent to receive and consider such additional evidence.

</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Article I. Findings and Declaration of Policy</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The party states find that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.
