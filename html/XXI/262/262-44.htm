I. Such defendant shall receive, in addition to the summons, a uniform fine schedule entitled "Notice of Fine, Division of Motor Vehicles'' which shall contain the normal fines for violations of the provisions of title XXI on vehicles for which a plea may be entered by mail.  The defendant shall be given a notice of fine indicating the amount of the fine plus penalty assessment at the time the summons is issued;  except if, for cause, the summoning authority wishes the defendant to appear personally.  Defendants summoned to appear personally shall do so on the arraignment date specified in the summons, unless otherwise ordered by the court.  Defendants who are issued a summons and notice of fine and who wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere shall enter their plea on the summons and return it with payment of the fine plus penalty assessment to the director of the division of motor vehicles within 30 days of the date of the summons.  The director of the division of motor vehicles may accept payment of the fine by credit card in lieu of cash payment.  Any transaction costs assessed by the issuer of the credit card shall be paid out of the portion of the fine amount which is credited as agency income and not out of the penalty assessment charged by the district court.  The director of the division of motor vehicles shall remit the penalty assessments collected to the police standards and training council for deposit in the police standards and training council training fund and to the state treasurer to be credited and continually appropriated to the victims' assistance fund and the judicial branch information technology fund in the percentages and manner prescribed in RSA 188-F:31.  Fines shall be paid over to the state treasurer, and shall be credited as agency income by the department of safety within 14 days of their receipt.

The defendant shall be given a notice of fine indicating the amount of the fine plus penalty assessment at the time the summons is issued;  except if, for cause, the summoning authority wishes the defendant to appear personally.

Defendants who are issued a summons and notice of fine and who wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere shall enter their plea on the summons and return it with payment of the fine plus penalty assessment to the director of the division of motor vehicles within 30 days of the date of the summons.  The director of the division of motor vehicles may accept payment of the fine by credit card in lieu of cash payment.  Any transaction costs assessed by the issuer of the credit card shall be paid out of the portion of the fine amount which is credited to the general fund and not out of the penalty assessment charged by the district court.  The director of the division of motor vehicles shall remit the penalty assessments collected to the police standards and training council for deposit in the police standards and training council training fund and to the state treasurer to be credited and continually appropriated to the victims' assistance fund and the judicial branch information technology fund in the percentages and manner prescribed in RSA 188-F:31.

In cases where the defendant has defaulted on a court obligation, the court shall determine what the fine would be upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and shall impose an administrative processing fee in addition to the fine and penalty assessment.  In any case, the defendant's driving privileges shall be suspended as provided in RSA 263:56-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whenever a defendant otherwise fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance in connection with a summons for any violation level offense for which a defendant may plea by mail, the court shall proceed to hear the state's evidence, by offer of proof or otherwise, and enter a finding in accordance therewith.  If a finding of guilty is made, the court shall set the fine, and the clerk shall mail or deliver to the defendant's last known address a notice of finding and imposition of fine form approved by the administrative justice of the district court, appointed under supreme court rule.  Payment in full shall be required within 30 days from the date of the notice.  Any defendant who fails to make the payment shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 262:44, III(a)(1)-(2).
