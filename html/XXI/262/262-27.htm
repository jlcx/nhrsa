I. Other provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, a police officer making an arrest for a traffic violation shall issue a citation as appropriate to any motorist who is a resident of or holds a license issued by a reciprocating state and shall not, subject to the exceptions noted in RSA 262:27, II, require such motorist to post bail or bond to secure appearance for trial, but shall accept such motorist's personal recognizance that he will comply with the terms of such citation;  provided, however, that a person so arrested shall have the right upon his request to post bail or bond in a manner provided by law and, in such case, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No motorist shall be entitled to receive a citation under the provisions of RSA 262:27, I, nor shall any police officer issue such citation under said paragraph, if the offense for which the citation would be issued is one of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An offense for which the issuance of a citation in lieu of a hearing or the posting of collateral or bond is prohibited by the laws of this state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An offense, the conviction of or the forfeiture of collateral for which requires the suspension or revocation of the motorist's license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the failure of any nonresident to comply with the terms of such a traffic citation, the court having jurisdiction may issue a warrant for his arrest and he shall be subject to the penalty provisions of RSA 642:8.  The court shall notify the department of the failure of the cited nonresident to appear.  Said notification shall clearly identify the person arrested;  describe the violation, specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated;  shall indicate the location of the offense, give description of vehicle involved, and show the registration or license number of the vehicle.
