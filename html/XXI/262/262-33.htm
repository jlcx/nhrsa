&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 262:33 Procedure for Removal and Impoundment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon satisfying the requirements of RSA 262:32, such vehicle may be removed and stored in a suitable place, and all reasonable charges incurred as a result of such removal and storage shall be a lien against the vehicle which shall be paid by the owner, custodian, or person claiming such vehicle, except as otherwise provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever a vehicle is towed pursuant to RSA 262:32 the owner or other person lawfully entitled to the possession of the vehicle shall be entitled to recover said vehicle and release of the above lien by payment of all reasonable towing and storage charges.  If the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle wishes to challenge whether there was sufficient grounds for towing and impoundment, he or she may pay over to the custodian of the vehicle an amount equal to the towing and storage charges to secure the release of such vehicle, and, within 15 days of the towing and impoundment, request in writing a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The hearing shall be held before the head of the law enforcement agency which employs the authorized official who caused the vehicle to be removed and stored, or his or her designee.  In the event such agency head or his or her designee determines sufficient grounds did not exist for the removal and storage of the vehicle, the law enforcement agency shall reimburse the owner or other person lawfully claiming possession for any amount paid to the custodian to secure release of the vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall prevent a review of the reasonableness of the towing or other action as may be permitted by laws of this state by a court of competent jurisdiction.
