If the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle wishes to challenge the reasonableness of the fee charged, the owner or other person may pay over to the custodian of the vehicle an amount equal to the towing and storage charges to secure the release of the vehicle, and, within 15 days of the release of the vehicle, request in writing a review by the commissioner of safety.  The commissioner of safety or designee shall review the claim to determine if there are sufficient grounds to conduct a hearing to determine whether the charge was reasonable.  If the commissioner or designee determines that a hearing is necessary, the hearing shall be scheduled by the bureau of hearings within 20 days after review by the commissioner, at which time the extent of removal and storage fees shall be determined.  The commissioner or designee shall approve or disapprove of the decision of the bureau of hearings within 7 days after the hearing was held.
