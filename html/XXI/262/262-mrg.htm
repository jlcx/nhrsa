<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h3>Section 262:19</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 262:19 Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When the director determines that any person is an habitual offender within the meaning of RSA 259:39, he shall issue an order requiring that person to appear for a hearing to show cause why he should not be barred from driving a motor vehicle upon the ways of this state.  The show cause order shall incorporate a certified transcript or abstract of the person's conviction record, which shall be prima facie evidence that the person named therein was duly convicted, by the court in which such conviction or holding was made, of each offense shown by such transcript or abstract.  If any person shall deny any of the facts stated in the transcript or abstract, he shall have the burden of proving that such is untrue.  For the purposes of this chapter, a plea of nolo contendere shown on such transcript or abstract shall not make the same inadmissible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a person denies he was convicted of any offense necessary for a holding that he is an habitual offender and if the director cannot, on the evidence available to him, make such a determination, the director may certify the decision of such issue to the court in which the conviction was made.  The court to which certification is made shall immediately conduct a hearing to determine the issue and send a certified copy of its final order determining the issue to the director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the director finds that the person is not the same person named in the transcript or that the abstract does not contain the number of valid convictions required by RSA 259:39, the proceeding shall be dismissed.  If the director finds that the person is the same person named in the transcript or abstract and that the person is an habitual offender, the director shall, by appropriate order, revoke the person's driver's license and direct the person not to drive a motor vehicle on the ways of this state for a period of one to 4 years effective upon the date of the order or upon dates of final conviction of the offense that resulted in certification.  All licenses or permits to operate a motor vehicle on the ways of this state must be surrendered to the director.  A copy of the order shall become part of the record of the division of motor vehicles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No conviction for an offense specified under RSA 259:39 shall be annulled until at least 7 years after the conviction date.  No court shall vacate, expunge, delete, cancel or otherwise remove such a conviction for at least 7 years subsequent to the conviction date, unless it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the conviction was illegal or otherwise improper and invalid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The director may use convictions obtained in another state for the offense of reckless operation, driving while intoxicated, operating after suspension or revocation, manslaughter resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle, and negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle for the purpose of certifying an habitual offender.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A person who had his license revoked pursuant to RSA 262:19, III prior to July 17, 1987, may petition the director after a minimum of one year of such revocation for restoration of his driving privileges.  The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the conditions under which the director may restore a driver's license revoked under such conditions prior to the expiration of the original period of revocation.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle on the ways of this state while an order of the director or the court prohibiting such driving remains in effect.  If any person found to be an habitual offender under the provisions of this chapter is convicted of driving a motor vehicle on the ways of this state while an order of the director or the court prohibiting such operation is in effect, he or she shall be guilty of a felony and sentenced, notwithstanding the provisions of RSA title LXII, to imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than 5 years.  No portion of the minimum mandatory sentence shall be suspended, and no case brought to enforce this chapter shall be continued for sentencing;  provided, however, that any sentence or part thereof imposed pursuant to this section may be suspended in cases in which the driving of a motor vehicle was necessitated by situations of apparent extreme emergency which required such operation to save life or limb.  Any sentence of one year or less imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be served in a county correctional facility.  The sentencing court may order that any such offender may serve his or her sentence under home confinement pursuant to RSA 651:19 based on the rules and regulations of the county correctional facility where the sentence is to be served for the minimum mandatory term or any portion thereof, provided the offender first serves 14 consecutive days of imprisonment prior to eligibility for home confinement.  Habitual offenders shall only be eligible for the home confinement program once per lifetime.  Any sentence of more than one year imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be served in the state prison.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purpose of enforcing this section, in any case in which the accused is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his license, permit or privilege to drive is suspended or revoked, or is charged with driving without a license, the court before hearing such charge shall determine whether such person has been held an habitual offender and by reason of such holding is barred from driving a motor vehicle on the ways of this state.  For the purposes of this section, in determining whether the person has been held an habitual offender and by reason of such holding is barred from driving a motor vehicle on the ways of this state, a certified copy of the individual's motor vehicle record on file with the division shall be as competent evidence in any court within this state as the original record would be if produced by the director as legal custodian thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding paragraph I, any person who qualifies under RSA 259:39 shall not be subject to the minimum mandatory provisions of paragraph I if, and only if, that person's certification was not based on any conviction under RSA 265-A:2, I or any misdemeanor or felony motor vehicle conviction pursuant to RSA title XXI, and that person has not been convicted of any such offense, or any reasonably similar offense in any jurisdiction within the United States and Canada, since the date of the certification;  provided, however, that any such person shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor and may be sentenced to one year or less.  Any person incarcerated on June 8, 1992, pursuant to certification as an habitual offender under RSA 259:39, who does not have a conviction under RSA 265-A:2, I involving a vehicle or any misdemeanor or felony motor vehicle convictions pursuant to RSA title XXI, may apply immediately to the superior court for sentence review and reduction.

I. Other provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, a police officer making an arrest for a traffic violation shall issue a citation as appropriate to any motorist who is a resident of or holds a license issued by a reciprocating state and shall not, subject to the exceptions noted in RSA 262:27, II, require such motorist to post bail or bond to secure appearance for trial, but shall accept such motorist's personal recognizance that he will comply with the terms of such citation;  provided, however, that a person so arrested shall have the right upon his request to post bail or bond in a manner provided by law and, in such case, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No motorist shall be entitled to receive a citation under the provisions of RSA 262:27, I, nor shall any police officer issue such citation under said paragraph, if the offense for which the citation would be issued is one of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An offense for which the issuance of a citation in lieu of a hearing or the posting of collateral or bond is prohibited by the laws of this state;  or

III. Upon the failure of any nonresident to comply with the terms of such a traffic citation, the court having jurisdiction may issue a warrant for his arrest and he shall be subject to the penalty provisions of RSA 642:8.  The court shall notify the department of the failure of the cited nonresident to appear.  Said notification shall clearly identify the person arrested;  describe the violation, specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated;  shall indicate the location of the offense, give description of vehicle involved, and show the registration or license number of the vehicle.

I. Upon satisfying the requirements of RSA 262:32, such vehicle may be removed and stored in a suitable place, and all reasonable charges incurred as a result of such removal and storage shall be a lien against the vehicle which shall be paid by the owner, custodian, or person claiming such vehicle, except as otherwise provided in this section.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever a vehicle is towed pursuant to RSA 262:32 the owner or other person lawfully entitled to the possession of the vehicle shall be entitled to recover said vehicle and release of the above lien by payment of all reasonable towing and storage charges.  If the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle wishes to challenge whether there was sufficient grounds for towing and impoundment, he or she may pay over to the custodian of the vehicle an amount equal to the towing and storage charges to secure the release of such vehicle, and, within 15 days of the towing and impoundment, request in writing a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The hearing shall be held before the head of the law enforcement agency which employs the authorized official who caused the vehicle to be removed and stored, or his or her designee.  In the event such agency head or his or her designee determines sufficient grounds did not exist for the removal and storage of the vehicle, the law enforcement agency shall reimburse the owner or other person lawfully claiming possession for any amount paid to the custodian to secure release of the vehicle.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All fees charged for the removal and storage of any vehicle caused to be removed by an authorized official pursuant to RSA 262:32 or RSA 262:40-a shall be reasonable, and may reflect market variables, including, but not limited to, distance traveled to and from the storage facility, vehicle size and weight, the amount of time needed to remove and store the vehicle, any special equipment needed, and personnel costs.  If the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle wishes to challenge the reasonableness of the fee charged, the owner or other person may pay over to the custodian of the vehicle an amount equal to the towing and storage charges to secure the release of the vehicle, and, within 15 days of the release of the vehicle, request in writing a review by the commissioner of safety.  The commissioner of safety or designee shall review the claim to determine if there are sufficient grounds to conduct a hearing to determine whether the charge was reasonable.  If the commissioner or designee determines that a hearing is necessary, the hearing shall be scheduled by the bureau of hearings within 20 days after review by the commissioner, at which time the extent of removal and storage fees shall be determined.  The commissioner or designee shall approve or disapprove of the decision of the bureau of hearings within 7 days after the hearing was held.  Notwithstanding RSA 262:25, any person aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner or designee under this section may appeal the decision to the superior court in the same manner as that prescribed in RSA 263:75, II and III.  If no request for review is filed within the 15-day period, the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle shall be deemed to have waived all rights to review under this section and shall be liable for the total amount billed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall prevent a review of the reasonableness of the towing or other action as may be permitted by laws of this state by a court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any time that a person is storing a vehicle pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the person may remove any items from within the vehicle that are not a part of or accessories to the vehicle.  The person may hold any such items, other than wallets, purses, life essential clothing, mail, legal documents, car seats, eyeglasses, medicine, medical equipment, or house keys pending payment of any fees due under this subdivision.  If fees remain unpaid after 20 days, the person may dispose of the items.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Such defendant shall receive, in addition to the summons, a uniform fine schedule entitled "Notice of Fine, Division of Motor Vehicles'' which shall contain the normal fines for violations of the provisions of title XXI on vehicles for which a plea may be entered by mail.  The defendant shall be given a notice of fine indicating the amount of the fine plus penalty assessment at the time the summons is issued;  except if, for cause, the summoning authority wishes the defendant to appear personally.  Defendants summoned to appear personally shall do so on the arraignment date specified in the summons, unless otherwise ordered by the court.  Defendants who are issued a summons and notice of fine and who wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere shall enter their plea on the summons and return it with payment of the fine plus penalty assessment to the director of the division of motor vehicles within 30 days of the date of the summons.  The director of the division of motor vehicles may accept payment of the fine by credit card in lieu of cash payment.  Any transaction costs assessed by the issuer of the credit card shall be paid out of the portion of the fine amount which is credited as agency income and not out of the penalty assessment charged by the district court.  The director of the division of motor vehicles shall remit the penalty assessments collected to the police standards and training council for deposit in the police standards and training council training fund and to the state treasurer to be credited and continually appropriated to the victims' assistance fund and the judicial branch information technology fund in the percentages and manner prescribed in RSA 188-F:31.  Fines shall be paid over to the state treasurer, and shall be credited as agency income by the department of safety within 14 days of their receipt and shall not lapse to the general fund until the second year of each biennium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the defendant wishes to enter a not guilty plea, he shall enter such plea on the summons and return it to the division of motor vehicles within 30 days of the date of the summons.  The division shall transmit the plea to the appropriate court and the court shall schedule a trial.  Upon the conclusion of the trial, the court shall transmit the result of the trial to the division for division records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Whenever a defendant:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Does not enter a plea-by-mail with the director of the division of motor vehicles within 30 days of the date of the summons or, if required to appear in court personally, does not appear personally or by counsel at the court on or before the required date or move for a continuance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Fails to pay a fine or other penalty in connection with a conviction of a title XXI offense or payment of such fine or other penalty is uncollectible or unacceptable pursuant to RSA 6:11-a, the defendant shall be defaulted.  In cases where the defendant has failed to enter a plea-by-mail with the director, the director of designee shall determine what the fine would be upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and shall impose an administrative processing fee in addition to the fine and penalty assessment.  In cases where the defendant has defaulted on a court obligation, the court shall determine what the fine would be upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and shall impose an administrative processing fee in addition to the fine and penalty assessment.  In any case, the defendant's driving privileges shall be suspended as provided in RSA 263:56-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whenever a defendant otherwise fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance in connection with a summons for any violation level offense for which a defendant may plea by mail, the court shall proceed to hear the state's evidence, by offer of proof or otherwise, and enter a finding in accordance therewith.  If a finding of guilty is made, the court shall set the fine, and the clerk shall mail or deliver to the defendant's last known address a notice of finding and imposition of fine form approved by the administrative justice of the district court, appointed under supreme court rule.  Payment in full shall be required within 30 days from the date of the notice.  Any defendant who fails to make the payment shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 262:44, III(a)(1)-(2).  No finding made by the court shall be set aside except for cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In defaulted court cases for violations of title XXI, the court shall notify the director of the division of motor vehicles of the defendant's default, and the amounts of the fine and other penalties, on a form prescribed by the director or by electronic means.  The amount of the administrative processing fee shall be determined by the New Hampshire supreme court in accordance with the provisions of RSA 502-A:19-b, V and shall be retained by the court for the benefit of the state in those cases in which the fee is assessed by the court.  In other cases, the fee shall be retained by the department of safety for the benefit of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court may, in its discretion, issue a bench warrant for the arrest of any defendant who:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Has defaulted as provided in RSA 262:44, III;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Fails to comply with a similar court order of the director or a court on any matter within the director's or court's jurisdiction.
