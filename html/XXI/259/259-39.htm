&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 259:39 Habitual Offender. &#150;</b>

"Habitual offender'' means any resident or nonresident person whose record, as maintained in the office of the division, shows that such person has accumulated convictions in the number provided in paragraph I, II or III of this section for those offenses listed therein and committed within a 5-year period, based on the date of the offense.  After a conviction for an offense listed either in paragraph I or in paragraph II and during the 5-year period, if a subsequent single incident results in convictions for more than one offense under the same paragraph, each such conviction may be counted separately for the purpose of certifying a person as an habitual offender.
