&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 259:90 Revocation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
"Revocation'' shall mean the termination by formal action of the department or of a court of competent jurisdiction of a person's driver's license or privilege to drive on the ways of this state, or of any other license, registration or permit issued by the department.  After a license, registration, permit or privilege has been revoked, no application for reissue of said license, registration, permit, or privilege may be acted upon by the department until the expiration of the period of revocation.  The revocation of any license, registration, permit, or privilege shall remain in effect until a license, registration, or permit has been reissued or the privilege has been restored by the department.  If the license, registration, or permit expires during the period of revocation, the person shall be required to obtain a new license, registration, or permit at the regular fee.
