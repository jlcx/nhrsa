"Ignition interlock device'' shall mean breath alcohol ignition interlock device or enhanced technology ignition interlock device, which is a system or device that connects a breath analyzer to a motor vehicle's ignition system.  The analyzer measures the concentration of alcohol in the breath of any person who attempts to start the motor vehicle by using the ignition system.  The device prevents the vehicle from starting unless the person provides a breath sample with a concentration of alcohol that is below a preset level.  The device contains a data-logger which retains records of failures to take or pass the test during the period between recalibrations.
