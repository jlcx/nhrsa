<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Required to complete a department of health and human services approved impaired driver education program prior to the restoration of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive;  provided however, that if the person has previously completed such a program within the past 5 years and provides required proof, that shall serve as fulfillment of this requirement;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Out-of-state jurisdiction'' includes any governmental entity that issues driver's licenses that are valid for operating a motor vehicle on the ways of this state as provided in RSA 263:37, and that has laws relating to driving while impaired that are reasonably equivalent to the laws of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "IDCMP'' means an impaired driver care management program approved by the department of health and human services under RSA 265-A:40.

No portion of the minimum mandatory sentence of imprisonment and no portion of the mandatory sentence of the period of revocation and no portion of any fine imposed under this section shall be suspended or reduced by the court.  No case brought to enforce this section shall be continued for sentencing for longer than 35 days.  No person serving the minimum mandatory sentence under this section shall be discharged pursuant to authority granted under RSA 651:18, released pursuant to authority granted under RSA 651:19, or in any manner, except as provided in RSA 623:1, prevented from serving the full amount of such minimum mandatory sentence under any authority granted by RSA title LXII or any other provision of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any person convicted of a violation of RSA 265-A:2, RSA 265-A:3, or RSA 265-A:19, II, and who at the time of driving or attempting to drive a vehicle or off highway recreational vehicle or operating or attempting to operate a boat was transporting a person under the age of 16, shall have the driver's license or privilege to drive revoked for the maximum time period under the section violated and the person's license or privilege to drive shall not be restored until the offender has completed an IDCMP screening within 14 days of conviction, and if testing demonstrates the likelihood of a substance use disorder, the person shall schedule a substance use disorder evaluation within 30 days of conviction or within 30 days of release from the correctional facility, whichever occurs later, complete the required substance use disorder evaluation within 60 days of release from the correctional facility, comply with the service plan developed from the substance abuse disorder evaluation by the IDCMP, and complete a department of health and human services approved impaired driver education program prior to the restoration of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive;  provided however, that if the person has previously completed such a program within the past 5 years and provides required proof, that shall serve as fulfillment of this requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Any conviction under RSA 265-A:2, I or RSA 265-A:3 shall be reported to the department of safety, division of motor vehicles, and shall become a part of the motor vehicle driving record of the person convicted.
<br>
