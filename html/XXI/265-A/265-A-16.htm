&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 265-A:16 Blood Testing of Certain Motor Vehicle Fatalities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When a collision, boating accident, or OHRV accident results in death or serious bodily injury to any person, all drivers or operators involved, whether living or deceased, and all deceased vehicle, boat, or OHRV occupants and pedestrians involved shall be tested for evidence of alcohol or controlled drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, or any other chemical substances, natural or synthetic, which impair a person's ability to drive.  A law enforcement officer, authorized agent, or peace officer shall request a licensed physician, registered nurse, certified physician's assistant, or qualified medical technician or medical technologist to withdraw blood from each driver or operator involved if living and from the body of each deceased driver or operator, deceased occupant, or deceased pedestrian, in accordance with RSA 611-B:14, II, for the purpose of testing for evidence of alcohol content or controlled drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, or any other chemical substances, natural or synthetic, which impair a person's ability to drive;  provided that in the case of a living driver or operator the officer has probable cause to believe that the driver or operator caused the collision or accident.  All tests made under this section shall be conducted by the forensic science laboratory established in RSA 106-B:2-a or in any other laboratory capable of conducting such tests which is licensed under the laws of this or any other state and which has also been licensed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988, as amended.  A copy of the report of any such test shall be kept on file by the medical examiner.  The filed report is not a public record under RSA 91-A.  However, the report shall be made available to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any highway safety agency for use in compiling statistics to evaluate the effectiveness of its program;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person, including his or her legal representative, who is or may be involved in a civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding arising out of an accident in connection with which the test was performed.
