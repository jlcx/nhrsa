A treatment provider, who may also carry out substance use disorder evaluations, may be approved upon receipt of an application that demonstrates in equivalent fashion the professional capability, financial viability, pertinent experience, and potential longevity necessary to provide services.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall monitor IDCMP services and may withdraw the approval of an IDCMP or treatment provider upon receipt of reliable evidence that the entity has failed to meet the requirements of this section or is likely to act in a manner that threatens public safety or the welfare of a client.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII.
