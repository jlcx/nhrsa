I. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 651:5, no court shall order an annulment of any record of conviction of driving or attempting to drive a vehicle upon any way or driving, operating, attempting to operate, or being in actual physical control of an OHRV or operating or attempting to operate a boat on the waters of this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any controlled drug, prescription drug, over-the-counter drug, or any other chemical substance, natural or synthetic, which impairs a person's ability to drive or while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or of aggravated drunken driving until 10 years after the date of conviction.  Any record thus annulled shall be retained in a permanent file, to be opened only for purposes of sentencing in the case of an offense under RSA 265-A:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in any case in which a person is arrested for and charged with the offense of driving or attempting to drive a vehicle on any way or driving, operating, attempting to operate, or being in actual physical control of an OHRV or operating or attempting to operate a boat while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more and that charge is reduced from a second or subsequent offense to a first offense or in which the original charge is reduced to or in any manner substituted with another charge or a nolle prosequi entered in exchange for an agreement to plead guilty or nolo contendere to another charge, the prosecutor shall submit to the attorney general a written report describing such agreement.  All such written reports shall be submitted to the attorney general on a monthly basis.  The report shall contain such information as the attorney general shall prescribe;  provided, however, that the attorney general shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 541-A in prescribing such information.

I. If any person refuses a test as provided in RSA 265-A:14 or submits to a test described in RSA 265-A:4 which discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or, in the case of a person under the age of 21 at the time of the violation, 0.02 or more, the law enforcement officer shall submit a sworn report to the department.  In the report the officer shall certify that the test was requested pursuant to RSA 265-A:4 and that the person refused to submit to testing or submitted to a test which disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or, in the case of a person under the age of 21, 0.02 or more.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer submitted under paragraph I, the department shall suspend the person's driver's license or privilege to drive as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of a refusal to take a test described in RSA 265-A:4, the suspension shall be for the period specified in RSA 265-A:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of a person who submits to a test described in RSA 265-A:4 which discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or, in the case of a person under the age of 21 at the time of the violation, 0.02 or more, the suspension shall be for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Six months if there is no prior refusal under RSA 265-A:14, no prior driving while intoxicated or aggravated driving while intoxicated convictions, and no prior administrative license suspension pursuant to RSA 265-A:30.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Two years if there is a prior refusal under RSA 265-A:14, or a prior driving while intoxicated or aggravated driving while intoxicated conviction, or a prior administrative suspension pursuant to RSA 265-A:30.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. On behalf of the department, the law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under paragraph I shall serve immediate notice of suspension on the person, and the suspension shall be effective 30 days after the date of service.  If the person has a valid New Hampshire driver's license, an officer shall take the driver's license of the person, and issue a temporary license valid for the notice period.  The officer shall send the license to the department along with the sworn report under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the person submits to a test described in RSA 265-A:4 and the results of the test are not immediately available and therefore no notice has been served by the law enforcement officer, the department shall mail such notice and the suspension shall be effective 30 days after the date of service.  If the address shown in the law enforcement officer's report differs from that shown on the department records, the notice shall be mailed to both addresses.  The notice shall be presumed to have been served 3 days after mailing.  Upon receipt of the notice of suspension and before requesting any review or hearing under RSA 265-A:31, if the person has a New Hampshire driver's license that has not been surrendered, the person shall surrender such person's license at a place designated by the department and shall be issued a temporary driving permit valid for the notice period.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Any person whose license is suspended or revoked under this subdivision may request either an administrative review or a hearing.  The request shall be in writing and shall state the grounds upon which the person seeks to have the order of suspension or revocation rescinded, which grounds shall be limited to those provided in paragraph II.  The filing of the request shall not stay the suspension or revocation.  A request for either administrative review or hearing received by the department after 30 days from the date the notice is issued shall be denied as untimely.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the request is for an administrative review, the request may be accompanied by any statement or other evidence which the person wants the department to consider.  Upon receiving the request the department shall review the order, the evidence upon which it is based, including whether the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, and any other information brought to the attention of the department, and shall determine whether sufficient cause exists to sustain the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the request is for a hearing, the request shall also indicate whether or not the person desires to have the law enforcement officer present.  The hearing shall be held within 20 days after the filing of the request unless the person requests a continuance.  A request for a continuance by the person shall not stay the order of suspension or revocation.  The hearing shall be recorded, and be conducted by the department's designated agent.  The hearing may be conducted upon a review of the law enforcement officer's report if there is no request to have the officer present.  If there is a request that the law enforcement officer be present at the hearing and the officer fails to appear without good cause shown, the case shall be dismissed and the order rescinded.  If the person requesting the hearing fails to appear without good cause shown, the right to a hearing shall be waived and the order sustained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The scope of the administrative review or hearing shall be limited to the issues of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the arrested person had been driving, attempting to drive, or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state or operating or attempting to operate a boat on the waters of this state or was driving, operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of an OHRV while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, narcotics, or drugs;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The facts upon which the reasonable grounds to believe such are based;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the person had been arrested;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Whether the person has refused to submit to the test upon the request of the law enforcement officer or whether a properly administered test or tests disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or, in the case of a person under 21 years of age, 0.02 or more;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whether the officer informed the arrested person of his or her right to have a similar test or tests conducted by a person of his or her own choosing;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Whether the officer informed the arrested person of the fact that refusal to permit the test would result in suspension of his or her license or driving privilege and that testing above the alcohol concentration level specified in RSA 265-A:2 or RSA 265-A:3 would also result in suspension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of either an administrative review or a hearing, the hearing examiner shall issue his or her recommendation on the order of suspension or revocation within 15 days of the request for administrative review or the hearing date.  The recommendation shall be in writing and a copy shall be provided to the parties.  The recommendation shall be final unless a review or appeal is filed under RSA 265-A:33 or RSA 265-A:34.

In no event shall the oral argument be held less than 14 days after notice has been provided to the director.  The petition for appeal shall set forth all the grounds upon which the final order is sought to be overturned.  Issues not raised by the appellant before the director or agent shall not be raised before the superior court.  The burden of proof shall be upon the appellant to show that the decision of the director or agent was clearly unreasonable or unlawful, and all findings of the director or agent upon all questions of fact properly before him or her shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable.  The order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law, unless the court is satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence before it, that the order is unjust or unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No new or additional evidence shall be introduced in the superior court, but the case shall be determined upon the record and evidence transferred, except that in any case, if it shall be necessary in order that no party shall be deprived of any constitutional right, or if the court shall be of the opinion that justice requires the reception of evidence of facts which have occurred since the hearing, or which by reason of accident, mistake, or misfortune could not have been offered before the director or authorized agent, it shall remand the case to the director or authorized agent to receive and consider such additional evidence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 265-A:35 Probationary Licenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who shall apply for reissuance of his or her driver's license following revocation or suspension for an offense under RSA 265:79, RSA 265-A:2, RSA 265-A:3, or RSA 265-A:43 for an offense involving a vehicle is an "at risk'' driver and his or her driver's license shall be probationary for at least 5 years following the date of reissuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No holder of a probationary license shall drive or attempt to drive a vehicle upon any way when he or she is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any controlled drug, prescription drug, over-the-counter drug, or any other chemical substance, natural or synthetic, which impairs a person's ability to drive or any combination of intoxicating liquor and controlled drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, or any other chemical substances, natural or synthetic, which impair a person's ability to drive so that the alcohol concentration is 0.03 or more.  Driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.03 or more is a per se violation of a probationary license and subjects the probationary license holder to administrative suspension of his or her driver's license for not less than 90 days and not more than 180 days.  Such administrative suspension shall be in addition to any court imposed suspension or revocation periods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any probationary license holder whom the police have reasonable cause to believe is driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.03 or more and who refuses to submit to a test for alcohol concentration shall have his or her driver's license administratively suspended for a period of 90 days.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person whose license or permission to drive has been revoked or suspended for an aggravated DWI offense under RSA 265-A:18, I(b) or I(c), or a subsequent DWI offense under RSA 265-A:18, IV shall be required by the court after the period of revocation or suspension to install an ignition interlock device as defined in RSA 259:43-a in any vehicle registered to that person or used by that person on a regular basis, for not less than 12 months nor more than 2 years.  Installation and monitoring costs shall be paid by the offender.  A certificate proving installation of the device shall be provided to the division of motor vehicles as a condition precedent to reinstatement of the individual's license to drive, and the division may mark the person's license and the person's number plate by use of a striping sticker accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Any person who is convicted of driving while under suspension or revocation resulting from a DWI offense shall be required by the court to install an ignition interlock device in any vehicle registered to that person or used by that person on a regular basis, for the remaining period of suspension or revocation plus an additional period not less than 12 months nor more than 2 years.  The court may order such installation on a temporary basis prior to conviction as a condition of bail.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. To the extent that technology does not exist to permit the installation or safe operation of any particular vehicle type when equipped with an interlock, the court may order that a restraining device which disables the vehicle be placed on any such vehicle registered to or used on a regular basis by a person required to install an ignition interlock device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from requiring the installation of an ignition interlock device for any person convicted of a violation of RSA 265-A:2 involving a vehicle, where the conviction is not based upon a complaint which alleges prior convictions as provided in RSA 265-A:18, IV, but the person is found to have had one or more such prior convictions in this state or in an out-of-state jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person under the age of 21 whose license or permission to drive has been revoked or suspended under RSA 265-A:18 may be required by the court after the period of revocation or suspension to install an ignition interlock device as defined in RSA 259:43-a in any vehicle registered to that person or used by that person on a regular basis, until the age of 21 or for not less than 12 months, whichever is longer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. It shall be a violation for an ignition interlock device to be sold or distributed in this state without the device being approved by the commissioner or the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The department of safety shall establish rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, for the approval of ignition interlock devices and for the licensing of approved interlock service providers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner shall adopt rules and regulations to create an ignition interlock program that will control the delivery of interlock service in this state under this subdivision.  The rules adopted for the licensing of approved interlock service providers shall require that each provider, at a minimum:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide recalibration of each device within 30 days of installation and every 60 days thereafter, unless otherwise ordered by the court, or every 180 days when an enhanced technology ignition interlock device is being used;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Maintain at least that number of locations across the state for the installation, service, calibration, monitoring, and removal of an ignition interlock device as might be required from time to time by the program operating protocol developed by the commissioner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide periodic reports as determined by the court or in department rules, to the director of the division of motor vehicles, the department's interlock coordinator, and the court of jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Retain all data-logger records for 36 months after the end of the period to which the offender is sentenced;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Maintain a reserve account with a balance at least equal to 2 percent of the provider's revenue from interlock device service and installation in this state, excluding the purchase or rental costs of devices, during the previous calendar year.  Funds in the account shall be used to assist with the cost of the installation and service to those offenders determined by the court or the department to be unable to pay the full cost of an interlock program.  Offenders determined by the court or the department to be unable to pay the full cost of an interlock program shall, at a minimum, pay 25 percent of the cost for the installation and service.  Reserve account balances and costs to the provider for assisting with the cost of installation and service shall be reported annually to the department;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Provide a certificate of installation to the vehicle's owner and to the department's interlock coordinator upon installation of the device in a form to be determined by the department's interlock rules;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Provide reports to the department when data specified in department rules becomes available.  The department shall make data from the reports available to the director of the division of motor vehicles, appropriate prosecutor, prosecuting agency, treatment provider, probation officer, and defense attorney by means of authorizing the interlock provider to provide these entities with secure electronic access to the data via the interlock provider's web-based portal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 265-A:38-a Ignition Interlock Device Removal Protocol. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Prior to the removal of an ignition interlock device from a vehicle, the interlock service provider shall obtain from the department's interlock coordinator a certificate of removal effective on the expiration date of the interlock order provided the driver has not committed an interlock violation within the preceding 120-day period.  As used in this section "interlock violation'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Operating a motor vehicle without an interlock device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Soliciting or allowing any other person to provide a breath sample to an interlock device or to start an interlock equipped vehicle for the purpose of providing the person so restricted with an operable motor vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Using any means other than providing a breath sample directly from the operator's mouth into the device in order to supply an air sample to the device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An attempt to tamper with or circumvent the interlock device.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A failed rolling retest in which the operator's breath alcohol concentration registered at or above 0.05.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Two failed rolling retests within a single service period in which the operator's breath alcohol concentration registered above 0.03.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Two lockouts due to missed rolling retests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Two missed service visits.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph I(i) effective January 1, 2016.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) More than one attempt to start the vehicle with a breath alcohol concentration of 0.05 or above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the restricted person has more than one interlock violation within the 120 days prior to the request for removal of the interlock, the commissioner shall refuse to issue a removal certificate and shall order that the person continue to have an interlock device or enhanced technology interlock device in any vehicle registered to or used by that person for an additional period of 120 days or until the individual has been violation-free for such extended period, whichever is the later.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An operator who is identified as having committed an ignition interlock violation may request a hearing with the bureau of hearings to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether such violation occurred.  The department shall notify the operator of this right to a hearing, however the interlock shall not be removed from the vehicle while such hearing is pending.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If after a hearing the commissioner determines that the scope and nature of an operator's violations of the provisions of this section are so significant or flagrant that the interests of public safety are at risk, the commissioner may also revoke any vehicle registrations in the name of the operator, as well as the registrations of vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device the operator has access to, and prevent further registrations from issuing.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall publish a regularly-updated list of approved impaired driver care management programs (IDCMPs) and related treatment providers.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services may approve an IDCMP upon receipt of an application that demonstrates, in a manner satisfactory to the commissioner of the department of health and human services, that the applicant has the professional capability, financial viability, pertinent experience, and potential longevity necessary to provide the services required of an IDCMP under this chapter.  A treatment provider, who may also carry out substance use disorder evaluations, may be approved upon receipt of an application that demonstrates in equivalent fashion the professional capability, financial viability, pertinent experience, and potential longevity necessary to provide services.  The commissioner of the department of health and human services shall monitor IDCMP services and may withdraw the approval of an IDCMP or treatment provider upon receipt of reliable evidence that the entity has failed to meet the requirements of this section or is likely to act in a manner that threatens public safety or the welfare of a client.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An approved impaired driver care management program (IDCMP) shall provide the following services for persons arrested for or convicted of an offense under this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Screening of first-time offenders, using a screening test approved by the department of health and human services, to determine whether they need a full evaluation for substance use disorders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Conducting a full substance use disorder evaluation, as necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Development of a service plan based on this assessment of the client, which may include referral to education and/or treatment programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Monitoring of the services provided to the client under the service plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notifying the division of motor vehicles and the sentencing court if the client fails to comply with the service plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Periodic face-to-face evaluations of the client's progress.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Administration of drug and alcohol tests or other abstinence monitoring regimen required by the court or included in the service plan.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Before the service plan is finalized, the client shall provide to the program an original certified copy of the person's driver's license record.  Such record shall be secured from the division of motor vehicles, or from the state in which the person holds a driver's license, if an out-of-state resident.  The person shall pay for all costs involved in securing the certified copy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Persons receiving services from an impaired driver care management program and from education or treatment programs included in the service plan shall be responsible for the fees assessed by such programs, including a per-client fee paid by the program provider to the department of health and human services sufficient to cover the costs of monitoring program services, data collection, and administrative support by the department of health and human services.
