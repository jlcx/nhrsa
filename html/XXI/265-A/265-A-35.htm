&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who shall apply for reissuance of his or her driver's license following revocation or suspension for an offense under RSA 265:79, RSA 265-A:2, RSA 265-A:3, or RSA 265-A:43 for an offense involving a vehicle is an "at risk'' driver and his or her driver's license shall be probationary for at least 5 years following the date of reissuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No holder of a probationary license shall drive or attempt to drive a vehicle upon any way when he or she is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any controlled drug, prescription drug, over-the-counter drug, or any other chemical substance, natural or synthetic, which impairs a person's ability to drive or any combination of intoxicating liquor and controlled drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, or any other chemical substances, natural or synthetic, which impair a person's ability to drive so that the alcohol concentration is 0.03 or more.  Driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.03 or more is a per se violation of a probationary license and subjects the probationary license holder to administrative suspension of his or her driver's license for not less than 90 days and not more than 180 days.  Such administrative suspension shall be in addition to any court imposed suspension or revocation periods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any probationary license holder whom the police have reasonable cause to believe is driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.03 or more and who refuses to submit to a test for alcohol concentration shall have his or her driver's license administratively suspended for a period of 90 days.
