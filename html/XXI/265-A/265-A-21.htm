&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 651:5, no court shall order an annulment of any record of conviction of driving or attempting to drive a vehicle upon any way or driving, operating, attempting to operate, or being in actual physical control of an OHRV or operating or attempting to operate a boat on the waters of this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any controlled drug, prescription drug, over-the-counter drug, or any other chemical substance, natural or synthetic, which impairs a person's ability to drive or while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or of aggravated drunken driving until 10 years after the date of conviction.  Any record thus annulled shall be retained in a permanent file, to be opened only for purposes of sentencing in the case of an offense under RSA 265-A:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in any case in which a person is arrested for and charged with the offense of driving or attempting to drive a vehicle on any way or driving, operating, attempting to operate, or being in actual physical control of an OHRV or operating or attempting to operate a boat while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more and that charge is reduced from a second or subsequent offense to a first offense or in which the original charge is reduced to or in any manner substituted with another charge or a nolle prosequi entered in exchange for an agreement to plead guilty or nolo contendere to another charge, the prosecutor shall submit to the attorney general a written report describing such agreement.  All such written reports shall be submitted to the attorney general on a monthly basis.  The report shall contain such information as the attorney general shall prescribe;  provided, however, that the attorney general shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 541-A in prescribing such information.  The report required by this paragraph shall be a public record and shall be available for public inspection as provided in RSA 91-A:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if a person is arrested for driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle upon any way or driving, operating, attempting to operate, or being in actual physical control of an OHRV or operating or attempting to operate a boat while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, no prosecutor shall enter into any agreement with such person or such person's attorney if such agreement would result in a charge that removed the case from consideration under any provision of RSA 259-RSA 266.  The provisions of this paragraph, however, shall not prevent the bringing of any charge under RSA 630:2 or RSA 630:3.
