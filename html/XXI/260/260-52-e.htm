I. Eligible nonprofit corporations whose vehicles are registered in accordance with RSA 261:92 shall be entitled to a refund of any tolls paid by them to the extent that their vehicles are being used exclusively for the transportation of elderly or disabled persons by virtue of a contract with the department of transportation.  No eligible nonprofit corporation shall be entitled to a refund for an amount less than $10, and no payment of any refund shall be made to any person other than the eligible nonprofit corporation.  The entitlement to a refund shall not include a refund on any penalties or interest paid.  The application for a refund filed by an eligible nonprofit corporation shall be accompanied by such documentary evidence as the commissioner may require.
