&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 594:10 and RSA 594:14, a summons may be served on the owner or lessee of any truck, tractor, or semi-trailer operated in violation of the size, weight, equipment, or commercial vehicle rules in this title by delivering said summons in hand to any person driving said vehicle.  The driving of such vehicle with the express or implied consent of such owner or user shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such owner or user of the driver to be his true and lawful agent upon whom may be served such summons in any action against him arising out of a violation of this title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a corporation or other legal entity, after being duly served with process, fails to appear before a court of competent jurisdiction and to answer to an indictment or complaint brought against it under this title, its default shall be recorded, the charges in the indictment or complaint taken to be true, and judgment rendered accordingly.  Upon the rendering of such judgment, the court may issue a warrant of distress to compel payment of the penalty prescribed by law.
