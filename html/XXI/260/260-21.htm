&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The identification card shall bear the name, address, date of birth, blood type (optional), veteran's status for the purposes of identification for receiving benefits and services under New Hampshire law (optional), picture and signature of the applicant, and in the case of a card issued pursuant to RSA 260:21, I(c), said card shall bear the notation "Golden Granite State Discount Card.''

If the director has adopted rules under RSA 263:10, II with respect to on-line renewal of licenses, the director shall provide the same on-line option for identification cards, provided that the applicant is eligible for identification card renewal and has a computerized image on file with the division.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) The fee for such card shall be $10 and is not refundable, except that no fee shall be charged to any person who, for reason of health or age, turns in his or her driver's license before the expiration date of such license.  For purposes of this section, reasons of age shall be deemed to apply only to those persons over age 65.  A person who requires a photo identification card only for voter identification purposes may obtain a voucher in the form provided for in subparagraph (b) from his or her town or city clerk or the secretary of state exempting the voter from the identification card fee.  Upon presentation of the voucher to the division, the actual costs of issuing the card shall be paid by the secretary of state from the election fund established under RSA 5:6-d.  An identification card paid for by the secretary of state shall be valid for voter identification purposes only, and the card, which shall be known as a voter identification card, shall be marked "for voter identification only.''
