&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 260:6-b Point System for Automobile Dealer and Inspection Station Violations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director of motor vehicles may adopt rules pursuant to RSA 260:5 to establish 2 different uniform point systems for separately identifying automobile dealers and inspection stations which have violated the provisions of this title or rules adopted under this title.  The rules shall include a designated level of point accumulation which so identifies automobile dealers and inspection stations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The director may assess points for violations of this title or rules adopted pursuant to this title which have been found by a court of law or a hearing officer to have been violated.  Notice of the assessment of points shall be given in accordance with the rules adopted by the director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of a conviction or finding against a dealer or inspection station of 2 or more violations committed on a single occasion, such dealer or inspection station shall be assessed points for one offense only, under each separate point system if the same entity holds both a dealer's registration, license, or privileges, and inspection station privileges.  If the offenses have different point values, the dealer or inspection station shall be assessed for the offense having the greater point value.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The director may suspend or revoke the dealer's registration, license, or privileges, or in the case of an inspection station the inspection station privileges, in accordance with the rules adopted under this section.  The rules shall provide a mechanism for reduction of points for a dealer or inspection station that has completed a training course approved by the director.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The director may distinguish between larger and smaller dealers and inspection stations in establishing the point system.  For the purposes of the point system established under this section, an inspection station may not be liable for violations committed by an individual mechanic if the mechanic deliberately commits an action that is contrary to the law, the rules of the department, or the policies and procedures of the station.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Both point systems authorized under this section shall only count points for violations committed within the 3 most recent calendar years and shall only count violations that are committed on or after the effective date of the rules adopted under this section.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) If a distributor fails to maintain an active bond, as required by RSA 260:37, or at any time files a false monthly report, or willfully fails, neglects, or refuses to file the monthly report, or to pay the full amount of the road toll as required by this subdivision, the commissioner or his or her designee, after 10 days' written notice by certified mail directed to the last known address appearing on the files of the department:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Shall revoke or suspend the distributor's license, effective as of the date of the written notice;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Shall fix a time and place at the department's bureau of hearings, within 10 days of the written notice, where the licensee may appear and show cause why such license should be reinstated.  The license shall remain revoked or suspended until a hearing is conducted and a decision is rendered by the hearings examiner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The written notice shall be presumed to have been served, upon return of the certified receipt signed by the licensee, or 3 days after mailing to the last known address on record of the licensee, whichever comes first.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any distributor whose license remains suspended or revoked by the commissioner after a hearing may, within 30 days from the date of such decision, appeal to the superior court of Merrimack county.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of a written request from any distributor to cancel the license issued to the distributor, the commissioner shall have the power to cancel the license effective 60 days from the date of the receipt of the written request.  No license shall be cancelled unless the distributor shall, prior to the date of the cancellation, have paid all road tolls payable, together with all penalties and interest accruing under the provisions of this subdivision and until the distributor shall have surrendered to the commissioner its license certificate.  If, upon investigation, the department shall find that any person to whom a license has been issued is no longer engaged in the sale of motor fuel as a distributor, and has not been so engaged for a period of 6 months, the commissioner shall have the power to cancel such license by giving the person 60 days' notice of cancellation mailed to the last known address of the person, in which event the license certificate issued to the person shall be surrendered to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event that the license of any distributor shall be cancelled by the commissioner as provided, in this section and in the further event that the distributor shall have paid all road tolls due, together with all penalties and interest accruing under any of the provisions of this subdivision, the commissioner shall cancel and surrender the bond, cash, or securities filed by the distributor.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The fuel was used in any other way than generating power in an internal combustion engine while traveling on the ways, except that no refunds on motor fuel shall be paid on motor fuel used while idling a registered motor vehicle.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, "idling time'' shall mean when a motor vehicle is stationary with the engine operating at less than 1,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) without the power take-off unit engaged, and with the transmission in the neutral or park positions.  "Power take-off unit'' shall mean a supplementary mechanism enabling the engine power to be used to operate non-automotive apparatus.
<br>

(b) Road tolls paid by the state of New Hampshire, its agencies, or any city, town, county, school district, or village district which uses the motor fuel in its own vehicles;  provided, however, that no person, except an organized club of OHRVs or an organized club of snowmobiles, shall be entitled to a refund for an amount less than $10.  The right to receive any refund under this section shall not be assignable and any assignment thereof shall be void.  Provided, however, members of an organized club for OHRV or an organized club of snowmobile users may assign individual rights to a refund under this section to their respective clubs for the expansion and maintenance of club trails.  With the exception of refunds made to OHRV or snowmobile clubs, no payment of any refund shall be made to any person other than the original person entitled to it and using motor fuel as set forth in this paragraph;  and provided further, the OHRV or snowmobile of the user shall be registered for OHRV or snowmobile use in New Hampshire to be eligible for the road toll refund under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who shall be entitled to a refund of the road toll paid shall be reimbursed the amount of the road toll paid subject to the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (2), all applications for refunds shall be made subject to prosecution for unsworn falsification pursuant to RSA 641:3 and shall be filed with the department:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Annually, no later than April 15 following the end of the calendar year, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) If, at the close of any quarter of the calendar year at least $750 is payable in aggregate under these provisions to such person with respect to fuel used during the calendar year, an application may be filed under this subparagraph no later than the close of the subsequent quarter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) These filing deadlines may be waived by the commissioner for just cause for agencies of political subdivisions within the state.  The waiver shall not be granted to any such agency more often than once in 3 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) All applications for refunds for fuel used for off highway recreational vehicles, snowmobiles, and boats shall be made subject to prosecution for unsworn falsification pursuant to RSA 641:3 and shall be filed with the department annually no later than April 15 of the year following the calendar year the motor fuel was purchased by the user.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The application shall be in a form as the department shall prescribe and shall contain such information as required to give the commissioner a full and complete basis for determining the validity of the claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The application shall be accompanied by an invoice showing the purchase, together with evidence of payment of the invoice satisfactory to the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The provisions of RSA 260:44, relative to inspection of records and hearings, shall apply to this subparagraph if so determined by the commissioner or the commissioners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The application form shall permit the applicant to authorize payment of all or a portion of the refund to the navigation safety fund established under RSA 270-E:6-a or to the lake restoration and preservation fund, established in RSA 487:25, to be allocated to the control and prevention of exotic aquatic species.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the above conditions have been fully complied with and when, after investigation, the commissioner is satisfied that the claim is valid, the commissioner shall determine the amount of the refund due on the application, and shall certify the amount and the name of the person entitled to the refund to the state treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any diplomatic or consular personnel certified by the United States Department of State as eligible for an exemption from taxes on motor fuel on the basis of reciprocity shall be entitled to apply for a refund as provided in this section, provided, however, that the personnel shall be entitled to a refund regardless of whether or not it is less than $10.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Motorsport facilities which sell or dispense automotive racing fuel for off-highway activities including snowmobile use shall be entitled to apply for a refund under this section.  Refunds shall only be granted to such facilities for fuels which are specifically designed for automotive racing and which have an octane rating of 105 or higher.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Where any road toll or other fees or charges imposed under this subdivision or any fees or charges imposed under the fuel tax agreement authorized by RSA 260:65-b or any fees or charges imposed under the international registration plan in RSA 260:75 are not paid and are due as prescribed by this subdivision or by RSA 260:65-b or RSA 260:75, the amount including interest, together with the costs that may accrue in addition thereto, shall become a lien in favor of the state of New Hampshire upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, including vehicles belonging to any person upon whom said tolls, fees, or charges are imposed, as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The lien shall arise at the time the tolls, fees, or charges are due pursuant to this subdivision or RSA 260:65-b or RSA 260:75 and shall continue until the liability for the sum, together with interest and costs, is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The lien shall be valid against any subsequent mortgagee, pledgee, installment loan creditor, purchaser, or judgment creditor when notice of the lien and the sum due has been filed by the road toll administration as provided in this section.  In the case of any prior mortgage on real or personal property so written as to secure present debt and also future advances by the mortgagee to the mortgagor, the lien provided for in this section, when notice thereof has been filed in the proper office, shall be subject to such prior mortgage unless the road toll administration also notifies the mortgagee of the recording of such lien in writing, in which case any indebtedness thereafter created from mortgagor to mortgagee shall be junior to the lien provided for in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notice of the lien shall be provided to the person upon whom the road toll or fees are imposed by certified mail sent to the person's last known residence or principal place of business as shown on the records of the department.  The notice shall advise the person of the right to seek an administrative hearing pursuant to RSA 260:44 relative to the imposition of road tolls or fees, or fees and charges under the fuel tax agreement, or fees and charges under the international registration plan, within 14 days of the receipt of the notice.  Upon expiration of 14 days if no hearing is requested or after a hearing if a hearing is requested, the commissioner shall issue a decision determining the amount of road tolls or fees, or fees and charges under the fuel tax agreement, or fees and charges under the international registration plan, plus interest and costs due to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After rendering a decision the commissioner shall file notice of the lien as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of personal property subject to the lien, the notice shall be filed with the secretary of state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of real property subject to the lien, notice shall be filed in the registry of deeds for the county wherein such property is situated;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the case of vehicles subject to the lien, notice shall be recorded on the registration and title records of the department pertaining to said vehicles.  In the case of vehicles registered in another state or a Canadian province, a copy of the lien shall also be filed with the motor vehicle administrator in the state or province in which the vehicle is registered.  Law enforcement agents of the department, upon encountering such a vehicle being operated on the ways of the state, may temporarily seize such vehicle for sufficient time to permit the department to institute appropriate civil action for the forfeiture and sale of said vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the amount determined by the commissioner is not paid within 30 days or the decision of the commissioner is not appealed pursuant to RSA 260:51, the department shall have the authority to seize any real or personal property including vehicles subject to the above lien and to foreclosure upon the lien as provided in RSA 260:65.
<br>

<center><h3>Section 260:75</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 260:75 International Registration Plan. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The IRP referred to in this subdivision shall take substantially the following form:
<center>
<p>
<b>Article I. Purpose and Principle</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. This reciprocal agreement shall be known as the International Registration Plan and referred to as the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. The fundamental principal of the plan is to promote and encourage the fullest possible use of the highway system by authorizing the proportional registration of apportionable fleets of vehicles, and the recognition by each member jurisdiction of the registration of vehicles apportioned by other member jurisdictions thus contributing to the economic and social development and growth of the jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
C. It is the purpose of the plan to implement the concept of one registration plate for one vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
D. The intent of the plan is to encourage member jurisdictions to grant exemptions from the payment of non-apportionable fees by registrants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
E. It is the purpose of the plan to provide a system through which member jurisdictions grant reciprocity to apportioned proportionally registered fleets of vehicles, and to provide for the continuance of reciprocity granted to those vehicles that are not eligible for apportioned registration under the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
F. The plan preempts any agreement, arrangement, or understanding of any kind between any 2 or more member jurisdictions concerning matters within the plan.  The plan shall not, however, affect any agreement, arrangement, or understanding between a member jurisdiction and a jurisdiction that is not a member jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
G. A registrant's payment to the base jurisdiction of apportionable fees due under the plan to all member jurisdictions discharges the registrant's responsibility for payment of apportionable fees to individual member jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
H. This plan applies only to apportionable fees.  Nothing in this plan shall be construed to waive any fees or taxes authorized by the laws of any member jurisdiction in connection with the ownership or operation of vehicles.
<center>
<p>
<b>Article II. Definitions</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. "Allocation'' means a system of registering a fleet that operates in more than one member jurisdiction under which the vehicles are fully registered in individual member jurisdictions in proportion to a measure of the presence or travel of the fleet in each one, and under which the vehicles so registered are granted reciprocity in all the member jurisdictions in which any of the vehicles of the fleet is registered.
<br>

<b>Article III. Fees</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. The registration fee for apportionable vehicles shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. The following method is to be used to calculate the apportionment percentage with respect to a fleet for each member jurisdiction in which apportioned registration is sought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For a member jurisdiction in which the fleet (1) accrued distance during the reporting period, or (2) has never been apportioned and did not accrue distance during the reporting period:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) determine the total actual distance operated during the reporting period in all member jurisdictions where fleet vehicles were apportioned during the reporting period and where the registrant desires to renew apportioned registration;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) estimate the total distance to be operated by the fleet during the registration year in all member jurisdictions where fleet vehicles were neither previously apportioned nor accrued actual distance during the reporting period, but in which the registrant desires apportioned registration;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) add the amount determined in subparagraph (i) to the amount determined in subparagraph (ii).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The apportionment percentage for each such member jurisdiction is the distance attributed to that member jurisdiction divided by the amount determined in subparagraph (iii) of this subparagraph (calculated to 6 decimal places and rounded to 5 decimal places), times 100.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For a member jurisdiction in which the fleet did not accrue distance during the reporting period but in which it has previously been apportioned:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) estimate the total distance to be operated during the registration year in all such member jurisdictions;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) add this amount to the amount determined in subparagraph (iii) of subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The apportionment percentage for each member jurisdiction is the estimated distance attributed to that member jurisdiction divided by the amount determined in subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph (calculated to 6 decimal places and rounded to 5 decimal places), times 100.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For purposes of subparagraph (a), a fleet shall be considered never to have been apportioned in a member jurisdiction if the registrant has neither (i) owned or leased apportioned vehicles during the 18 months prior to the date of its application for apportioned registration, nor (ii) accrued actual distance by operating apportioned vehicles in any member jurisdiction during the reporting period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a fleet was apportioned in a member jurisdiction for no more than the last 90 calendar days of the reporting period, the fleet's apportionment percentage for that member jurisdiction may, at the option of the registrant, be calculated under subparagraph (a) if, with respect to that member jurisdiction, the fleet otherwise meets the qualifications of subparagraphs (a) and (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Additional Jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A registrant may, after the beginning of the registration year, add one or more member jurisdictions to those in which its fleet is apportioned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the fleet accrued actual distance in an added member jurisdiction during the reporting period, this amount must be used in calculating the apportioned fee for the member jurisdiction, and an estimate of distance may not be used.  If the fleet did not accrue actual distance during the reporting period in the member jurisdiction being added, an estimate representing annual distance to be traveled in the member jurisdiction shall be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The apportionment percentage for a member jurisdiction to be added shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) the actual distance or estimate determined for the member jurisdiction in subparagraph (b) divided by,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) the sum of:  the denominator determined under subparagraph 1 for the apportionment percentages of the registrant at the time of its initial application for apportioned registration for the registration year, plus the actual distance or estimate determined for the member jurisdiction in subparagraph (b), plus the sum of the actual distance or estimates for any other member jurisdiction or member jurisdictions added to its registration by the registrant since the beginning of the registration year,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) with the quotient carried to 6 and rounded to 5 decimal places and multiplied by 100.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The apportioned fee for the added member jurisdiction shall then be calculated according to Section 400 of the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In no event shall the calculation of an apportioned fee for a member jurisdiction added to a registration during the registration year alter the apportionment percentages previously determined for any other member jurisdiction for the year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. No member jurisdiction shall require any minimum registration fee for an apportionable vehicle.  A base jurisdiction may by law require payment of additional fees for each apportioned vehicle, such as for issuing credentials or filing an application for apportioned registration.
<center>
<p>
<b>Article IV. Application for Proportional Registration</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. 1. An applicant for proportional registration shall file a uniform application with the commissioner of the base jurisdiction in lieu of registration under any other registration statute of any member jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. (a) An applicant may elect as its base jurisdiction any member jurisdiction (i) where the applicant has an established place of business, (ii) where the fleet the applicant seeks to register under the plan accrues distance, and (iii) where operational records of the fleet are maintained or can be made available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An applicant that does not have an established place of business in any jurisdiction may designate as a base jurisdiction any member jurisdiction (i) where the applicant can demonstrate residence, (ii) where the fleet the applicant seeks to register under the plan accrues distance, and (iii) where operational records of the fleet are maintained or can be made available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To establish residence in a member jurisdiction, an applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the member jurisdiction at least 3 of the following:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) if the applicant is a corporation, that it is incorporated or registered to conduct business as a foreign corporation in that jurisdiction,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) if the applicant is a corporation, that the principal owner is a resident of that jurisdiction,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) that the applicant's federal income tax returns have been filed from an address in that jurisdiction,

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(viii) that the applicant has a vehicle titled in that jurisdiction in its name, or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ix) that other factors clearly evidence the applicant's legal residence in that jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. Applications for proportional registrations shall be filed on a date as determined by the base jurisdiction.  Every application for proportional registration shall, at the time and in the manner required by the commissioner, be supported by the payment of the registration fees in the amount determined in Article III, provided, however, the commissioner may, by rule, postpone payment of fees until after the commissioner has computed the fees due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
C. 1. The application shall contain the number of power units with such vehicle description as may be required by the jurisdictions concerned and a uniform distance schedule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. The base jurisdiction, after receiving its proportionate fees, shall supply the necessary identification plates and prepare cab cards, listing on the front of the cab cards the jurisdictions where the vehicles are proportionately registered, the weight for which registered, and other necessary information in each of the jurisdictions.  The base jurisdiction may, in its discretion, withhold issuing plates and cards until it has received evidence of payment due other member jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
5. The base jurisdiction shall cooperate with other declared jurisdictions in connection with applications and fees paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
D.

A registration card shall be issued, which should list the jurisdictions in which the vehicle has been apportioned, the weight and classification of fee for which registered according to the applications and payments furnished by the applicant.  Such registration card shall be carried in or upon the vehicle for which it has been issued at all times.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. Vehicles registered as provided in paragraph A of this Article shall be deemed fully registered in all jurisdictions where proportionately registered for any type of movement or operation provided the registrant has proper authority from the appropriate regulatory agency or is exempt from regulation by the regulatory agency.

If a vehicle is withdrawn from a registration year, the amount of the apportionable fee for the vehicle for the remainder of the registration year shall be available for transfer to the registration of a replacement vehicle in the fleet or subject to the law of each member jurisdiction, may be credited or refunded to the registrant.  If a vehicle is permanently withdrawn from a proportionally registered fleet because it has been destroyed, sold, or otherwise completely removed from the service of the registrant, the unused portion of the fees paid with respect to such vehicle, where permitted by statute, shall be refunded by each jurisdiction or be applied against liability of such registrant for subsequent additions to such fleet during such registration year or for additional fees upon audit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. If the registrant is replacing a vehicle for one withdrawn from the fleet and such vehicle is of the same weight category as that replaced, the registrant shall file a supplemental application with the base jurisdiction.  The base jurisdiction shall, in accordance with provisions in Article VI.B, issue a new cab card and transfer the identification plates to the new vehicle.  When a replaced vehicle is of greater weight or requires a larger registration fee, the registrant shall file the re-registration with the base jurisdiction in a manner set forth in Article VI for the registration of additional fleet vehicles.

<p>
<b>Article VIII. New Operations</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Initial applications for proportional registrations shall state the distance data in all jurisdictions for the reporting period with respect to such vehicle or vehicles.  If no operations were conducted with such vehicle or vehicles during the reporting year, the application shall contain a full statement of the proposed method of operation and estimates of annual distance in each of the jurisdictions.  The registrant shall determine the in-jurisdiction and total distance to be used in computing the proportional registration fee for the vehicle or vehicles.  The base jurisdiction commissioner may adjust the estimate in the application if the base jurisdiction commissioner is not satisfied with its correctness.

<p>
<b>Article IX. Registration of Owner-Operator Vehicles</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>

A. Proportional registration for owner-operators who lease their vehicles to motor carriers on a long term basis shall be accomplished as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. The identification plates and cab cards shall be the property of the lessee.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. Vehicles of owner-operators that are not proportionally registered or not fully registered in a jurisdiction having a separate reciprocity agreement with the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is being operated shall be subject to the trip permit requirement as set forth in Article XII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<b>Article X. Trip Leasing</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The lessee shall be the person using and operating the equipment by the lease agreement.  The leased vehicle must bear proportional credentials and be operated only in the jurisdictions to which fees have been paid or a trip permit will be required.  The service representative in Article IV.D shall also have the same responsibility for qualifying his or her vehicles.

</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

1. Such vehicles are part of a rental fleet which are identifiable as being part of such fleet;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Rental passenger cars.  Divide the gross revenue received in the preceding year for use of such rental vehicles arising from passenger car rental transactions occurring in the jurisdiction by the total gross revenue received in the preceding year for the use of such rental vehicles arising from passenger car rental transactions occurring in all jurisdictions in which such vehicles were operated.  The resulting percentage shall be applied to the total number of passenger cars in the fleet and that figure shall be the number of rental passenger cars that shall be fully registered in a jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The owner of rental utility trailers of gross vehicle weight 6,000 pounds (2,751.554 kilograms) or less shall register in each member jurisdiction a number of trailers equal to the average number of trailers rented in or through the member jurisdiction during the preceding year.  For this purpose, a trailer shall be considered to be rented in or through the member jurisdiction in which the trailer first comes into possession of the lessee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<p>
<b>Article XII. Trip Permit Registration</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. Trip permit registration may be issued for any vehicle or combination of vehicles which could be lawfully operated in the jurisdiction if full registration or proportional registration were obtained.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. 1. The base jurisdiction shall require a registrant to preserve all operational records on which the registrant's application for apportioned registration is based for a period of 3 years following the close of the registration year to which the application pertains and to make these records available for examination by the base jurisdiction at its request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Records may be kept on microfilm, microfiche, or other computerized or condensed record storage system acceptable to the base jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. The base jurisdiction may impose an assessment on a registrant that fails to maintain records in accordance with the APM or that fails to provide records within 30 calendar days of the issuance of a written request by the base jurisdiction.  Such an assessment shall be based on the base jurisdiction's estimate of the registrant's true liability as determined from evidence furnished by the registrant or available to the base jurisdiction from its own or other sources.
<center>
<p>
<b>Article XIV. Audits</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. 1. The base jurisdiction shall audit the registrants to which it has issued apportioned registration.  The purpose of such an audit shall be to access the accuracy of the distances reported in a registrant's application for apportioned registration and, where inaccuracies are found, to adjust the registrant's fees accordingly.  Each member jurisdiction shall conduct a number of audits equivalent to an average of 3 percent per year of the number of fleets whose registration it renews annually under the plan, as required to be reported by the member jurisdiction in the annual report filed pursuant to the plan.  Upon the peer review of a member jurisdiction, this requirement shall be deemed to have been met if, during the interval since the previous peer review of the member jurisdiction, it has audited an average of 3 percent of the number of renewed fleets.  For purposes of this requirement, the examination of one fleet for one registration year shall be deemed to be one audit.  Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude a member jurisdiction from conducting more audits than it is required to under this paragraph, or from auditing a registrant more than once during the interval between peer reviews.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. If a registrant's operational records are not provided in its base jurisdiction and the base jurisdiction sends auditors beyond its borders to conduct the audit, the base jurisdiction may require the registrant to reimburse the base jurisdiction for the per diem and travel expenses that the auditors incur in conducting the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. Upon completion of any such audit, the commissioner shall notify all member jurisdictions in which the registrant was proportionally registered of the accuracy of the records of such registrant.  If the registrant shall have miscalculated the fees due any jurisdiction in which his or her vehicles were proportionally registered, such information shall be furnished to the jurisdictions for adjustment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
C. 1. The base jurisdiction shall provide a registrant 30 calendar days from the date the registrant is notified of the findings of an audit or a reexamination to file a written appeal of the audit or reexamination with the base jurisdiction.  Such an appeal shall proceed in accordance with the administrative and appellate procedures of the base jurisdiction.  In the conduct of an appeal, the base jurisdiction shall represent affected member jurisdictions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Upon the conclusion of the appeal process, the base jurisdiction shall notify all affected member jurisdictions of the results.  If one or more findings of the audit remain unresolved after these procedures have been exhausted, the registrant may challenge disputed audit findings that remain by filing a dispute.
<center>
<p>
<b>Article XV. Assessment Claims Under Audit</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. Upon the conclusion of the audit of a registrant, the base jurisdiction shall assess the registrant for any deficiency found to be due to any member jurisdiction.  Unless an extension is granted by the registrant, no assessment for deficiency or any refund may be made for any period for which the registrant is not required to maintain records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. An assessment, whether for a deficiency found on audit, for a refund or credit of a fee paid, or for any other amount, including interest and auditor's expenses assessed under Article XIV.A.2, shall be made in accordance with the law of the member jurisdiction affected.

(a) a single registration plate and a single registration cab card shall be issued for each apportionable vehicle of a registrant's fleet, and only by the registrant's base jurisdiction;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) a fleet registered under the plan shall be authorized to make both interjurisdictional and intrajurisdictional movements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
F. There shall be an implementation period of 120 calendar days following the date on which a jurisdiction becomes a member jurisdiction.  The purpose of this implementation period is to allow registrants to come into compliance with the plan.  Any preexisting repository agreements affecting the new member jurisdiction shall remain in effect throughout the implementation period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
G. Each member jurisdiction shall administer the plan in such a way that no other member jurisdiction is unfairly disadvantaged and with a reasonable degree of care and prudence toward the interests of the other member jurisdictions.  The base jurisdiction shall cooperate with other member jurisdictions in connection with applications and the collection of apportionable fees.  Each member jurisdiction shall exercise particular care with respect to the administration of any aspect of the plan that affects the apportionable fees of other member jurisdictions.  Each member jurisdiction shall expend reasonable resources to enforce the provisions of the plan, and to be vigilant against fraud and sham, particularly in the areas of registrant basing and estimates of distance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
H. Each member jurisdiction shall administer the plan in a way consistent with the fundamental purpose of the plan.

</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. The plan may be amended upon the affirmative vote of  3/4 of the number of member jurisdictions that have cast a ballot.
