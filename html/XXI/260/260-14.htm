<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Person'' means an individual, organization or entity, but shall not include this state or an agency thereof. "Person'' shall include the personal representative of any person injured or killed in the motor vehicle accident, including the person's conservator, executor, administrator, or next of kin as defined in RSA 259:66-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Personal information'' means information in motor vehicle records that identifies a person, including a person's photograph or computerized image, social security number, driver identification number, name, address (but not the 5-digit zip code), telephone number, and medical or disability information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) "Legitimate business'' means a business which is registered in New Hampshire and which receives compensation in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety or theft, motor vehicle emissions, and motor vehicle market research activities, including survey research.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Proper motor vehicle records shall be kept by the department at its office.  Notwithstanding RSA 91-A or any other provision of law to the contrary, except as otherwise provided in this section, such records shall not be public records or open to the inspection of any person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Copies of such records, duly attested and certified by the director, or designee, shall be as competent evidence in any court within this state as the original record or document would be if produced by such person as the legal custodian.  A hearings examiner shall be considered a legal custodian of motor vehicle records for the purpose of testifying at a trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The accident report, the technical accident reconstruction report, any repair estimate, or any similar document that constitutes a motor vehicle record that is created or received as a result of any accident or collision involving a vehicle owned or leased by the state, a county, a city, a town, or a local public entity shall be a governmental record subject to inspection and disclosure in accordance with RSA 91-A except when inspection or disclosure would risk exposure of undercover law enforcement activity.  Any report of a violation of this title by an employee or official of a county, a city, a town, or a local public entity while engaged in official business in a vehicle owned or leased by the state, a county, a city, a town, or a local public entity shall be a governmental record subject to inspection and disclosure in accordance with RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Motor vehicle records may be made available pursuant to a court order or in response to a request from a state, a political subdivision of a state, the federal government, or a law enforcement agency for use in official business.  The request shall be on a case-by-case basis.  Any records received pursuant to this paragraph shall not be further transferred or otherwise made available to any other person or listed entity not authorized under this paragraph.  Any records received pursuant to this paragraph shall not be used, further transferred, or otherwise made available to any other person or entity for the purpose of creating or enhancing a federal identification database.

Any records received under this paragraph shall not be used for purposes other than for toll collection and shall not be further transferred or otherwise made available to any other person or entity that is not a contracted agent of the department of transportation for toll collection.  The nongovernmental contracted agent of the department of transportation for toll collection is prohibited from releasing the motor vehicle records to a third party or from using the records for the collection of debts outside the toll collection system.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 260:14, XIV, the department of transportation shall be responsible for ensuring its own and its contracted agent's compliance with this section, and the commissioner, upon determining that the department of transportation or its contracted agent has violated any provisions of this section may issue a written order prohibiting the department of transportation and its contracted agent from receiving motor vehicle records commencing 10 days following the issuance of the order and lasting for no longer than 5 years, unless the commissioner is satisfied that procedures are in place and will be enforced to ensure compliance with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-b. A corporation that is operating under an active DD Form 441 Department of Defense Security Agreement and has a facility located within the state may request that the commissioner grant a waiver to the corporation that would permit it to obtain the name and address of the owner of any motor vehicle that is on or adjacent to the corporation's property within the state of New Hampshire.  The corporation shall only use information received under this paragraph for security purposes.  The commissioner may grant or renew the waiver for any period up to one year.  During the period when the waiver is valid, the police department of jurisdiction shall, upon request, provide to the corporation's security operations center supervisor, or equivalent person, the name and address of the owner of any motor vehicle on or adjacent to the corporation's property within the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-c. The name and last known address of the owner of a vehicle used in violation of a toll collection system and the physical characteristics of such vehicle may be made available to another state, or to a statutory or nongovernmental contracted agent of such other state for the collection of a toll in such other state as identified by a toll collection system, as defined by RSA 236:31, I(i), whether the vehicle was used in violation of an electronic toll collection system or the vehicle was identified by a toll collection monitoring system when there is no cash option in the toll lanes.  Any records received under this paragraph shall not be used for purposes other than for toll collection and shall not be further transferred or otherwise made available to a person or entity that is not a statutory or contracted agent of such other state for toll collection.  The other state or statutory or nongovernmental contracted agent of such other state is prohibited from releasing the motor vehicle records to a third party or from using the records for the collection of debts outside the toll collection system.  Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 260:14, XIV, such other state shall be responsible for ensuring its own and its statutory or contracted agent's compliance with this section, and the commissioner, upon determining that such other state or its statutory or contracted agent has violated any provisions of this section may issue a written order prohibiting such other state and its statutory or contracted agent from receiving motor vehicle records commencing 10 business days following the issuance of the order and lasting no longer than 5 years, unless the commissioner is satisfied that procedures are in place and will be enforced to ensure compliance with this chapter.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
