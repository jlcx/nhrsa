&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 265:91-d Review. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Within 10 days following the examiner's ruling, a person whose license has been suspended or revoked, or the law enforcement officer, may petition the director for a review of the ruling.  The filing of the petition shall not stay a suspension or revocation of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive if imposed, or the restoration of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive.  The review shall determine whether the ruling is erroneous as a matter of law or cannot be sustained by the facts as presented at the hearing.  After a review of the ruling, the director shall issue within 10 days a finding either affirming the ruling or granting a new hearing.  Any grant of a new hearing shall be accompanied by a written explanation setting forth the specific error of law or the reason why the ruling cannot be sustained by the facts.
