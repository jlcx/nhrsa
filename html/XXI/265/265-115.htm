<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No person shall smoke, carry matches or any other flame producing device or carry any unauthorized firearms or loaded cartridges while in or near a vehicle transporting explosive materials, or drive, load or unload such vehicle in a careless or reckless manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Vehicles used for transporting explosive materials shall be strong enough to carry the load without difficulty or exceeding the manufacturer's recommended gross vehicle weight and be in good mechanical condition.  If vehicles do not have a closed body, the body shall be covered with a flame retardant and moisture proof tarpaulin or other effective protection against moisture and sparks.  All vehicles used for the transportation of explosive materials shall have tight floors and any exposed spark producing metal on the inside of the body shall be covered with wood or other nonsparking material to prevent contact with packages of explosives.  Packages of explosive materials shall not be loaded above the sides of an open body vehicle.  Explosive materials shall not be transported in trailers.

This attendant shall have been made aware of the class of the explosive material in the vehicle and of its inherent dangers by the carrier and shall have been instructed in the measures and procedures to be followed in order to protect the public from those dangers.  He shall have been made familiar with the vehicle he is assigned to attend, and shall be trained, supplied with the necessary means, and authorized to move the vehicle when required.  For the purpose of this paragraph, a vehicle shall be deemed to be attended only when the driver or other attendant is physically on or in the vehicle or has the vehicle within his range of vision and can reach it quickly without any kind of interference.  Attended also means that the driver or attendant is awake, alert and not engaged in other duties or activities which may divert his attention from the vehicle, except for necessary communication with public officers, or representatives of the carrier, shipper or consignee, or except for necessary absence from the vehicle to obtain food or to provide for his physical comfort.
