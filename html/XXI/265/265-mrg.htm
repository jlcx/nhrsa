&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 265:10 Traffic Control Signal Legend. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively, one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Green Indication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn.  But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time.  Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in RSA 265:11, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Steady Yellow Indication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in RSA 265:11, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Steady Red Indication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraphs III, (b) and (f).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a sign is in place permitting a turn, traffic, except pedestrians, facing a steady circular red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make the turn indicated by the sign after stopping, as required in subparagraph III(a).  Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in RSA 265:11, pedestrians facing a steady circular red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Traffic, except pedestrians, facing a steady red arrow indication may not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by such arrow, unless entering the intersection to make such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to make the movement indicated by such arrow is shown, except as provided in subparagraph III(f).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal, pedestrians facing a steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Except when the authority having jurisdiction over the intersection prohibits such a turn and a sign located at the intersection so indicates, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone or a steady red arrow indication shall stop as required in this section and may after making such stop make a right turn if such right turn is lawful at that intersection.  Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Signal not at an Intersection.  In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Any person whose license is suspended or revoked under this subdivision or RSA 263:96 may request either an administrative review or a hearing.  The request shall be in writing and shall state the grounds upon which the person seeks to have the order of suspension or revocation rescinded, which grounds shall be limited to those provided in paragraph II.  The filing of the request shall not stay the suspension or revocation.  A request for either administrative review or hearing received by the department after 30 days from the date the notice is issued shall be denied as untimely.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the request is for an administrative review, the request may be accompanied by any statement or other evidence which the person wants the department to consider.  Upon receiving the request the department shall review the order, the evidence upon which it is based, including whether the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, and any other information brought to the attention of the department, and shall determine whether sufficient cause exists to sustain the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the request is for a hearing, the request shall also indicate whether or not the person desires to have the law enforcement officer present.  The hearing shall be held within 20 days after the filing of the request unless the person requests a continuance.  A request for a continuance by the person shall not stay the order of suspension or revocation.  The hearing shall be recorded, and be conducted by the department's designated agent.  The hearing may be conducted upon a review of the law enforcement officer's report if there is no request to have the officer present.  If there is a request that the law enforcement officer be present at the hearing and the officer fails to appear without good cause shown, the case shall be dismissed and the order rescinded.  If the person requesting the hearing fails to appear without good cause shown, the right to a hearing shall be waived and the order sustained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The scope of the administrative review or hearing shall be limited to the issue of whether the person had been arrested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of either an administrative review or a hearing, the hearing examiner shall issue his or her recommendation on the order of suspension or revocation within 15 days of the request for administrative review or the hearing date.  The recommendation shall be in writing and a copy shall be provided to the parties.  The recommendation shall be final unless a review or appeal is filed under RSA 265:91-d or RSA 265:91-e.

The filing of the petition shall not stay a suspension or revocation of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive if imposed, or the restoration of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive.  The review shall determine whether the ruling is erroneous as a matter of law or cannot be sustained by the facts as presented at the hearing.  After a review of the ruling, the director shall issue within 10 days a finding either affirming the ruling or granting a new hearing.
