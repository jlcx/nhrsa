&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:12 Installment in Default. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In the event the judgment debtor fails to pay any installment as permitted by the order of the court, then upon notice of such default the director shall forthwith suspend the license and registration certificates and registration plates of the judgment debtor until such judgment is satisfied as provided in this chapter.  Provided, however, if the judgment creditor consents in writing, in such form as the department may prescribe, that the judgment debtor be allowed license and registration, the same may be allowed by the director, in his discretion, notwithstanding default in the payment of such judgment or of any installment thereof, for 6 months from the date of such consent and thereafter until such consent is revoked in writing, if the judgment debtor gives and thereafter maintains proof of his financial responsibility in the future.
