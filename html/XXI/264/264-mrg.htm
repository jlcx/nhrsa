&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:3 When Proof Required After Report of Accident. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After receipt of the report required by RSA 264:25, the director shall suspend the license and registration certificate and require the surrender of the registration plates, if any, of the driver, and shall suspend the registration certificates and require the surrender of the plates of the owner of the vehicle, trailer, or semi-trailer involved in the accident reported and shall suspend his license, if any, or driving privilege until such driver or owner or both shall have furnished sufficient security to satisfy any judgment or judgments for damages resulting from such accident as may be recovered against such owner or driver by or on behalf of the aggrieved person or his legal representative, and until such owner or driver or both shall give and thereafter maintain proof of financial responsibility in the future.  Notice of such suspension and of the requirement of such surrender shall be sent by the director to such driver and owner not less than 10 days prior to the effective date of such suspension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This section shall not apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To such owner or driver if such owner had in effect at the time of such accident with respect to such vehicle a motor vehicle liability policy or motor vehicle liability bond, as herein defined;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To such driver, if not the owner of such vehicle, if there was in effect at the time of such accident such a policy or bond with respect to his driving of vehicles not owned by him;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To such owner or driver if the liability of such owner or driver for the damages resulting from such accident is, in the judgment of the director, covered by any other form of insurance policy or bond, or proof of financial responsibility in accordance with RSA 264:20 and 21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Where erroneous information with respect to insurance coverage of the owner or driver of any such vehicle is furnished to the department, it shall take appropriate action as above provided after the receipt by it of correct information with respect to such coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Within 15 days after the receipt of notice of such accident from the department, the insurance carrier or surety company which issued such policy shall notify the department in such manner as it may require in case such policy was not in effect at the time of such accident.  If no such notification is received within such 15 days, the director may assume that such a policy was in effect at the time of the accident.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In case any such driver or owner has no license to drive a vehicle or no vehicle registered in his name in this state, he shall not be allowed a license or registration until he has complied with this chapter to the same extent as would be necessary if he had held a driver's license and a vehicle registration at the time of the accident.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No such policy shall be effective under this section unless issued by an insurance company or surety company authorized to do business in this state, except that such policy may be accepted from an insurance company or surety company not authorized to do business in this state if such company possesses capital and assets to the extent and of the quality required under the provisions of RSA 405:2 or 4, as determined by the insurance commissioner of this state and such company shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the director to accept service on its behalf of notice or process in any action involving such policy arising out of such accident;  provided, however, every such policy shall provide the same degree of security as required by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 264:5 or any determination previously made by the director under this section, the director, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that there is an unsatisfied judgment against any owner or driver required by RSA 264:25 to report an accident which judgment was rendered in an action for damages to property or for personal injuries arising out of said accident, shall, until said owner or driver or both shall have satisfied said judgment to the extent required by RSA 264:8, suspend the license and driving privilege and registration certificates and require the surrender of the registration plates, if any, of said driver and owner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:6 Limitation of Driving. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The provisions of RSA 264:3 shall not apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To the owner of a vehicle driven by one having obtained possession or control thereof without his express or implied consent;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To either the owner or driver of a vehicle involved in an accident when the director shall be satisfied that neither caused nor contributed to cause the accident, except that any such determination of satisfaction shall be reversed by the director should any court subsequently render judgment based upon said accident against said driver or owner or both, in which event the director shall forthwith suspend the license and registration certificate in accordance with the provisions of RSA 264:3;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To either the owner or driver of a vehicle involved in an accident that was caused by the criminal act of a third party, for which criminal act such other party has been convicted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing contained in RSA 264:14 shall be so construed as to deprive an insured person in litigating his claim against an uninsured person from a right of trial by jury.  If the form of policy authorized by RSA 264:14 does not contain an arbitration clause approved by the insurance commissioner, the insured may have the liability of the insurer determined by a trial of the issues by the superior court justice.  In the event of arbitration the insured shall not be required to advance costs, and at the conclusion of such arbitration the arbitration costs shall be divided equally between the insured and the insurer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:7 Suspensions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The suspension required in RSA 264:3 shall remain in effect, the vehicle in any manner involved in such accident shall not be registered in the name of the person whose license or registration was so suspended, and no other vehicle shall be registered in the name of such person nor shall any license be held by him until he has obtained a release or a judgment in his favor in an action at law to recover for damage to property or the death of or bodily injury to any person resulting from such accident or unless he shall have satisfied in the manner hereinafter provided any judgment rendered against him in such action, and gives and thereafter maintains proof of his financial responsibility.  If the department has received no written notice from the aggrieved or injured person or his legal representative that suit has been brought within 2 years from the date of the accident the department then may, subject to the other requirements of the law, issue to such person a new license to drive and new registration certificates and registration plates, provided he shall give and thereafter maintain proof of financial responsibility.  A discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve the judgment debtor from any of the requirements of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department may waive the requirements of filing proof of financial responsibility and certificates at any time after 3 years' duration from the date of accident involvement or conviction requiring such proof, provided the department has not received further record of conviction, accident involvement, forfeiture of bail, unsatisfied judgment or other evidence which would require the continuance of such furnishing of proof of financial responsibility and certificates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon receipt of notice or certification that the driving privilege or the privilege to have driven any vehicle registered to a resident of this state, or both, have been suspended or revoked in any other state, pursuant to a law providing for its suspension or revocation for failure to deposit security for the payment of judgments arising out of a vehicle accident, or failure to maintain proof of financial responsibility in the future;  under circumstances which would allow the director to suspend a nonresident's driving privilege had the accident or conviction occurred in this state, the director may suspend or revoke the license or registration or both of such resident.  Such suspension or revocation shall continue until such resident furnishes evidence of compliance with the law of such other state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This chapter shall apply to nonresidents.  If a nonresident has failed to furnish security or to give proof of his financial responsibility in the future as required hereunder, then he shall not drive any vehicle in this state nor shall any such vehicle owned by him be driven within this state by any person, and the director shall not issue to such nonresident any driver's license or register any such vehicle owned by such nonresident except in the same manner as required with respect to a resident of this state.  The driving by a nonresident, or with his express or implied consent if an owner, of a vehicle on a way of the state shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such nonresident of the director or his successor in office, to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful processes in any action against him, growing out of any accident in which said nonresident may be involved while so driving or so permitting to be driven a vehicle on such a way.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a nonresident's privilege of driving a motor vehicle or the privilege to have any vehicle registered to such individual driven in New Hampshire or both have been suspended under the provisions of this chapter, the department shall transmit a copy of the record of such action to the official in charge of the issuance of licenses and registrations in the state in which such nonresident resides, if the law of such state provides for action in relation thereto similar to that provided for in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a nonresident has been arrested for a serious traffic violation as defined in RSA 259:98-a, the director, upon receipt of a written or computer-generated request from a law enforcement agency, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Secure a copy of the nonresident's motor vehicle record from the state in which the nonresident resides;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enter the nonresident's motor vehicle record into the department's recordkeeping system, thereby making the information a permanent part of the nonresident's New Hampshire driving record;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Certify a copy of the nonresident's complete driving record and send it to the requesting law enforcement agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a national driver record repository is established the director may satisfy the requirements of subparagraph III(a) by obtaining the applicant's record from the repository.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No motor vehicle liability policy, as defined in RSA 259:61, shall be issued with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state, until a copy of the form of the policy has been on file with the insurance commissioner for at least 30 days, unless during that period the insurance commissioner shall have approved in writing the form of the policy, nor shall such policy be issued if the insurance commissioner notifies the insurance company in writing that, in his opinion, the form of the policy does not comply with the laws of the state.  Notification of his approval or disapproval shall be given in writing within said period.  The insurance commissioner shall approve a form of policy which contains the name and address of the insured, a description of the vehicles covered, with the premium charges therefor, the policy period, the limits of liability as between the insured and the insurance company, and an agreement that insurance is provided in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter.  The policy may provide that the insured, or any other person covered by the policy, shall reimburse the insurance carrier for payment made on account of any loss or damage claim or suit involving a breach of the terms, provisions or conditions of the policy;  and further, if the policy shall provide for limits in excess of the limits specified in this chapter, the insurance carrier may plead against any plaintiff, with respect to the amount of such excess limits of liability, any defenses which it may be entitled to plead against the insured, and any such policy may further provide for the prorating of the insurance thereunder with other applicable valid and collectible insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event that a company or filing or rating organization eliminates or reduces coverages, conditions or definitions in its policies issued under this section other than at the request of a policyholder, the company must attach to the policy a printed notice in each such policy explaining clearly what coverages, conditions or definitions have been eliminated or reduced.  If explanations of such reduced or eliminated coverages are not contained in the printed notice attached to its policies, then such coverages, conditions or definitions shall remain in full force and effect without such reductions or eliminations.  The requirements of this section shall apply only to such policies renewed or endorsed with the same company.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:15 Uninsured or Hit-and-Run Motor Vehicle Coverage. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as provided in paragraph I-a, no policy shall be issued under the provisions of RSA 264:14, with respect to a vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state, unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto at least in amounts and limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or drivers of uninsured motor vehicles, and hit-and-run vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death resulting therefrom.  When an insured elects to purchase liability insurance in an amount greater than the minimum coverage required by RSA 259:61, the insured's uninsured motorist coverage shall automatically be equal in amounts and limits to the liability coverage elected.  For the purposes of this paragraph umbrella or excess policies that provide excess limits to policies described in RSA 259:61 shall also provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to the limits of liability purchased, unless the named insured rejects such coverage in writing.  Rejection of such coverage by a named insured shall constitute a rejection of coverage by all insureds, shall apply to all vehicles then or thereafter eligible to be covered under the policy, and shall remain effective upon policy amendment or renewal, unless the named insured requests such coverage in writing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. No commercial motor vehicle liability policy issued under the provisions of RSA 264:14 shall be required to provide coverage for motor vehicles that are not owned by the policyholder for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or drivers of uninsured motor vehicles, and hit-and-run vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death resulting therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event of insolvency on the part of the liability insurer which prevents such insurer from paying the legal liability of its insured within the limits of the coverage provided, if no other insurance applies, uninsured motorist coverage shall provide for no less than $25,000 coverage for injury to or destruction of property in any one accident.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An insurer's extension of coverage, as provided in paragraph II, shall be applicable only to accidents occurring during a policy period in which its insured's uninsured motor vehicle coverage is in effect and where the liability insurer of the tort-feasor has been declared to be insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction as of the accident date, or has been declared to be insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction within 3 years after the accident date.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any insurer from extending coverage under terms and conditions more favorable to its insureds than is provided hereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the event of payment to any person under the coverage required by this section and subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage, the insurer making such payment shall, to the extent thereof, be entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any rights of recovery of such person against any person or organization legally responsible for the bodily injury for which such payment is made, including the proceeds recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer;  provided, however, with respect to payments made by reason of the extension of coverage described in paragraphs II and III, the insurer making such payment shall not be entitled to any right of recovery against such tort-feasor in excess of the proceeds recovered from the assets of the insolvent insurer of said tort-feasor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Every document tendered to settle a claim for bodily injury which may be the subject of coverage under this section shall prominently contain the following language, which shall be read and signed by the releasing party or parties:

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any motor vehicle liability policy, as defined in RSA 259:61, covering a private passenger automobile and issued with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state, shall provide medical payments coverage therein or supplemental thereto in an amount equal to or greater than $1,000 per person for medical costs incurred as a result of injuries sustained in an accident involving the insured vehicle by the driver and passengers in said vehicle.  Such coverage shall apply only to medical costs incurred during 3 years following the date the injuries are sustained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A health carrier, as defined in RSA 420-G:2, VIII, shall not coordinate benefits against medical payments coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Medical payments coverage shall not be assignable to any health care provider.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The insured shall have the exclusive right to submit a claim for medical expenses under either medical payments coverage or a health insurance policy or both, as the insured elects;  provided, however, an insured shall not be entitled to duplicate payment from medical payments coverage and a health insurance policy for the same medical expense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. This section shall not apply to any commercial policy insuring more than 4 automobiles, nor to any commercial policy covering a garage, automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station, public parking place operation hazards, or trucking operation.

<center><h3>Section 264:18</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:18 Required Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A motor vehicle liability policy, except as to coverage providing protection against uninsured motor vehicles required by RSA 264:14 shall be subject, with respect to accidents which occur in New Hampshire and within limits of liability required by this chapter, to the following provisions which need not be contained therein:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The liability of any company under a motor vehicle liability policy shall become absolute whenever loss or damage covered by said policy occurs, and the satisfaction by the insured of a final judgment for such loss or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right or duty of the company to make payment on account of said loss or damage.  No agreement between the company and the insured after the insured has incurred liability for loss or damage covered by the policy shall operate to defeat the company's liability to pay for such loss or damage.  Upon the recovery of a final judgment against any person for any loss or damage specified in this section, if the judgment debtor was, at the accrual of the cause of action, protected against liability therefor under a motor vehicle liability policy, the judgment creditor shall be entitled to have the insurance money applied to the satisfaction of the judgment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The policy, the written application therefor, if any, and any rider or indorsement, which shall not conflict with the provisions of this chapter, shall with the provisions of this section and any other applicable statutes constitute the entire contract between the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. With respect to accidents which occur within this state and subject to the minimum limits of liability validly made under the authority of RSA 259:61, the policy is to be interpreted with reference hereto and the liability of the company under the policy shall thereby become absolute upon the occurrence of such an accident;  no statement made by the insured or on his behalf, and no violation of exclusions, conditions, other terms, or language contained in the policy, and no unauthorized or unlawful use of the vehicle except as provided in paragraph VI of this section, whether or not a premium charge has been made and paid, shall operate to defeat or avoid the policy so as to bar recovery for such accidents within said limits of liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the death, insolvency, or bankruptcy of the insured shall occur within the policy period, the policy during the unexpired portion of such period shall cover the person or persons entitled to possession of the vehicle of the insured.  Such policy shall contain such provisions, not inconsistent with this chapter, as shall be required by the insurance commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In an action of tort where payment of the judgment is secured by a motor vehicle liability policy and where the defendant has been defaulted for failure to enter an appearance, damages shall not be assessed, except by special order of the court, until the expiration of 30 days after the plaintiff has given notice of such default to the company issuing or executing such policy and has filed an affidavit thereof.  Such notice may be given by mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the said company or to its agent who issued or executed such policy.  Upon receipt of information and having become satisfied that the insured has failed to comply with the terms of his policy in regard to notice to the company of an accident, the director shall revoke his license and registration for such period as the director shall determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The insurance applies to any person who has obtained possession or control of the vehicle of the insured with his express or implied consent even though the use in the course of which liability to pay damages arises has been expressly or impliedly forbidden by the insured or is otherwise unauthorized.  This provision, however, shall not apply to the use of a vehicle converted with the intent to wrongfully deprive the owner of his property therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. No liability insurer shall require that a bodily injury claim be settled or adjudicated as a condition precedent to the settlement of a property damage claim arising out of the same accident.  No evidence of settlement of a property damage claim shall be admissible as evidence of liability in the trial of any other cause of action arising out of the same accident.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:21 Methods of Giving Proof of Financial Responsibility. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Proof of financial responsibility when required under this chapter may be given by either of the following methods:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. By filing with the department a certificate, as defined in RSA 259, of an insurance company or of a surety company to satisfy any judgment or judgments for damages resulting from an accident reported to the director under the provisions of RSA 264:26.  Financial responsibility in the future may be given by filing with the department a continuous certificate which shall be a certificate as defined in RSA 259, of an insurance company or of a surety company, to provide the amount of proof of financial responsibility required under the provisions of RSA 264:20.  Every continuous certificate shall remain in effect no less than 20 days after written notice is received by the director that said continuous certificate shall be cancelled, except that a certificate subsequently filed shall, on its effective date, terminate a certificate previously filed with respect to any other vehicle designated in both certificates.  Whenever another vehicle replaces a vehicle described in a continuous certificate such continuous certificate covering such described vehicle shall apply automatically to such other vehicle registered by the insured as of the date of its registration to the insured and for the period, if any, not exceeding 10 days prior to such registration when said vehicle is driven on temporary plates and for a period of 15 days after the date of registration, unless said 20-day period after written notice of cancellation is received by the director has theretofore expired.  Such continuous certificate shall likewise apply automatically to any additional vehicle acquired by the insured as of the date of its registration to the insured and for the period, if any, not exceeding 10 days prior to such registration when such vehicle is driven on temporary plates and for a period of 15 days after the date of registration, unless said 20-day period after written notice of cancellation is received by the director has theretofore expired;  provided, however, that the insurance company or surety company insures all vehicles owned by the named insured at such date of registration, and that such continuous certificate shall apply to such additional vehicle only to the extent the insurance is applicable to all such previously owned vehicles;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. By the deposit of money or securities as provided in the following section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. By satisfying the director that any corporation has financial ability to comply with the requirements of this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:25 Conduct After Accident. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The driver of a vehicle who knows or should have known that he or she has just been involved in any accident which resulted in death, personal injury or damages to property, shall immediately stop such vehicle at the scene of the accident and give to the driver or owner of any other vehicle involved in said accident, and to any person injured, and to the owner of any property damaged, the driver's name and address, driver's license number, the registration number of the vehicle and the name and address of each occupant.  If by reason of injury, absence or removal from the place of the accident, or other cause, such injured person, or driver of such other vehicle, or owner of the property damaged, or any of them, is unable to understand or receive the information required in this section, such information shall be given to any uniformed police officer arriving at the scene of the accident or immediately to a police officer at the nearest police station.  Any person driving a vehicle which is in any manner involved in an accident or any person who owns a vehicle which was illegally parked when it was involved in an accident shall within 15 days after such accident report in writing to the division the facts required hereunder together with a statement of the circumstances if any person is injured or killed, or if damage to property is in excess of $1,000, unless the accident is investigated by a police officer, in which case a report filed by such officer shall satisfy the requirements of this section;  provided, however, that any person not otherwise required by this paragraph to file a report, who owns a vehicle which was involved in an accident, may file a report as provided by this paragraph.  Voluntary intoxication shall not constitute a defense in the matter of knowledge under the provisions of this section.  All reports, filed as required in this paragraph, shall be in the form prescribed by the director and shall contain information to enable the division to determine whether the requirements for the deposit of security under RSA 264:3 are inapplicable by reason of the existence of insurance or other exceptions specified in that chapter.  If such driver is physically or mentally incapable of making such report, the owner of the vehicle involved in such accident or the owner's representative shall, after learning of the accident, forthwith make such report.  The driver or the owner shall furnish such additional relevant information as the division shall require.  The provisions of this section shall be of general application and shall not be restricted to a way as defined in RSA 259.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No report required under paragraph I, nor any certificate issued by the director under the authority provided by this paragraph, may be used as evidence in any criminal trial arising out of a reported accident where the reporting party is a defendant except that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The director may use such report in connection with the director's duties under RSA 264:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The director may furnish upon demand of any party to a trial, or upon demand of any court or law enforcement agency, a certificate showing that a specified report has or has not been filed with the director, and, if such report has been made, the date, time and location of the accident, the names and addresses of the drivers and owners of the vehicles involved and the investigating officers if known.
