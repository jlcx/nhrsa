&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 264:21 Methods of Giving Proof of Financial Responsibility. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Proof of financial responsibility when required under this chapter may be given by either of the following methods:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. By filing with the department a certificate, as defined in RSA 259, of an insurance company or of a surety company to satisfy any judgment or judgments for damages resulting from an accident reported to the director under the provisions of RSA 264:26.  Financial responsibility in the future may be given by filing with the department a continuous certificate which shall be a certificate as defined in RSA 259, of an insurance company or of a surety company, to provide the amount of proof of financial responsibility required under the provisions of RSA 264:20.  Every continuous certificate shall remain in effect no less than 20 days after written notice is received by the director that said continuous certificate shall be cancelled, except that a certificate subsequently filed shall, on its effective date, terminate a certificate previously filed with respect to any other vehicle designated in both certificates.  Whenever another vehicle replaces a vehicle described in a continuous certificate such continuous certificate covering such described vehicle shall apply automatically to such other vehicle registered by the insured as of the date of its registration to the insured and for the period, if any, not exceeding 10 days prior to such registration when said vehicle is driven on temporary plates and for a period of 15 days after the date of registration, unless said 20-day period after written notice of cancellation is received by the director has theretofore expired.  Such continuous certificate shall likewise apply automatically to any additional vehicle acquired by the insured as of the date of its registration to the insured and for the period, if any, not exceeding 10 days prior to such registration when such vehicle is driven on temporary plates and for a period of 15 days after the date of registration, unless said 20-day period after written notice of cancellation is received by the director has theretofore expired;  provided, however, that the insurance company or surety company insures all vehicles owned by the named insured at such date of registration, and that such continuous certificate shall apply to such additional vehicle only to the extent the insurance is applicable to all such previously owned vehicles;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. By the deposit of money or securities as provided in the following section;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. By satisfying the director that any corporation has financial ability to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
