<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This chapter shall apply to nonresidents.  If a nonresident has failed to furnish security or to give proof of his financial responsibility in the future as required hereunder, then he shall not drive any vehicle in this state nor shall any such vehicle owned by him be driven within this state by any person, and the director shall not issue to such nonresident any driver's license or register any such vehicle owned by such nonresident except in the same manner as required with respect to a resident of this state.  The driving by a nonresident, or with his express or implied consent if an owner, of a vehicle on a way of the state shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such nonresident of the director or his successor in office, to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful processes in any action against him, growing out of any accident in which said nonresident may be involved while so driving or so permitting to be driven a vehicle on such a way.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a nonresident's privilege of driving a motor vehicle or the privilege to have any vehicle registered to such individual driven in New Hampshire or both have been suspended under the provisions of this chapter, the department shall transmit a copy of the record of such action to the official in charge of the issuance of licenses and registrations in the state in which such nonresident resides, if the law of such state provides for action in relation thereto similar to that provided for in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a nonresident has been arrested for a serious traffic violation as defined in RSA 259:98-a, the director, upon receipt of a written or computer-generated request from a law enforcement agency, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Secure a copy of the nonresident's motor vehicle record from the state in which the nonresident resides;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enter the nonresident's motor vehicle record into the department's recordkeeping system, thereby making the information a permanent part of the nonresident's New Hampshire driving record;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Certify a copy of the nonresident's complete driving record and send it to the requesting law enforcement agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a national driver record repository is established the director may satisfy the requirements of subparagraph III(a) by obtaining the applicant's record from the repository.
