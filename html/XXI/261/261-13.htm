&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 261:13 Certificate of Origin. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
When a new vehicle is delivered in this state by the manufacturer to his agent or his franchised dealer, the manufacturer shall execute and deliver to his agent or his franchised dealer a certificate of origin in the form prescribed by the director, and no person shall bring into this state any new vehicle unless he has in his possession the certificate of origin as prescribed by the director.  The certificate of origin shall contain the vehicle identification number of the motor vehicle, the name of the manufacturer, model year, year of manufacture, number of cylinders, a general description of the body, if any, and the type of model.  When a new vehicle is sold in this state, the manufacturer, his agent or his franchised dealer shall execute and deliver to the purchaser, in case of an absolute sale, assignment of the certificate of origin, or, if other than absolute sale, assignment of the certificate of origin subject to contract, signed or executed by the manufacturer, his agent or his dealer, with the genuine names and business or residence addresses of both stated thereon, and certified to have been executed with full knowledge of the contents and with the consent of both purchaser and seller.  No manufacturer, distributor, or manufacturer's authorized agent shall issue any duplicate, supplemental, or replacement certificate of origin unless the legend "duplicate'' is placed on said certificate and the director is notified in writing of the circumstances under which said certificate was issued.  A dealer registered under the provisions of RSA 261 who makes a courtesy delivery shall prepare the title application and supporting documents, but said delivery shall not be construed as a sale by the New Hampshire dealer.
