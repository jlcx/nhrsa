&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 261:74-n Collection of Fees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Dealer agents shall collect the fees required to process motor vehicle registrations, permits for registration, transfers of registrations, and title applications as set forth in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a dealer agent processes motor vehicle registrations, permits for registration, transfers of registration, and title applications the applicable town or city or clerk shall receive the following fees through the dealer agent and the EVR integrator:  the registration permit fee under RSA 261:153, I, the town clerk fee under RSA 261:152, the town clerk and dealer title application fees under RSA 261:4, IV, the municipal agent fee under RSA 261:74-d, and, when applicable, the waste reclamation fee under RSA 261:153, V, the municipal transportation improvement fee under RSA 261:153, VI, the collection of permit fees in unorganized places under RSA 261:160, and the public parking facilities fee under RSA 261:154.  The town or city may use the fees received under this paragraph to offset the expenses of examination and auditing of the EVR program, if required.  Towns, cities, and the state shall inform the EVR integrator annually as to the details of the fees listed in this paragraph and provide timely notice to the EVR integrator of any changes to fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a registration permit applicant resides in a town that assesses, levies, or collects a resident tax pursuant to RSA 72:1, the applicant shall comply with the provisions of RSA 261:71 either by showing or causing to be shown to the dealer agent a tax receipt or by executing the affidavit permitted under RSA 261:71 at the time of sale.  If a resident tax town electronically shares resident tax data with the EVR integrator, neither the affidavit nor tax receipt is needed if such data reveals the resident tax has been paid.  An applicant shall not be permitted to register a vehicle if such data reveals that the applicant is delinquent in paying the resident tax.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the applicant resides in a town or city which has adopted the provisions of RSA 231:130-a and the town or city has provided notification of unpaid fines to the electronic vehicle registration integrator pursuant to 231:130-a, III, a dealer agent shall not issue a registration permit to the applicant unless the town or city clerk's records reveal no outstanding parking violations in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No dealer agent shall assume or absorb any fee listed in paragraph II owed by a customer or advertise or assert that the dealer will assume or absorb such fee.  Any violation of this paragraph shall subject the dealer agent to a fine of $100 per violation.
