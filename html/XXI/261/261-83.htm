I. A tractor shall qualify for farm tractor registration rates and shall be driven with such registration only when the tractor is used exclusively for agricultural purposes or to draw another vehicle in such a way that part of the load is carried on such towing vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a farm tractor that is fitted with attachments such as cultivators, loaders, or other equipment, specific to the activities of the farm, or a specialized vehicle such as a backhoe, bulldozer, excavator, grader, or loader, shall qualify for farm tractor registration rates and number plates, provided that it is being used exclusively for agriculture and farming purposes, and not being used for hire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For a person using a specialized vehicle under paragraph II to be eligible for the issuance of a farm tractor plate, the applicant shall sign the following form which the treasurer of a city or such other official as the city government may designate or the town clerk shall provide.  This form shall be provided to the applicant upon request without further evidence from the applicant that the plate shall be used for purposes of this section.

I, the undersigned, fully understand the limitations concerning the use of specialized vehicles such as backhoes, bulldozers, excavators, graders, or loaders registered under RSA 261:83, and hereby certify that my vehicle will be used only for agricultural and farming purposes and uses incidental thereto.
