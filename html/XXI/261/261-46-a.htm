<codesect>
The director may design and issue a temporary vehicle registration which shall expire no later than 6 months from the date of issue, for the purpose of registering a vehicle belonging to a foreign national who enters this state and intends to utilize this state as his residence on a temporary basis.  The director shall in all cases require proof satisfactory to him of residence in a foreign country, legal entry into this country, and ownership of the vehicle, and shall collect the same fee as a resident would pay for a full 12 month registration, plus a sum equal to the municipal permit fee, for the use of the state.
