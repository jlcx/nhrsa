<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A retail dealer and member of the dealer's family domiciled in the dealer's household, may use the dealer's registration on vehicles owned by the dealer for personal use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Motor vehicles owned by the dealer which are designed for and engaged in the day-to-day business activities of the dealership, including but not limited to the transportation of freight or merchandise, such as auto parts delivery trucks, shall not be so registered.  Wreckers, ramp trucks, and service trucks may be registered if incidental to the business activities of the dealership and marked not for hire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The dealer's employees who are employed full-time in the retail motor vehicle business may be issued a dealer plate on motor vehicles owned by the dealer, at the dealer's discretion, for personal use outside of normal business hours.  For purposes of this paragraph, only the dealer's employees and no other person shall operate such motor vehicles.  Personal use shall require that the motor vehicle be in saleable condition, with all legally required window stickers as appropriate, in view to the general public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Motorized or non-motorized vehicles owned by the dealer shall not be rented or otherwise used while registered under the dealer's registration, except for demonstration purposes, for use by a franchisor or distributor or agent or employee thereof, or for loaning or renting to a customer whose vehicle is being serviced in connection with the vehicle business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Dealer registration shall not be used on motorized or non-motorized vehicles owned by another person unless there exists a valid consignment agreement, or unless the vehicle is being demonstrated or transported in connection with service or sales.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A retail vehicle dealer may use the dealer registration to operate a vehicle on the ways of this state when transporting the vehicle from a place of purchase to the dealer's place of business if the vehicle bears a valid inspection sticker from any state unless a clear violation of RSA 266:1 is apparent from visual observation.
