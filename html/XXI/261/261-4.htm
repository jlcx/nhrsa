&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The application for the first certificate of title of a vehicle in this state shall be made by the owner to the department on the form the director prescribes and shall contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name, residence and mailing address of the owner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A description of the vehicle including, so far as the following data exists, its make, model, vehicle identification number, model year, type of body, the number of cylinders and whether new or used;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The date of purchase by the applicant, the name and address of the person from whom the vehicle was acquired and the names and addresses of any lienholders in the order of their priority and the dates of their security agreements and, if a new vehicle, the application shall be accompanied by the manufacturer's or importer's certificate of origin;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any further information the director reasonably requires to identify the vehicle and to enable him to determine whether the owner is entitled to a certificate of title and the existence or nonexistence of security interests in the vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the application refers to a vehicle purchased from a dealer, it shall contain the name and address of any lienholder holding a security interest created or reserved at the time of the sale and the date of the security agreement and be signed by the dealer as well as the owner, and the dealer shall within 10 days of the date of sale mail or deliver to the department the application and other supporting documents as required by the director, except when the title is in the possession of a lienholder at the time of sale in which event the dealer shall have 40 days from the date of sale to mail or deliver to the department the application and other supporting documents as required by the director.  A dealer who makes a courtesy delivery shall prepare the title application and supporting documents, but said delivery shall not be construed as a sale by the New Hampshire dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the application refers to a vehicle last previously registered in another state or country, the application shall contain or be accompanied by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any certificate of title issued by the other state or country.  Said certificate shall either be printed in the English language, or a notarized translation of the certificate shall be provided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any other information and documents the director reasonably requires to establish the ownership of the vehicle and the existence or nonexistence of security interests in it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The certificate of a person authorized by the director that the vehicle identification number of the vehicle has been inspected and found to conform to the description given in the application, or any other proof of the identity of the vehicle the director reasonably requires.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall furnish every town clerk and may furnish to certain dealers and financial institutions, forms for application for certificate of title and shall have such forms available at the office of the division.  Said forms shall be prepared in typewritten form from information supplied by the owner, either by an employee of the division, town clerk, such dealer or such financial institution.  Every application for certificate of title shall be examined by the town clerk to determine whether it has been completed according to law.  For preparation, examination, record keeping, and filing of such forms as herein provided a town clerk shall be paid a fee of $2 by the owner of each application, which shall be in addition to any other fees required under the provisions of this chapter.  For preparation of such forms and remittance of required fees by such a dealer or such a financial institution, said dealer or institution may charge a maximum fee of $2.  In the event said dealer or institution charges more than said maximum, he or it shall be guilty of a violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the application refers to a vehicle not purchased from a dealer, the application and other supporting documents as required by the director, shall within 20 days of the date of sale be mailed or delivered to the department by the owner.
