<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director may revoke or suspend a dealer's agent status for any violation of law or rule governing electronic vehicle registration, any violation of the dealer agent's security and record-keeping plan, revocation or suspension of the dealer license, or any other action that in the director's opinion adversely affects the registration system.  If the director determines that a dealer agent has not continued to fulfill the requirements of this subdivision or has violated any of the rules adopted pursuant to this subdivision, the director shall commence a process to suspend or revoke the agent status of the dealer.  The director shall take into account concerns of towns, cities, and the EVR advisory group established under RSA 261:74-s, IV about dealer agents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any dealer agent whose appointment is sought to be suspended or revoked shall be afforded the opportunity for a hearing before the bureau of hearings prior to such suspension or revocation.  Following the hearing, the director may suspend or revoke the appointment as dealer agent upon satisfactory evidence of malfeasance, misfeasance, theft, financial instability, or violation of the rules adopted under this subdivision and that the revocation or suspension is in the best interest of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the revocation of such agent status, the dealer agent shall surrender to the department or its authorized agent all materials issued by the state under the provision of this subdivision and all records pertaining to all matters authorized by this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Whenever an authorized auditor of the state of New Hampshire or the department determines that the public interest requires immediate action, the director may issue a temporary order suspending the authority of a dealer agent to register or transfer registrations, pending a hearing.
