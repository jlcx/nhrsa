I. The director may permit the owner of an antique motor vehicle or motorcycle, as defined in RSA 259:4, or trailer, as defined in paragraph II of this section, to use a registration plate which was issued in the same year that the antique motor vehicle, motorcycle, or trailer was manufactured, provided the motor vehicle, motorcycle, or trailer is registered as an antique motor vehicle, motorcycle, or trailer under this chapter, and the number of the antique plate is recorded with the director.  Registration plates issued in the same year that the antique motor vehicle was manufactured may be affixed to both the front and rear of the antique motor vehicle, to either the front or rear of the antique motorcycle, and to the rear of the antique trailer for any such vehicle with a year of manufacture of 1960 or earlier if the registration plate matching the registration certificate is carried within the antique motor vehicle.  Any antique motor vehicle, motorcycle, or trailer bearing a registration plate with the year of manufacture shall also carry, within it, a valid antique motor vehicle, motorcycle, or trailer registration certificate and a permit issued under this section.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section, "trailer'' means any vehicle with a single axle and one tire on each side of the axle, without motive power, designed for carrying passengers or property wholly on its own structure and for being drawn by a self-propelled vehicle.
