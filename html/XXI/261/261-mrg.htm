<codesect>
Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 261:2 and RSA 261:148, no person shall register a motor vehicle exempted under RSA 261:3, I(k) in this state without first providing a previously issued, current or expired New Hampshire certificate of registration, a valid New Hampshire or out-of-state certificate of title, an application for a certificate of title, or a current New Hampshire vehicle identification number verification form as prescribed by the director.  For the purposes of this section, a temporary registration issued pursuant to RSA 261:57 does not meet the requirement of a previously issued New Hampshire certificate of registration.  The town or city clerk that issues the permit may copy the bill of sale and the New Hampshire certificate of registration or the certificate of title for their records, but shall return the original bill of sale and the New Hampshire certificate of registration or the certificate of title to the person registering the vehicle upon issuing the permit.  Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the interest of the owner is terminated or the vehicle is sold under a security agreement by a lienholder named in the certificate of title, the transferee shall promptly mail or deliver to the department the last certificate of title, his application for a new certificate in the form the director prescribes, and an affidavit made by or on behalf of the lienholder that the vehicle was repossessed and that the interest of the owner was lawfully terminated or sold pursuant to the terms of the security agreement.  If the lienholder succeeds to the interest of the owner and holds the vehicle for resale, he need not secure a new certificate of title but, upon transfer to another person, shall promptly mail or deliver to the transferee or to the department the certificate, affidavit and other documents required to be sent to the director by the transferee.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person holding a certificate of title whose interest in the vehicle has been extinguished or transferred other than by voluntary transfer shall mail or deliver the certificate to the department upon request of the department.  The delivery of the certificate pursuant to the request of the department does not affect the rights of the person surrendering the certificate, and the action of the department issuing a new certificate of title as provided herein is not conclusive upon the rights of an owner or lienholder named in the old certificate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 261:17 Joint Tenancy With Rights of Survivorship. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon the death of a married resident owner of a motor vehicle registered in this state, said motor vehicle, if used for family purposes, shall be deemed to have been jointly held property with right of survivorship unless otherwise designated on the certificate of title, and the interest of said decedent shall pass to his or her surviving spouse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Where a certificate of title has been issued on the vehicle the surviving spouse may transfer the vehicle pursuant to RSA 261:14 without obtaining a new certificate of title.  The signature of the surviving spouse on the certificate and a copy of the death record shall be deemed valid and sufficient for the proper transfer of the motor vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Where no certificate of title has been issued on the vehicle and where such transfer requires the issuance of a certificate of title, a first certificate of title shall be immediately issued to said spouse upon the following conditions;  application shall be made to the department including information required by RSA 261:4, I(a) and (b), accompanied by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A copy of the death record;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The required fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Individuals who are joint owners may provide for survivorship.  If their joint ownership is held by using "and'' between their names, they may obtain title as joint tenants with rights of survivorship by designating this preference on their title application.  If their joint ownership is held by using "or'' between their names, no other designation is required.  Upon the death of one of the owners, the surviving owner may transfer the vehicle pursuant to RSA 261:14 without obtaining a new title.  The signature of the surviving owner on the record and a copy of the death record shall be deemed valid and sufficient for the proper transfer of the motor vehicle.  One of the joint owners may be a nonresident, who shall be exempt from the requirements of RSA 261:71 for the purposes of this section only.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless excepted by RSA 261:23, a security interest in a vehicle of a type for which a certificate of title is required is not valid against creditors of the owner or subsequent transferees or lienholders of the vehicle unless perfected as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A security interest is perfected by the delivery to the department of the existing certificate of title, if any, an application for a certificate of title containing the name and address of the lienholder and the date of his security agreement and the required fee.  It is perfected as of the time of its creation if delivery is completed within 20 days thereafter, otherwise as of the time of the delivery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a vehicle is subject to a security interest when brought into this state, the validity of the security interest is determined by law of the jurisdiction where the vehicle was when the security interest attached, subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the parties understood at the time the security interest attached that the vehicle would be kept in this state and it was brought into this state within 30 days thereafter for purposes other than transportation through this state, the validity of the security interest in this state is determined by the law of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the security interest was perfected under the law of the jurisdiction where the vehicle was when the security interest attached, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the name of the lienholder is shown on an existing certificate of title issued by that jurisdiction, his security interest continues perfected in this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the name of the lienholder is not shown on an existing certificate of title issued by that jurisdiction, the security interest continues perfected in this state for 4 months after a first certificate of title of the vehicle is issued in this state, and also thereafter if, within the 4-month period, it is perfected in this state.  The security interest may also be perfected in this state after the expiration of the 4-month period;  in that case perfection dates from the time of perfection in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the security interest was not perfected under the law of the jurisdiction where the vehicle was when the security interest attached, it may be perfected in this state;  in that case, perfection dates from the time of perfection in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A security interest may be perfected under part (2) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph or subparagraph (c) of this paragraph either as provided in paragraph II or by the lienholder delivering to the department a notice of security interest in the form the director prescribes and the required fee.

<center>
<p>
ARTICLE I. PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Purposes of Agreement.  It is the purpose of this agreement to set up a system whereby any contracting state may permit owners of fleets of buses operating in 2 or more states to prorate the registration of the buses in such fleets in each state in which the fleets operate on the basis of the proportion of miles operated within such states to total fleet miles, as defined herein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Principle of Proration of Registration.  It is hereby declared that in making this agreement the contracting states adhere to the principle that each state should have the freedom to develop the kind of highway user tax structure that it determines to be most appropriate to itself, that the method of taxation of interstate buses should not be a determining factor in developing its user tax structure, and that annual taxes or other taxes of the fixed fee type upon buses which are not imposed on a basis that reflects the amount of highway use should be apportioned among the states, within the limits of practicality, on the basis of vehicle miles traveled within each of the states.

<center>
<p>
ARTICLE IV. PRORATION OF REGISTRATION
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Applicability.  Any owner of a fleet may register the buses of said fleet in any contracting state by paying to said state total registration fees in an amount equal to that obtained by applying the proportion of in-state fleet miles divided by the total fleet miles, to the total fees which would otherwise be required for regular registration of each and all of such vehicles in such contracting state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
All fleet pro-rata registration fees shall be based upon the mileage proportions of the fleet during the period of 12 months ending on August 31 next preceding the commencement of the registration year for which registration is sought:  Except, that mileage proportions for a fleet not operated during such period in the state where application for registration is made will be determined by the administrator upon the sworn application of the applicant showing the operations during such period in other states and the estimated operations during the registration year for which registration is sought, in the state in which application is being made;  or if no operations were conducted during such period a full statement of the proposed method of operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If any buses operate in 2 or more states which permit proration of registration on the basis of a fleet of buses consisting of a lesser number of vehicles than provided in Article II(g), such fleet may be prorated as to registration in such states, in which event the buses in such fleet shall not be required to register in any other contracting states if each such vehicle is registered in some contracting state (except to the extent it is exempt from registration as provided in Article III(b)).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If the administrator of any state determines, based on his method of the operation thereof, that the inclusion of a bus or buses as a part of a fleet would adversely affect the proper fleet fee which should be paid to his state, having due regard for fairness and equity, he may refuse to permit any or all of such buses to be included in his state as a part of such fleet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Total Fleet Miles.  Total fleet miles, with respect to each contracting state, shall mean the total miles operated by the fleet (1) in such state, (2) in all other contracting states, (3) in other states having proportional registration provisions, (4) in states with which such contracting state has reciprocity, and (5) in such other states as the administrator determines should be included under the circumstances in order to protect or promote the interest of his state;  except that in states having laws requiring proration on the basis of a different determination of total fleet miles, total fleet miles shall be determined on such basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Leased Vehicles.  If a bus is operated by a person other than the owner as a part of a fleet which is subject to the provisions of this article, then the operator of such fleet shall be deemed to be the owner of said bus for the purposes of this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Extent of Privileges.  Upon the registration of a fleet in a contracting state pursuant to this article, each bus in the fleet may be operated in both interstate and intrastate operations in such state (except as provided in Article III(e)).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Application for Proration.  The application for proration of registration shall be made in each contracting state upon substantially the application forms and supplements authorized by joint action of the administrators of the contracting states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Issuance of Identification.  Upon registration of a fleet, the state which is the base state of a particular bus of the fleet shall issue the required license plates and registration card for such bus;  and each contracting state in which the fleet of which such bus is a part operates shall issue a special identification identifying such bus as a part of a fleet which has fully complied with the registration requirements of such state.  The required license plates, registration cards and identification shall be appropriately displayed in the manner required by or pursuant to the laws of each respective state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Additions to Fleet.  If any bus is added to a prorated fleet after the filing of the original application, the owner shall file a supplemental application.  The owner shall register such bus in each contracting state in like manner as provided for buses listed in an original application and the registration fee payable shall be determined on the mileage proportion used to determine the registration fees payable for buses registered under the original application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Withdrawals from Fleet.  If any bus is withdrawn from a prorated fleet during the period for which it is registered or identified, the owner shall notify the administrator of each state in which it is registered or identified of such withdrawal and shall return the plates, and registration card or identification as may be required by or pursuant to the laws of the respective states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Audits.  The administrator of each contracting state shall, within the statutory authority of such administrator, make any information obtained upon an audit of records of any applicant for proration of registration available to the administrators of the other contracting states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Errors in Registration.  If it is determined by the administrator of a contracting state, as a result of such audits or otherwise, that an improper fee has been paid his state, or errors in registration found, the administrator may require the fleet owner to make the necessary corrections in the registration of his fleet and payment of fees.
<center>
<p>
ARTICLE V. RECIPROCITY
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Grant of Reciprocity.  Each of the contracting states grants reciprocity as provided in this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Applicability.  The provisions of this agreement with respect to reciprocity shall apply only to a bus properly registered in the base state of the bus, which state must be a contracting state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Non-Applicability to Fleet Buses.  The reciprocity granted pursuant to this article shall not apply to a bus which is entitled to be registered or identified as part of a prorated fleet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Extent of Reciprocity.  The reciprocity granted pursuant to this article shall permit the interstate operation of a bus and intrastate operation which is incidental to a trip of such bus involving interstate operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Other Agreements.  Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prohibit any of the contracting states from entering into separate agreements with each other for the granting of temporary permits for the intrastate operation of vehicles registered in the state;  nor to prevent any of the contracting states from entering into agreements to grant reciprocity for intrastate operation within any zone or zones agreed upon by the states.
<center>
<p>
ARTICLE VI. WITHDRAWAL OR REVOCATION
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Any contracting state may withdraw from this agreement upon 30 days written notice to each other contracting state, which notice shall be given only after the repeal of this agreement by the legislature of such state, if adoption was by legislative act, or after renunciation by the appropriate administrative official of such contracting state if the laws thereof empower him so to renounce.
<center>
<p>
ARTICLE VII. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

III. Implements of husbandry shall not be operated on toll roads or on the interstate and defense highway system.  When implements of husbandry not meeting the definition of a tractor in RSA 259:108 are moved over any other way, the power unit shall display in a conspicuous location an identifying decal or plate issued by the division.  The identifying decal or plate issued by the division is not a registration and shall not require the municipal permit for registration described in RSA 261:148.  The fee for each identifying decal or plate shall be $15 for an implement weighing no more than 15,000 pounds and $25 for an implement weighing 15,001 pounds or more.  The identifying decal or plate shall not require annual renewal but shall expire upon a change of ownership of the implement.  The director may adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A specifying the location for display of the identifying decal or plate, specifying such limitations as the director deems necessary for the safety of other highway users by restricting speeds of operation and operation after daylight hours, and specifying safety, conspicuity, and lighting equipment requirements.

If the registration fee of said vehicle is the same or less than that of the one first registered by him, he shall pay no additional fee, but if the fee is greater, he shall pay the difference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the owner of any vehicle desires to transfer a vehicle registration from one vehicle to another without transferring the ownership of the original vehicle, this may be accomplished by filing a new application with the department stating that the transfer does not involve a change of ownership of the original vehicle;  provided, however, if the registration fee is the same or less than that of the first vehicle registered by him, he shall pay no additional fee, but if the fee is greater he shall pay the difference, and further provided, that once the original registration has been transferred to another vehicle, it shall not be again transferred back to the original vehicle.  The original vehicle shall require a new registration.

IV. Any person who owns a vehicle shall be entitled to transfer the vehicle registration on that vehicle to a leased vehicle and any person who leases a vehicle shall be entitled to transfer the vehicle registration on that vehicle to an owned or leased vehicle and shall be given the same credit for this transfer as for any transfer of ownership provided under paragraphs I-III of this section.  The registration shall be processed to expire according to the formula set forth in RSA 261:62.  If the transfer extends the expiration of the existing registration, pro-rated fees shall be charged for the additional months in the new registration period.  If the transfer shortens the registration period from the existing registration period, no refund shall be issued.  Any person who obtains a vehicle transfer pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the vehicle transfer fee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 261:74-s Agreements With Electronic Vehicle Registration Integrators. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon approval of the attorney general and governor and council, the department may enter into an agreement with an electronic vehicle registration integrator to provide, at no cost to the state, any necessary hardware, software, or network connections between dealer agents, the department, and towns for the electronic transmittal and receipt of registration and title data and money.  The electronic vehicle registration integrator shall be authorized in the agreement to collect and transfer funds electronically from the dealers to the department, towns, cities, or town clerks, where appropriate.  RSA 261:141-b and RSA 80:52-c shall not apply to electronic transfers to or from an electronic vehicle registration integrator or a dealer agent.  Electronic vehicle registration integrators shall transmit funds within one business day of the completion of the registration to the appropriate entity if the entity accepts electronic transfers of funds and within 20 days to any other entity.  The transmittal of funds by an EVR integrator to a town or city or the state pursuant to this section shall not be considered a delegation of a town's, city's, or state's deposit function as set forth in RSA 41:29.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An agreement under this section shall provide for minimum standards established by the department and the department of information technology for transfers of data and funds, financial solvency of the electronic vehicle registration integrator, training of dealer-agents, and town clerks, if necessary, by the electronic vehicle registration integrator, implementation of an electronic vehicle registration integrator "help line'' to assist dealer agents, automatic and accurate calculation of all fees required by this chapter, electronic transmittal of applicable documents to the towns, cities, and state, bonding to indemnify the state, municipalities, and dealer agents in the event of loss, security, and privacy of motor vehicle records, access by state-appointed auditors to the records and reports of the electronic vehicle registration integrator, minimum standards for the accuracy and timeliness of submission of data and funds, reporting to the state, towns, or cities, transmittal of fees required to register a motor vehicle, issue a permit for registration, transfer a motor vehicle registration, or title a vehicle provided said fees are transmitted to the appropriate entity in the manner set forth in this chapter, conditions for cancellation of the agreement, and the other requirements related to the efficient and economical administration of this subdivision.  The reporting to the towns, cities, and state shall provide notice of registrations processed, allow proper and accurate collection and remittance of town or city moneys, allow integration of data and moneys into software used by towns and cities to transmit registration data to the state, allow towns and cities to clearly identify the particular fees collected and remitted, and provide vehicle specific data including the maker's list price, and vehicle make and model.  The department shall solicit input from affected municipalities before entering into an agreement under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To ensure the EVR integrator and dealer agents are accurately calculating the applicable fees and properly transmitting the fees and data, and that towns and cities may integrate the data and fees into the software used by towns and cities to transmit registration data to the state, the EVR program shall be implemented as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The first year of the EVR program shall involve a limited number of dealers and towns and cities as determined by the director and a single EVR integrator to ensure that the EVR program is successfully implemented.  The director shall select which towns, cities, and dealers shall participate during the first year from a list of desiring volunteers submitted to the director by the senate president and the speaker of the house of representatives within 60 days of the effective date of this section.  The director shall select the participants after obtaining the input of the New Hampshire City and Town Clerks' Association and the New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association.  The director shall ensure that a combination of large and small municipalities and large and small dealers are included in the initial group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) After the EVR program has operated for 270 days, the director shall seek formal input from the EVR advisory group established in paragraph IV and towns, cities, and dealer agents involved in the program as to whether or not the EVR integrator and dealer agents are properly calculating and assessing applicable fees, properly transmitting the fees and data, and properly integrating data and moneys into the software used by towns and cities to transmit registration data to the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) After no more than 365 days of operation, the director, with consultation from the EVR advisory group established in paragraph IV, shall determine if the EVR program has achieved material compliance with the requirements set forth in RSA 261:74-h through RSA 261:74-s.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The director, upon determining under subparagraph (c) that the EVR program has either achieved material compliance or has not achieved material compliance, shall report the basis for the determination to the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the senate and house standing committees with jurisdiction over commerce, and shall include any recommendations for statutory changes that may be necessary, in his or her opinion, to facilitate material compliance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If the director determines that there is a failure of the EVR program to materially comply with the requirements, he or she may, upon consultation with the EVR advisory group established in paragraph IV, authorize an additional 180 days of operation of the program to allow the achievement of material compliance with the requirements.  No later than the one hundred eightieth day of the extension, the director shall, with consultation with the EVR advisory group, determine if material compliance with the requirements has been achieved.  If material compliance has not been achieved by the end of the extension, the program shall end.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Upon achievement of material compliance with the requirements of the EVR program, the director, upon consultation with the EVR advisory group established in paragraph IV, shall develop a plan to bring all remaining towns and cities who are municipal agents under RSA 261:74-a into the EVR program and allow additional dealer agents to apply for inclusion in the program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 261:153 Fees for Registration Permits. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The treasurer of each city, or such other person as the city government may designate, and the town clerk of each town shall collect fees for such permits as follows:  on each vehicle offered for registration a sum equal to 18 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for a current model year vehicle, 15 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the first preceding model year vehicle, 12 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the second preceding model year vehicle, 9 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the third preceding model year vehicle, 6 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the fourth preceding model year vehicle, and 3 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the fifth preceding model year vehicle and any model year prior thereto.  In no event, however, shall the fee be less than $5.  Registration permit fees for construction equipment, as defined in RSA 259:42, shall be governed by RSA 261:64.  The director shall make the final determination of any vehicle model year in any case in which a dispute arises.  The fee collected hereunder for a vehicle used only in the manner and for the purposes specified in RSA 261:82 shall be $5;  and provided further, that the fee collected hereunder for a farm tractor shall be $5.  In cases of doubt, the director may investigate for the purpose of determining eligibility for limited purpose registrations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In all cases the manufacturer's list price shall be rounded off to the nearest $100 and the actual permit fee shall be rounded off to the nearest dollar.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the permit is issued for a vehicle specified in RSA 261:141, III in a month other than the month in which the anniversary of the owner's birth occurs, the amount of the permit fee shall be changed as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the month in which the anniversary of the owner's birth occurs will be one of the next 4 months, the permit fee shall be increased by  1/12 for each whole month or part thereof remaining until the end of the month in which such anniversary will occur and the owner shall not be required to obtain a permit for the next registration period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In all other cases for vehicles specified in RSA 261:141, III the permit fee shall be determined by multiplying  1/12 of the permit fee for the vehicle times the total number of whole months and any part of a month remaining until the end of the month in which the anniversary of the owner's birth occurs, and the owner shall be required to obtain a permit for the next registration period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Each designated city official as the city government may designate and the town clerk of each town shall use the straight line method in computing fees stipulated in paragraph I for any registration.  The straight line method means that no registrant shall pay less or more than 12 months at each stipulated mill rate, whether such 12 months extend over one or more registration periods.  The mill rate to be charged on a vehicle originally offered for registration by a registrant shall be based on the year of manufacture of the said vehicle and shall continue for the next 12 months, including the month of registration.  For each successive 12 months registration of the same vehicle thereafter, whether or not such 12 months registration extends beyond one or more registration periods, the fees to be charged shall be computed successively at the next lower mill rate;  provided, that the minimum rate to be charged for any registration shall always be 3 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price of a vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Beginning July 1, 1989, in addition to each registration fee collected under paragraph I, there may be collected an additional fee for the purposes of a town reclamation trust fund as established in RSA 149-M:18.  Of this amount, $.50 shall be retained by the city official designated by the city government or by the town clerk for administrative costs and the remaining amount shall be deposited into the reclamation trust fund established by the town for the purpose of paying collection and disposal fees for the town's motor vehicle waste and paying for the recycling and reclamation of other types of solid waste.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "motor vehicle waste'' means "motor vehicle waste'' as defined in RSA 149-M:18.  A town which collects such additional fees shall not charge a disposal fee for motor vehicle waste at the town's solid waste disposal facility.  If a town finds the additional fee is not sufficient to cover fees for collection and disposal of town motor vehicle waste, it shall notify the office of energy and planning.  The office shall study the fee in accordance with RSA 4-C:1 and make recommendations, if necessary, for increases in the fee.  The additional fee schedule shall be graduated by class of vehicle as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The fee for heavy vehicles, including mobile homes and house trailers, heavy trucks and truck-tractors whose gross weight exceeds 18,000 pounds, and buses shall be $5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless otherwise provided, the fee for automobiles, light vehicles including trucks, and commercial motorized vehicles including tractor trailers, shall be $3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Unless otherwise provided, the fee for special use vehicles including all-terrain vehicles, agricultural and farm vehicles, and antique vehicles and for 2-wheeled vehicles including mopeds, motorcycles, and automobile utility trailers, shall be $2.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Beginning on July 1, 1997, in addition to the motor vehicle registration fees collected under paragraphs I and V, the legislative body of a municipality may vote to collect an additional fee for the purpose of supporting a municipal and transportation improvement fund, which shall be a capital reserve fund established for this purpose and governed by the provisions of RSA 34 and RSA 35 for cities and towns, respectively.  Of the amount collected, up to 10 percent, but not more than $0.50 of each fee paid, may be retained by the local official designated by the municipal government or by the town or city clerk for administrative costs.  The remaining amount shall be deposited into the municipal transportation improvement fund established to allow a community to fund, wholly or in part, improvements in the local or regional transportation system including roads, bridges, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, parking and intermodal facilities and public transportation.  The funds may be used for engineering, right-of-way acquisition, and construction costs of transportation facilities, and for operating and capital costs of public transportation only.  The funds may be used as matching funds for state or federal funds allocated for local or regional transportation improvements.  Such funds shall not be used to offset any other non-transportation appropriations made by the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The maximum fee charged under this paragraph shall be $5.  The municipality shall establish the required fee, up to the maximum amount allowable, based on anticipated funding needs for transportation improvements.  The additional fee shall be collected from all vehicles, both passenger and commercial, with the exception of all terrain vehicles as defined in RSA 215-A:1, I-b and antique motor vehicles or motorcycles, as defined in RSA 259:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any town or city may adopt the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) for an optional additional motor vehicle registration fee to fund municipal transportation improvements in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In a town, the question shall be placed on the warrant of a special or annual town meeting under the procedures set out in RSA 39:3, and shall be voted on by ballot.  In a city, the legislative body may consider and act upon the question in accordance with their normal procedures for passage of resolutions, ordinances, and other legislation.  The legislative body of a city may vote to place the question on the official ballot for any regular municipal election, or in the alternative, shall place the question on the official ballot for any regular municipal election upon submission to the legislative body of a petition signed by 5 percent of the registered voters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The selectmen or city council shall hold a public hearing on the question at least 15 days but not more than 30 days before the question is to be voted on.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the municipality and published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 7 days before the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A town or city may choose to restrict the use of the municipal transportation improvement fund to one or more of the transportation system modes provided for in paragraph VI(a).  Any such restriction shall be so stated in the wording of the question.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes,'' the additional motor vehicle registration fee shall apply within the town or city on the date set by the selectmen or the city council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e)(1) A town or city may consider rescinding its action in the manner described in subparagraph (c).  The wording of the question shall be the same as that was adopted by the town or city, except the word "adopt'' shall be changed to "rescind.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If a majority of those voting on the question vote "Yes,'' following the action taken to rescind, the additional motor vehicle registration fee shall not apply within the town or city.
