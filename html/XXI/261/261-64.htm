I. A resident owner of construction equipment, or a nonresident owner of such equipment who has a bona fide actual residence in a state granting like privileges to residents of this state shall not be required to register such equipment in this state if used at worksites and trailered from location to location or to cross highways to access contiguous property.  To register construction equipment, as defined under RSA 259:42, the fee shall be $25 except for the following rubber-tired equipment;  excavators, front end loaders, backhoes, graders, or construction equipment towed on a permanent trailer, such as a generator, which shall be assessed based on weight utilizing the following scale:  for equipment that weighs up to 7,500 lbs., the fee shall be $25;  for equipment from 7,501 lbs. to 15,000 lbs., the fee shall be $50;  for equipment from 15,001 lbs. to 50,000 lbs., the fee shall be $100;  for equipment from 50,001 lbs. to 80,000 lbs., the fee shall be $200;  and for all equipment over 80,000 lbs., the fee shall be $300.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Owners of implements of husbandry shall not be required to register such implements in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Implements of husbandry shall not be operated on toll roads or on the interstate and defense highway system.  When implements of husbandry not meeting the definition of a tractor in RSA 259:108 are moved over any other way, the power unit shall display in a conspicuous location an identifying decal or plate issued by the division.  The identifying decal or plate issued by the division is not a registration and shall not require the municipal permit for registration described in RSA 261:148.  The fee for each identifying decal or plate shall be $15 for an implement weighing no more than 15,000 pounds and $25 for an implement weighing 15,001 pounds or more.  The identifying decal or plate shall not require annual renewal but shall expire upon a change of ownership of the implement.  The director may adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A specifying the location for display of the identifying decal or plate, specifying such limitations as the director deems necessary for the safety of other highway users by restricting speeds of operation and operation after daylight hours, and specifying safety, conspicuity, and lighting equipment requirements.
