I. The director is hereby authorized to issue special conservation number plates, in lieu of other number plates.  The design of these special plates shall be determined as provided in RSA 261:97-d.  The plates shall retain the "live free or die'' logo.  Such plates shall be issued only upon application and upon payment of a $30 fee that shall be in addition to the regular motor vehicle registration fee and any other number plate fees otherwise required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner is also authorized to issue vanity conservation number plates.  The fee for any such vanity conservation number plate shall be the fee as provided in RSA 261:97-a, in addition to the fees for vanity plates which are otherwise established by law.  The vanity plate portion of the fee shall be distributed as provided in RSA 261:89 and RSA 263:52.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Plates shall be renewed on an annual basis for $30 per set.  Of this sum, the department shall retain an amount as is necessary to recover production and administrative costs as approved by the fiscal committee of the general court.  The remaining funds shall be paid to the state treasurer and distributed as provided in RSA 261:97-b.  The cost of replacement number plates shall be identical to the cost of initial number plates and the revenue from replacement number plates shall be distributed in the same manner as revenue derived from initial number plates.
