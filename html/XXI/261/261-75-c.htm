&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 261:75-c Special Registration Plate Symbol. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The director is hereby authorized to assign registration numbers that include a special registration plate symbol for the purpose of benefitting the state park system.  The special registration plate symbol shall serve as a character in the registration number.  A special registration plate symbol may be used on any type of number plate issued by the division for private passenger vehicles, recreational vehicles, and motorcycles.  The design and size of an appropriate symbol shall be determined by the commissioner in consultation with the commissioner of resources and economic development.  The department shall determine the means of identifying the special registration plate symbol in the computerized records of the department.  A special registration plate symbol shall be available to any applicant upon payment of a special registration plate symbol fee of $85, which shall be in addition to any other registration and number plate fees.  An applicant may include the symbol on any vanity number plate upon payment of the special registration plate symbol fee and the vanity plate service fee in RSA 261:89.  Vanity plate service fees shall be distributed as provided in RSA 261:89 and RSA 263:52.  The fees described in this section shall apply to original registrations and annual registration renewals.  The department shall retain from the special registration plate symbol fees an amount as is necessary to recover any additional production and administrative costs associated with use of the symbol.  The remaining funds shall be paid to the state treasurer and deposited in the state park fund established in RSA 216-A:3-i to fund maintenance and use of the park system and promotion of the special registration number program.  All other registration fees, permit fees, number plate fees, and special number plate fees shall be distributed as required by law.  The cost of replacement number plates shall be identical to the cost of initial number plates and the revenue from replacement number plates shall be distributed in the same manner as revenue derived from initial number plates.
