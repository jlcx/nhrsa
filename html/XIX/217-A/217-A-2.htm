&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 217-A:2 Findings and Declarations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Because there are no laws protecting any of our native plants, every year hundreds of our native plants are dug up and removed without permission from public and private property.  Many of these are taken out-of-state and sold for profit.  Therefore, the legislature finds and declares that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For human needs and enjoyment, the interests of science, and the economy of the state, native plants and natural communities throughout this state should be protected and conserved;  and that native plant numbers should be maintained and enhanced to insure their perpetuation as viable components of their ecosystems for the benefit of the people of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Native species of plants within this state and the nation that are endangered, threatened, or otherwise reduced in number or may become so because of loss, modification, or severe curtailment of their habitats, or because of exploitation for commercial, scientific, educational, or private use, should be accorded protection as is necessary to maintain and enhance their numbers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This state shall assist in the protection of species of plants that are determined to be endangered or threatened by prohibiting the taking, possession, transportation, processing, sale or offer for sale, exportation from this state, or shipment within this state of such species without required and valid federal and state permits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commercial sale of seeds, plants, and nursery stock is regulated by the New Hampshire department of agriculture, markets, and food under RSA 433.
