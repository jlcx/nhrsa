&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 216-H:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Under the impact of a steadily increasing population and the effects of the continuing development of land for residential and other purposes, few large tracts of forest land, particularly with a lake frontage, remain available in New Hampshire.  Laconia developmental services, located in the city of Laconia, with a shoreline of approximately 3,500 feet on Lake Winnisquam, is one such tract which is owned by the state and is deemed to be a natural resource that should be preserved for the enjoyment and benefit of the citizens of this state and the many tourists from other states and countries who visit here.  The general court therefore deems it to be a major asset and a significant benefit to the general public to retain this wonderful shoreline on the lake and approximately 200 acres, more or less, of the contiguous property immediately back from the shoreline of the lake, to be perpetually preserved as a state park for the generations to come.
