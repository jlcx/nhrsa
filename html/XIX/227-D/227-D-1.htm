&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-D:1 Declaration of Policy and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court declares that Mount Monadnock located in the towns of Dublin, Jaffrey, and Marlborough, Gap Mountain in Troy, and Little Monadnock Mountain in Fitzwilliam constitute a unique geographical attraction which brings thousands of visitors to the state each year and requires supervision and planning by the state of New Hampshire.  It has been established that there is a great need for the state to take jurisdiction over the lands of Mount Monadnock which are presently open to the public in order that these unique highlands can be preserved from the ravages of overuse.
