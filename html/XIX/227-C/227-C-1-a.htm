I. The general court has determined that the historical, archeological, architectural, engineering, and cultural heritage of New Hampshire is one of the most important environmental assets of the state and that the rapid social and economic development of contemporary society threatens the remaining vestiges of this heritage;  therefore, it is hereby declared to be public policy and in the public interest of this state to engage in a comprehensive program of historic preservation to promote the use and conservation of such property for the education, inspiration, pleasure, and enrichment of the citizens of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Unmarked human burials and human remains are subject to vandalism and inadvertent destruction at an ever-increasing rate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Existing state laws do not provide adequate protection to prevent damage to and destruction of these remains;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) There is a great deal of scientific information to be gained from the proper excavation, study, and analysis of human remains recovered from such burials;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) There has been no procedure for descendants or other interested individuals to make known their concerns regarding disposition of these remains.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Some purposes of this chapter are:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To provide adequate protection from vandalism for unmarked human burials and human remains;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To provide adequate protection for unmarked human burials and human remains not within the jurisdiction of the county medical examiner that are encountered during archaeological excavation, construction, or other ground disturbing activities, found anywhere within the state except on federal land;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To provide for adequate skeletal analysis of remains removed or excavated from unmarked human burials if the analysis would result in valuable scientific information.
