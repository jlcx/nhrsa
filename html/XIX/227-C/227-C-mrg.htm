<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court has determined that the historical, archeological, architectural, engineering, and cultural heritage of New Hampshire is one of the most important environmental assets of the state and that the rapid social and economic development of contemporary society threatens the remaining vestiges of this heritage;  therefore, it is hereby declared to be public policy and in the public interest of this state to engage in a comprehensive program of historic preservation to promote the use and conservation of such property for the education, inspiration, pleasure, and enrichment of the citizens of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Unmarked human burials and human remains are subject to vandalism and inadvertent destruction at an ever-increasing rate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Existing state laws do not provide adequate protection to prevent damage to and destruction of these remains;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) There is a great deal of scientific information to be gained from the proper excavation, study, and analysis of human remains recovered from such burials;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) There has been no procedure for descendants or other interested individuals to make known their concerns regarding disposition of these remains.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Some purposes of this chapter are:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To provide adequate protection from vandalism for unmarked human burials and human remains;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To provide adequate protection for unmarked human burials and human remains not within the jurisdiction of the county medical examiner that are encountered during archaeological excavation, construction, or other ground disturbing activities, found anywhere within the state except on federal land;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To provide for adequate skeletal analysis of remains removed or excavated from unmarked human burials if the analysis would result in valuable scientific information.

If the unmarked human burials or human remains are encountered as a result of construction or agricultural activities, disturbance of the remains shall cease immediately and shall not resume without authorization from either the county medical examiner or the state archaeologist, as provided in RSA 227-C:8-b, III or IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) If the unmarked human burials or human remains are encountered by a professional archaeologist, as a result of survey or test excavations, the remains may be excavated and other activities may resume after notification, by telephone or certified letter, is provided to the state archaeologist, and immediate notification is given to living descendants or specific groups known to have affinity with the remains.  The treatment, analysis, and disposition of the remains shall be as provided in RSA 227-C:8-c and 8-g.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a professional archaeologist directing long-term systematic archaeological research, that is, research designed to continue for one or more field seasons of 4 or more weeks' duration, sponsored by any accredited institution, accredited college or university with research interests in New Hampshire, as a part of his research, recovers Native American remains, he may be exempted from the provisions of RSA 227-C:8-b through 8-f and 8-g, III so long as he:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Upon completion of the project fieldwork, the professional archaeologist, in consultation with the skeletal analyst and the state archaeologist, shall determine the schedule for the completion of the skeletal analysis.  In the event of a disagreement, the time for completion of the skeletal analysis shall not exceed 4 years.  The director or his designee, after consultation with the state archaeologist, shall have authority concerning the ultimate disposition of the Native American remains after analysis is completed in accordance with RSA 227-C:8-g, I and 8-h, II and III.
<br>

<center><h2>Historic Agricultural Structure Matching Grants Program</h2></center>

<center><h3>Section 227-C:27</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 227-C:27 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Historic barns and agricultural structures symbolize the distinctive New Hampshire values of heritage, hard work, productivity, and stewardship.  They are witnesses to the role of agriculture in our state's image and its economy, and they serve as scenic landmarks for residents and visitors alike.  They are among our most highly valued heritage resources, but many can no longer generate sufficient income to prevent their loss by decay or demolition.  In order to assist the owners who are making an effort to preserve these irreplaceable assets, it is hereby declared to be public policy and in the public interest of this state to establish a matching grants program consisting of funds from private and public sector grants, gifts, and donations for preserving historic agricultural structures in New Hampshire.
