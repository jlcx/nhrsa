&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 216-F:3 Powers of Commissioner. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon recommendation of the commissioner, the governor and council may grant temporary or permanent rights of way across lands acquired under this chapter under such terms and conditions as may be advisable.  The commissioner may enter into cooperative agreements with agencies of the federal government or with private organizations to provide for the maintenance of the trail system.  No person who has granted a right of way for a trail across his land, or his successor in title, shall be liable to any user of the trail for injuries, suffered on said portion of the trail unless the same are caused by the wilful or wanton misconduct of the grantor or such successor in title, as the case may be.
