<codesect>
Whenever the state acquires any real property in a town or city for public recreational or park purposes the state shall annually pay to the town or city where such property is situate a sum equal to the taxes which would have been assessed against such property had such property remained taxable, basing such payments upon the assessed value of the property for the year prior to the year of acquisition at the current local rate of taxation applicable for the year in which payment is made, until and including the year the property is opened to the public for recreational or park use.  The year following the opening of the property for recreational or park use and for the second, third, fourth and fifth years following such opening the payments shall be based on 80, 60, 40 and 20 percent respectively of the assessed value of the property for the year prior to the year of acquisition at the current local rate of taxation applicable for the year in which payment is made and thereafter such payments shall cease.  If less than all the real property included in a single assessment is acquired by the state the commissioner of revenue administration shall determine the apportionment of the assessment between the state and the former owner.  At the time of computing the rate percent of taxation for the town or city where said real property is situate, the commissioner of revenue administration shall certify to the state treasurer the amount of the payment to be made to each town and city in each year and the treasurer shall make such payment on or before December 1.  The director of the division of parks and recreation shall notify the commissioner of revenue administration of the date when any real property acquired for recreational or park use is opened to the public.

The fees approved by the commissioner, after prior approval of the fiscal committee, shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 541-A, so as to provide the department with the ability to maximize revenues and to adjust fees according to market conditions and trends as is the common practice in private industry.

Said fees shall be consistent with the following criteria:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Fees for the use of park areas shall be designed to recover a reasonable portion of budget expenses consistent with the purposes of RSA 216-A:1 and 216-A:3.  The general court does not intend that all park facilities be self-supporting.

II. Fees for the use of campgrounds and ski lifts shall be comparable with the fees for use of similar privately owned facilities.

Special number plates issued to disabled veterans pursuant to RSA 261:86 or a letter issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs certifying that the veteran suffers from a service-connected disability shall constitute satisfactory proof under this section.  Any fees for the use of enterprise activities as defined in paragraph II shall be charged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Upon presentation of military identification, any active member of the armed forces who meets the minimum requirements for satisfactory membership, as defined in federal regulations, shall not be charged a fee for admission to day-use areas of the state park system.  In this section, "armed forces'' means armed forces as defined in RSA 21:50, II and includes active and reserve members of the New Hampshire national guard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any New Hampshire national guard member who retired in pay grade E6 or below shall not be charged a fee for day-use admission to the state park system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any fees for the use of enterprise activities as described in paragraph II of this section shall be charged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No admission fee shall be charged for day use of the state park system to the occupants of a vehicle with a number plate bearing a special registration plate symbol authorized by RSA 261:75-c.  Any fees for:  (a) enterprise activities as defined in paragraph II, (b) metered parking after June 15 and before September 16, (c) metered parking on weekends and holidays on or before June 15 and on or after September 16, (d) more than 6 consecutive hours of metered parking, or (e) metered parking for residential use or business employee use, shall be charged to occupants of such vehicles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) The commissioner shall periodically review all fees paid for entrance into and use of state parks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner may immediately begin to accept donations for the use and maintenance of Jericho Mountain state park and shall require fees for the entrance into and use of Jericho Mountain state park beginning on or before January 1, 2011.  All fees generated by Jericho Mountain state park shall be deposited into the state park fund established in RSA 216-A:3-i.  Such fees shall be based on revenue projected in the master plan and shall be in addition to registration fees for vehicles, all terrain vehicles as defined in RSA 215-A:1, I-b, and off highway recreational vehicles as defined in RSA 215-A:1, VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The commissioner may adopt parking fees or charges within the state park system that assess an increased rate for parking on holidays and weekend days with high traffic rates unless such plan for parking fees and charges is denied by the fiscal committee of the general court as provided by this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 216-A:7 Conservation Corps Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The director of the division of parks and recreation, in cooperation with the commissioner of the department of health and human services, shall establish a conservation corps for the purpose of employing New Hampshire youth with an emphasis on employing young people who need educational and vocational assistance to perform successfully in school, in their communities, and in their personal lives.  The services of these young people shall be used to create a hiking trail extending the length of the state or such other resource management and conservation projects deemed appropriate and necessary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 216-A:8 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The conservation corps program is designed to increase the sense of involvement and ownership by the participants in their state and to give them an opportunity to contribute something of lasting value to the state, by creating a new recreational resource for the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court finds that because of the impact of a steadily growing population, the continuing development of land for residential, commercial and other purposes, and the loss of shorelands for various purposes, fewer opportunities exist for the citizens of New Hampshire and visitors from other states to enjoy recreational activities in natural areas in this state.  Therefore, to fill a major gap in the state's existing trail system it shall be the policy of the state of New Hampshire to create, foster, maintain and promote a recreational trail generally following the Connecticut, Pemigewasset, and Merrimack rivers from the Canadian border to the Massachusetts border.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If, in the judgment of the advisory committee established in RSA 216-F:5, temporary segments, alternate segments, or feeder segments of trail are identified that would enhance the development of the New Hampshire Heritage Trail, such segments shall be eligible for participation in all of the provisions of this subdivision.
