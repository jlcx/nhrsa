The director shall submit copies of the plan to the governor, the governor's council, the presiding officers of the general court, the chairperson of the house resources, recreation and development committee, and the chairperson of the senate energy, environment, and economic development committee.  On or before June 1, 2009, the director of parks and recreation shall submit a progress report to the chairperson of the house resources, recreation and economic development committee and the chairperson of the senate energy, environment, and economic development committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The strategic plan shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An evaluation of overall state park system operations to identify strengths, weaknesses, and future approaches to increase revenue and simplify operations.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(e) Identification of areas in which there is a need for physical expansion of park properties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Identification of park system properties which are surplus to the state's needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A continual overview of marketing approaches and reservation systems to maximize day rental usage of the state park system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) The adoption of uniform standards for managing facility day use including uniformity in fee structure, reservation procedures, and monitoring of use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) An analysis of whether leasing or outsourcing certain state park functions, or entering into public/private partnerships would increase revenues and simplify operations.
