I. The conservation corps program is designed to increase the sense of involvement and ownership by the participants in their state and to give them an opportunity to contribute something of lasting value to the state, by creating a new recreational resource for the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court finds that because of the impact of a steadily growing population, the continuing development of land for residential, commercial and other purposes, and the loss of shorelands for various purposes, fewer opportunities exist for the citizens of New Hampshire and visitors from other states to enjoy recreational activities in natural areas in this state.  Therefore, to fill a major gap in the state's existing trail system it shall be the policy of the state of New Hampshire to create, foster, maintain and promote a recreational trail generally following the Connecticut, Pemigewasset, and Merrimack rivers from the Canadian border to the Massachusetts border.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If, in the judgment of the advisory committee established in RSA 216-F:5, temporary segments, alternate segments, or feeder segments of trail are identified that would enhance the development of the New Hampshire Heritage Trail, such segments shall be eligible for participation in all of the provisions of this subdivision.
