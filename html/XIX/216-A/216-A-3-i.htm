&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state treasurer shall establish a separate and distinct account to be known as the state park fund.  The treasurer shall establish within the state park fund separate and distinct accounts, known as the state park account and the state-owned ski area account.  The accounts shall be continuing and nonlapsing.  The treasurer shall deposit in the state park account actual revenues from fees, services, accommodations, rentals, retail sales, net profit from concession operations, and special registration plate symbol fees collected under RSA 261:75-c in excess of budget expenses and excluding revenues associated with state-owned ski areas.  The treasurer shall deposit in the state-owned ski area account actual revenues associated with the state-owned ski areas, derived by the department of resources and economic development from fees, services, accommodations, rentals, revenue from lift and tramway operations, retail sales, and net profit from concession operations in excess of budget expenses.  Any federal moneys which become available and all donations and gifts shall be deposited into their appropriately designated accounts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any funds deposited into the state park account and state-owned ski account are hereby continually appropriated to and may be expended by the commissioner of the department of resources and economic development only with the prior approval of the governor and council and the fiscal committee of the general court, provided that additional funds above those authorized in the budget are necessary for the division of parks and recreation to provide an adequate level of service and maintenance in the state park system, to restore park facilities, and for proper operation of the state-owned ski areas.  The commissioner may use funds in the park account to promote the special registration plate symbol program authorized by RSA 261:75-c.
