&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 225-A:25 Insurance;  Limitations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless an operator of a passenger tramway is in violation of this chapter or the rules of the board, which violation is causal of the injury complained of, no action shall lie against any operator by any passenger or his or her representative;  this prohibition shall not, however, prevent the maintenance of an action against an operator for negligent operation, construction, or maintenance of the passenger tramway itself.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as limited by paragraph III, each operator of a passenger tramway shall maintain liability insurance with limits of not less than $300,000 per accident.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The requirements of paragraph II shall not apply to an operator of a passenger tramway which is not open to the general public and operated without charge to users.  Nonprofit ski clubs, outing clubs, or other similar organizations, which are operators of rope or wire rope tows shall also be excepted from the requirements of paragraph II if the organization's bylaws so provide, each member of the organization is provided with a copy of such bylaws, and use of the rope or wire rope tows operated by the organization is restricted to members of that organization.  This paragraph shall not relieve the state or any political subdivision operating a rope or wire rope tow from the requirement of maintaining liability insurance in accordance with paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No action shall be maintained against any operator for injuries to any skier or passenger unless the same is commenced within 2 years from the time of injury provided, however, that as a condition precedent thereof the operator shall be notified by certified return receipt mail within 90 days of said injury.  The venue of any action against an operator shall be in the county where the ski area is located and not otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No ski area operator shall be held responsible for ensuring the safety of, or for damages including injury or death resulting to, skiers or other persons who utilize the facilities of a ski area to access terrain outside open and designated ski trails.  Ski areas shall not be liable for damages, including injury or death, to persons who venture beyond such open and designated ski trails.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A ski area operator owes no duty to anyone who trespasses on the ski area property.
