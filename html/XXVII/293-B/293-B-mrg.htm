<center><h3>Section 293-B:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-B:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court finds that the revitalization of the state's economy and the development of business and investment in New Hampshire will be facilitated by making available a broad range of entities for investment enterprises.  The statutory recognition of investment trusts, previously recognized only in common law, provides an alternative to conducting investment activity through entities such as corporations and partnerships and will introduce certainty as to treatment of investment trusts under state law, particularly with respect to the rights and duties of their trustees and beneficiaries.  It is the intent of the general court to give the constituent members of investment trusts the widest discretion to fashion structures of such entities to meet their investment needs consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-B:4 Contributions by Beneficial Owners. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A contribution of a beneficial owner to the New Hampshire investment trust may be in cash, property, or services rendered, or a promissory note or other obligation to contribute cash or property or to perform services;  provided however, that a person may become a beneficial owner of a New Hampshire investment trust and may receive a beneficial interest in a New Hampshire investment trust without making a contribution or being obligated to make a contribution to the New Hampshire investment trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust, a beneficial owner is obligated to the New Hampshire investment trust to perform any promise to contribute cash or property or to perform services, even if the beneficial owner is unable to perform because of death, disability, or any other reason.  If a beneficial owner does not make the required contribution of property or services, the beneficial owner is obligated at the option of the New Hampshire investment trust to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value (as stated in the records of the New Hampshire investment trust) of the contribution that has not been made.  The foregoing option shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the New Hampshire investment trust may have against such beneficial owner under the governing instrument of applicable law.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-B:6 Legal Proceedings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A New Hampshire investment trust may sue and be sued, and service of process upon one of the trustees shall be sufficient.  In furtherance of the foregoing, a New Hampshire investment trust may be sued for debts and other obligations or liabilities contracted or incurred by the trustees, or by the duly authorized agents of such trustees, in the performance of their respective duties under the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust, and for any damages to persons or property resulting from the negligence of such trustees or agents acting in the performance of such respective duties.  The property of a New Hampshire investment trust shall be subject to attachment and execution as if it were a corporation, in accordance with the relevant provisions of New Hampshire law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I, if the governing instrument of a New Hampshire investment trust which is a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. section 80a-1 et seq.), or which is otherwise excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(3), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. section 80a-1 et seq.), creates one or more series as provided in RSA 293-B:8, II(d), and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any such series and the assets associated with any such series are held in such separate and distinct records (directly or indirectly, including through a nominee or otherwise) and accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the New Hampshire investment trust, or any other series thereof, and if the governing instrument so provides, and notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this sentence is set forth in the certificate of trust of the New Hampshire investment trust, then the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series shall be enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the New Hampshire investment trust generally or any other series thereof, and, unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to the New Hampshire investment trust generally or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A trustee of a New Hampshire investment trust may be served with process in the manner prescribed in paragraph IV of this section in all civil actions or proceedings brought in this state involving or relating to the activities of the New Hampshire investment trust or a violation by a trustee of a duty to the New Hampshire investment trust, or any beneficial owner, whether or not the trustee is a trustee at the time suit is commenced.  Every resident or nonresident of this state who accepts election or appointment or serves as a trustee of a New Hampshire investment trust shall, by such acceptance or service, be deemed thereby to have consented to the appointment of the New Hampshire trustee or registered agent of such New Hampshire investment trust required by RSA 293-B:9 as such person's agent upon whom service of process may be made as provided in this paragraph.  Such acceptance or service shall signify the consent of such trustee that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such trustee within this state and such appointment of such New Hampshire trustee or registered agent shall be irrevocable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Service of process shall be effected by serving the New Hampshire trustee or registered agent of such New Hampshire investment trust required by RSA 293-B:9 with one copy of such process in the manner provided by law for service of writs of summons.  In addition, the clerk of the court in which the civil action or proceeding is pending shall, within 7 days of such service, deposit in the United States mails, by registered mail, postage prepaid, true and attested copies of the process, together with a statement that service is being made pursuant to this section, addressed to the defendant at the defendant's address last known to and furnished by the party desiring to make such service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In any action in which any such trustee has been served with process as hereinafter provided, the time in which a defendant shall be required to appear and file a responsive pleading shall be computed from the date of mailing by the clerk of the court as provided in paragraph IV of this section;  provided however, the court in which such action has been commenced may order such continuance or continuances as may be necessary to afford such trustee reasonable opportunity to defend the action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust or other writing, a trustee or beneficial owner or other person may consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of this state, or the exclusivity of arbitration in a specified jurisdiction or this state, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust or other writing.  Except by agreeing to arbitrate any arbitrable matter in a specified jurisdiction or in this state, a beneficial owner who is not a trustee may not waive its right to maintain a legal action or proceeding in the courts of this state with respect to matters relating to the organization or internal affairs of a New Hampshire investment trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law.  This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The New Hampshire supreme court may make all necessary rules respecting the form of process, the manner of issuance and return thereof, and such other rules which may be necessary to implement this section and are not inconsistent with this section.  The courts of this state shall have jurisdiction over New Hampshire investment trusts to the same extent as they have jurisdiction over common law trusts formed under the laws of this state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every New Hampshire investment trust shall at all times have at least one trustee which may either be a natural person or a bank, and in the case of a natural person shall be a person who is a resident of this state.  As long as this requirement is satisfied, any additional trustee need not be a bank or natural person who is a resident of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, if a New Hampshire investment trust is or becomes a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, (15 U.S.C. section 80a-1 et seq.), as amended, such New Hampshire investment trust shall not be required to have a trustee who is a resident of this state or a bank if and for so long as such New Hampshire investment trust shall be in compliance with paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each New Hampshire investment trust shall have and maintain in this state:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A registered office, which may but need not be a place of business in this state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A registered agent for service of process on the New Hampshire investment trust, which agent may be either an individual resident of this state or a business entity authorized to do business in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A New Hampshire investment trust may change the location of its registered office in this state to any other place in this state, or may change the registered agent to any other individual resident of this state or business entity having its principal place of business in this state, by delivering for filing an amendment to its certificate of trust to the secretary of state in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.  If a New Hampshire investment trust which is an investment company registered as aforesaid maintains a registered office and registered agent in this state as herein provided, then the reference in RSA 293-B:12, I(b) to the "name and the business address of each of the trustees'' shall be deemed a reference to the name and the business address of the registered agent and registered office maintained under this section, and the certificate of trust filed under RSA 293-B:12 shall reflect such information in lieu of the information otherwise required by RSA 293-B:12, I(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Service of process upon a registered agent maintained by a New Hampshire investment trust pursuant to paragraph III of this section shall be as effective as if served upon one of the trustees of the New Hampshire investment trust pursuant to RSA 293-B:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A trustee or registered agent of a New Hampshire investment trust whose address, as set forth in a certificate of trust pursuant to RSA 293-B:12, I(b), has changed may change such address in the certificates of trust of all New Hampshire investment trusts for which such trustee or registered agent is appointed to another address in the state by paying a fee as set forth in RSA 293-B:15 and filing with the secretary of state a certificate, executed by such trustee or registered agent, setting forth the address of such trustee or registered agent before it was changed, and further certifying as to the new address of such trustee or registered agent for each of the New Hampshire investment trusts for which it is trustee or registered agent.  Upon the filing of such certificate, the secretary of state shall furnish to the trustee or registered agent a certified copy of the same under the secretary's hand and seal of office, and thereafter, or until further change of address, as authorized by law, the address of such trustee or registered agent in this state for each of the New Hampshire investment trusts for which it is trustee or registered agent shall be located at the new address of the trustee or registered agent thereof as given in the certificate.  A trustee or registered agent of a New Hampshire investment trust whose name, as set forth in a certificate of trust pursuant to RSA 293-B:12, I(b), has changed may change such name in the certificates of trust of all New Hampshire investment trusts for which such trustee or registered agent is appointed to its new name by paying a fee as set forth in RSA 293-B:15 and filing with the secretary of state a certificate, executed by such trustee or registered agent, setting forth the name of such trustee or registered agent before it was changed and further certifying as to the new name of such trustee or registered agent for each of the New Hampshire investment trusts for which it is a trustee or registered agent.  Upon the filing of such certificate and payment of such fee, the secretary of state shall furnish to the trustee or registered agent a certified copy of the certificate under the secretary's hand and seal of office.  A change of name of any person acting as a trustee or registered agent of a New Hampshire investment trust as a result of a merger or consolidation of the trustee or registered agent with another person who succeeds to its assets and liabilities by operation of law shall be deemed a change of name for purposes of this section.  Filing a certificate under this section shall be deemed to be an amendment of the certificate of trust of each New Hampshire investment trust affected thereby, and no further action with respect thereto to amend its certificate of trust under RSA 293-B:12 shall be required.  Any trustee or registered agent filing a certificate under this section shall promptly, upon such filing, deliver a copy of any such certificate to each New Hampshire investment trust affected thereby.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-B:18 Merger and Consolidation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, a New Hampshire investment trust may merge or consolidate with or into one or more New Hampshire investment trusts or other investment entities formed or organized or existing under the laws of any other state or the United States or any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction, with such New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity as the agreement shall provide being the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity.  Unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument of a New Hampshire investment trust, a merger or consolidation shall be approved by each New Hampshire investment trust which is to merge or consolidate by all of the trustees and the beneficial owners of such New Hampshire investment trust.  In connection with a merger or consolidation hereunder, rights or securities of, or interests in, a New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity which is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity or, in addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interest in, a New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity which is not the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity in the merger or consolidation or may be cancelled.  Notwithstanding prior approval, an agreement of merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a provision for such termination or amendment contained in the agreement of merger or consolidation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a New Hampshire investment trust is merging or consolidating under this section, the New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity surviving or resulting in or from the merger or consolidation shall deliver one original and one exact copy of a certificate of merger or consolidation to the secretary of state.  The certificate of merger or consolidation shall state:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of each of the New Hampshire investment trusts or other investment entities which is to merge or consolidate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That an agreement of merger or consolidation has been approved and executed by each of the New Hampshire investment trusts or other investment entities which is to merge or consolidate;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The name of the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In the case of a merger in which a New Hampshire investment trust is the surviving entity, such amendments, if any, to the certificate of trust of the surviving New Hampshire investment trust to change its name as are desired to be effected by the merger;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The future effective date or time, which shall be a date or time certain, of the merger or consolidation if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger or consolidation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) That the executed agreement of merger or consolidation is on file at the principal place of business of the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity, and shall state the address thereof;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) That a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be furnished by the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity, on request and without cost, to any beneficial owner of any New Hampshire investment trust or any person holding an interest in any other investment entity which is to merge or consolidate;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) If the surviving or resulting entity is not a New Hampshire investment trust, a statement that such surviving or resulting other investment entity agrees that it may be served with process in the state of New Hampshire in any action, suit, or proceeding for the enforcement of any obligation of any New Hampshire investment trust which is to merge or consolidate, irrevocably appointing the secretary of state as its agent to accept service of process in any such action, suit, or proceeding and specifying the address to which a copy of such process shall be mailed to it by the secretary of state.  In the event of service under this subparagraph upon the secretary of state, the plaintiff in any such action, suit, or proceeding shall furnish the secretary of state with the address specified in the certificate of merger or consolidation provided for in this section and any other address which the plaintiff may elect to furnish, together with copies of such process as required by the secretary of state, and the secretary of state shall notify such surviving or resulting other investment entity thereof at all such addresses furnished by the plaintiff by letter, certified mail, return receipt requested.  Such letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served upon the secretary of state.  It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to notify the secretary of state that service is being made pursuant to this subparagraph, and to pay the secretary of state the sum of $50 for use of the state of New Hampshire, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding, if the plaintiff shall prevail therein.  The secretary of state shall maintain an alphabetical record of any such process setting forth the names of the plaintiff and defendant, the title, docket number, and nature of the proceedings in which process has been served upon him or her, the return date thereof, and the day and hour when the service was made.  The secretary of state shall not be required to retain such information for a period longer than 5 years from his or her receipt of the service of process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any failure to file a certificate of merger or consolidation in connection with a merger or consolidation which was effective prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of any such merger or consolidation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless a future effective date or time is provided in a certificate of merger or consolidation, in which event a merger or consolidation shall be effective at any such future effective date or time, a merger or consolidation shall be effective upon the filing in the office of the secretary of state of a certificate of merger or consolidation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate of cancellation for a New Hampshire investment trust which is not the surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation.  A certificate of merger that sets forth any amendment in accordance with subparagraph II(d) of this section shall be deemed to be an amendment to the certificate of trust of the New Hampshire investment trust, and the New Hampshire investment trust shall not be required to take any further action to amend its certificate of trust under RSA 293-B:12 with respect to such amendments set forth in the certificate of merger.  Whenever this section requires the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation, such requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the filing of an agreement of merger or consolidation containing the information required by this section to be set forth in the certificate of merger or consolidation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the governing instrument of a New Hampshire investment trust, a governing instrument of a New Hampshire investment trust containing a specific reference to this paragraph may provide that an agreement of merger or consolidation approved in accordance with paragraph I may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Effect any amendment to the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Effect the adoption of a new governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust if it is the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust in the merger or consolidation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any amendment to the governing instrument of a New Hampshire investment trust or adoption of a new governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust made pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or consolidation.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a merger or consolidation or of any of the matters referred to herein by any other means provided for in the governing instrument of a New Hampshire investment trust or other agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the governing instrument of any constituent New Hampshire investment trust to the merger or consolidation, including a New Hampshire investment trust formed for the purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the governing instrument of the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of New Hampshire, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the New Hampshire investment trusts and other investment entities that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due to any of said New Hampshire investment trusts and other investment entities, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such New Hampshire investment trusts and other investment entities, shall have vested in the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity as they were of each of the New Hampshire investment trusts and other investment entities that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the state of New Hampshire, in any of such New Hampshire investment trusts and other investment entities, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter;  but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of said New Hampshire investment trusts and other investment entities shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of each of the said New Hampshire investment trusts and other investment entities that have merged or consolidated shall thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting New Hampshire investment trust or other investment entity, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities, and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A governing instrument or an agreement of merger or consolidation may provide that contractual appraisal rights with respect to a beneficial interest or another interest in a New Hampshire investment trust shall be available for any class or group of beneficial owners or beneficial interests in connection with any amendment of a governing instrument, any merger or consolidation in which the New Hampshire investment trust is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of the New Hampshire investment trust's assets.  The New Hampshire courts shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter relating to any such appraisal rights.

VII. When a New Hampshire investment trust has transferred or domesticated out of the state of New Hampshire pursuant to this section, the transferred or domesticated other business entity shall, for all purposes of the laws of the state of New Hampshire, be deemed to be the same entity as the New Hampshire investment trust.  When any transfer or domestication of a New Hampshire investment trust out of the state of New Hampshire shall have become effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of New Hampshire, all of the rights, privileges, and powers of the New Hampshire investment trust that has transferred or domesticated, and all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due to such New Hampshire investment trust, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to such New Hampshire investment trust, shall remain vested in the transferred or domesticated other business entity and shall be the property of such transferred or domesticated other business entity, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in such New Hampshire investment trust shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter;  but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of such New Hampshire investment trust shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the New Hampshire investment trust that has transferred or domesticated shall remain attached to the transferred or domesticated other business entity, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities, and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it in its capacity as the transferred or domesticated other business entity.  The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the New Hampshire investment trust that has transferred or domesticated, as well as the debts, liabilities, and duties of such New Hampshire investment trust, shall not be deemed, as a consequence of the transfer or domestication out of the state of New Hampshire, to have been transferred to the transferred or domesticated other business entity for any purpose of the laws of the state of New Hampshire, provided that this sentence shall not limit any of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.
