Such letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served upon the secretary of state.  It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to notify the secretary of state that service is being made pursuant to this paragraph, and to pay to the secretary of state the sum of $50 for the use of this state, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding, if the plaintiff shall prevail therein.

The secretary of state shall not be required to retain such information for a period longer than 5 years from receipt of the service of process.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. Upon the filing to the secretary of state of the certificate of conversion to a non-New Hampshire entity or upon the future effective date or time of the certificate of conversion to a non-New Hampshire entity and payment to the secretary of state of all fees prescribed in this chapter, the secretary of state shall certify that the New Hampshire investment trust has filed all documents and paid all fees required by this chapter, and thereupon the New Hampshire investment trust shall cease to exist as a New Hampshire investment trust.  Such certificate of the secretary of state shall be prima facie evidence of the conversion by such New Hampshire investment trust out of the state of New Hampshire.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. The conversion of a New Hampshire investment trust out of the state of New Hampshire in accordance with this section and the resulting cessation of its existence as a New Hampshire investment trust pursuant to a certificate of conversion to a non-New Hampshire entity shall not be deemed to affect any obligations or liabilities of the New Hampshire investment trust incurred prior to such conversion or the personal liability of any person incurred prior to such conversion, nor shall it be deemed to affect the choice of law applicable to the New Hampshire investment trust with respect to matters arising prior to such conversion.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. When a New Hampshire investment trust has been converted to an other business entity pursuant to this section, the other business entity shall, for all purposes of the laws of the state of New Hampshire, be deemed to be the same entity as the New Hampshire investment trust.

The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the New Hampshire investment trust that has converted, as well as the debts, liabilities, and duties of such New Hampshire investment trust, shall not be deemed, as a consequence of the conversion, to have been transferred to the other business entity to which such New Hampshire investment trust has converted for any purpose of the laws of the state of New Hampshire, provided that this sentence shall not limit any of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.">
