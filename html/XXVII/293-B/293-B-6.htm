<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI. A New Hampshire investment trust may sue and be sued, and service of process upon one of the trustees shall be sufficient.  In furtherance of the foregoing, a New Hampshire investment trust may be sued for debts and other obligations or liabilities contracted or incurred by the trustees, or by the duly authorized agents of such trustees, in the performance of their respective duties under the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust, and for any damages to persons or property resulting from the negligence of such trustees or agents acting in the performance of such respective duties.  The property of a New Hampshire investment trust shall be subject to attachment and execution as if it were a corporation, in accordance with the relevant provisions of New Hampshire law.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Notwithstanding paragraph I, if the governing instrument of a New Hampshire investment trust which is a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. section 80a-1 et seq.), or which is otherwise excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(3), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. section 80a-1 et seq.), creates one or more series as provided in RSA 293-B:8, II(d), and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any such series and the assets associated with any such series are held in such separate and distinct records (directly or indirectly, including through a nominee or otherwise) and accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the New Hampshire investment trust, or any other series thereof, and if the governing instrument so provides, and notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this sentence is set forth in the certificate of trust of the New Hampshire investment trust, then the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series shall be enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the New Hampshire investment trust generally or any other series thereof, and, unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to the New Hampshire investment trust generally or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. A trustee of a New Hampshire investment trust may be served with process in the manner prescribed in paragraph IV of this section in all civil actions or proceedings brought in this state involving or relating to the activities of the New Hampshire investment trust or a violation by a trustee of a duty to the New Hampshire investment trust, or any beneficial owner, whether or not the trustee is a trustee at the time suit is commenced.  Every resident or nonresident of this state who accepts election or appointment or serves as a trustee of a New Hampshire investment trust shall, by such acceptance or service, be deemed thereby to have consented to the appointment of the New Hampshire trustee or registered agent of such New Hampshire investment trust required by RSA 293-B:9 as such person's agent upon whom service of process may be made as provided in this paragraph.  Such acceptance or service shall signify the consent of such trustee that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such trustee within this state and such appointment of such New Hampshire trustee or registered agent shall be irrevocable.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. Service of process shall be effected by serving the New Hampshire trustee or registered agent of such New Hampshire investment trust required by RSA 293-B:9 with one copy of such process in the manner provided by law for service of writs of summons.  In addition, the clerk of the court in which the civil action or proceeding is pending shall, within 7 days of such service, deposit in the United States mails, by registered mail, postage prepaid, true and attested copies of the process, together with a statement that service is being made pursuant to this section, addressed to the defendant at the defendant's address last known to and furnished by the party desiring to make such service.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. In any action in which any such trustee has been served with process as hereinafter provided, the time in which a defendant shall be required to appear and file a responsive pleading shall be computed from the date of mailing by the clerk of the court as provided in paragraph IV of this section;  provided however, the court in which such action has been commenced may order such continuance or continuances as may be necessary to afford such trustee reasonable opportunity to defend the action.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. In the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust or other writing, a trustee or beneficial owner or other person may consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of this state, or the exclusivity of arbitration in a specified jurisdiction or this state, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust or other writing.  Except by agreeing to arbitrate any arbitrable matter in a specified jurisdiction or in this state, a beneficial owner who is not a trustee may not waive its right to maintain a legal action or proceeding in the courts of this state with respect to matters relating to the organization or internal affairs of a New Hampshire investment trust.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law.  This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. The New Hampshire supreme court may make all necessary rules respecting the form of process, the manner of issuance and return thereof, and such other rules which may be necessary to implement this section and are not inconsistent with this section.
