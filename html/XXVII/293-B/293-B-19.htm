&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-B:19 Derivative Actions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A beneficial owner may bring an action in the right of a New Hampshire investment trust in the same state court of New Hampshire as derivative proceedings with respect to corporations under RSA 293-A:7.40 through RSA 293-A:7.47 to recover a judgment in its favor if trustees with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those trustees to bring the action is not likely to succeed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In a derivative action, the plaintiff shall be a beneficial owner at the time of bringing the action:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At the time of the transaction of which he or she complains;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) His or her status as a beneficial owner had devolved upon him or her by operation of law or pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument of the New Hampshire investment trust from a person who was a beneficial owner at the time of the transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In a derivative action, the complaint shall set forth with particularity the effort, if any, of the plaintiff to secure initiation of the action by the trustees, or the reasons for not making the effort.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a derivative action is successful, in whole or in part, or if anything is received by a New Hampshire investment trust as a result of a judgment, compromise, or settlement of any such action, the court may award the plaintiff reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees.  If anything is so received by the plaintiff, the court shall make such award of plaintiff's expenses payable out of those proceeds and direct plaintiff to remit to the New Hampshire investment trust the remainder thereof, and if those proceeds are insufficient to reimburse plaintiff's reasonable expenses, the court may direct that any such award of plaintiff's expenses or a portion thereof be paid by the New Hampshire investment trust.
