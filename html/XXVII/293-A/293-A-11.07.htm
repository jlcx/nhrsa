<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the separate existence of every corporation or eligible entity that is merged into the survivor ceases;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) all title to real estate and other property owned by, and every contract right possessed by, each corporation or eligible entity that merges into the survivor is vested in the survivor without reversion or impairment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) all liabilities of each corporation or eligible entity that is merged into the survivor are vested in the survivor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) the name of the survivor may, but need not be, substituted in any pending proceeding for the name of any party to the merger whose separate existence ceased in the merger;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) the articles of incorporation or organic documents of a survivor that is created by the merger become effective;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) the shares of each corporation that is a party to the merger, and the interests in an eligible entity that is a party to a merger, that are to be converted under the plan of merger into shares, eligible interests, obligations, rights to acquire securities, other securities, or eligible interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, are converted, and the former holders of such shares or eligible interests are entitled only to the rights provided to them in the plan of merger or to any rights they may have under RSA 293-A:13.01 through RSA 293-A:13.40 or the organic law of the eligible entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a share exchange becomes effective, the shares of each domestic corporation that are to be exchanged for shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares or other securities, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, are entitled only to the rights provided to them in the plan of share exchange or to any rights they may have under RSA 293-A:13.01 through RSA 293-A:13.40.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person who becomes subject to owner liability for some or all of the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any entity as a result of a merger or share exchange shall have owner liability only to the extent provided in the organic law of the entity and only for those debts, obligations, and liabilities that arise after the effective time of the articles of merger or share exchange.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The merger or share exchange does not discharge any owner liability under the organic law of the entity in which the person was a shareholder or interest holder to the extent any such owner liability arose before the effective time of the articles of merger or share exchange.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The person shall not have owner liability under the organic law of the entity in which the person was a shareholder or interest holder prior to the merger or share exchange for any debt, obligation, or liability that arises after the effective time of the articles of merger or share exchange.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The provisions of the organic law of any entity for which the person had owner liability before the merger or share exchange shall continue to apply to the collection or discharge of any owner liability preserved by subparagraph (1), as if the merger or share exchange had not occurred.
