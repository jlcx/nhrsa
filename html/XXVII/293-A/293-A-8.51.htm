<codesect>
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a corporation may indemnify an individual who is a party to a proceeding because the individual is a director against liability incurred in the proceeding if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1)(i) the director conducted himself or herself in good faith;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) reasonably believed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) in the case of conduct in an official capacity, that his or her conduct was in the best interests of the corporation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in all other cases, that the director's conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful;  or

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in connection with any proceeding with respect to conduct for which the director was adjudged liable on the basis of receiving a financial benefit to which he or she was not entitled, whether or not involving action in the director's official capacity.
