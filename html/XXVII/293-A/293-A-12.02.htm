<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For a transaction to be authorized:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The board of directors shall recommend the proposed transaction to the shareholders unless the board of directors determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its determination to the shareholders with the submission of the proposed transaction;  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The shareholders entitled to vote shall approve the transaction.

The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, the property of the corporation and contain or be accompanied by a description of the transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors, acting pursuant to subsection (c) require a greater vote or a vote by voting groups, the transaction to be authorized shall be approved by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) After a sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of property is authorized, the transaction may be abandoned, subject to any contractual rights, without further shareholder action.
