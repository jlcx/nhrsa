&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:14.21 Procedure for and Effect of Administrative Dissolution. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If the secretary of state determines that one or more grounds exist under RSA 293-A:14.20 for dissolving a corporation, the secretary of state shall administratively dissolve the corporation by mailing a notice of dissolution to the corporation at its principal address as listed in the records of the secretary of state.  Such notice shall recite the grounds for dissolution and effective date, together with an application for reinstatement and shall at the same time give notice to the department of revenue administration, but such notice shall not constitute written or published notice to claimants otherwise required under RSA 293-A:14.06 or RSA 293-A:14.07.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A corporation administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under RSA 293-A:14.05 and notify claimants under RSA 293-A:14.06 and 293-A:14.07.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The administrative dissolution of a corporation shall not terminate the authority of its registered agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The secretary of state shall not permit any other individual, corporation, or other business entity to assume the same name or a similar name, of a corporation administratively dissolved under this section, or any trade name registered by such corporation pursuant to RSA 349, for a period of 120 days following the notice of administrative dissolution without the written consent of such corporation.
