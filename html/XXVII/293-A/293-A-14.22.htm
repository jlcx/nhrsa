<codesect>
(a) A corporation administratively dissolved under RSA 293-A:14.21 may apply to the secretary of state for reinstatement within 3 years after the effective date of dissolution.  The application shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of its administrative dissolution;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) State that the ground or grounds for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) State that the corporation's name or proposed name satisfies the requirements of RSA 293-A:4.01;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Contain a certificate from the New Hampshire department of revenue administration in accordance with RSA 77-A:18, III, and RSA 77-E:12, III, if such application is received by the secretary of state more than 120 days after the notice of administrative dissolution is mailed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the secretary of state determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (a), that the information is correct, that the corporation name is available for registration, and that it is accompanied by the fee required in RSA 293-A:1.22(a)(7), the secretary of state shall cancel the notice of dissolution and prepare a notice of reinstatement that recites the determination and the effective date of reinstatement and mail said notice to the corporation.  If the application for reinstatement included a change of name of the corporation, said notice shall set forth the change of name of the corporation, and said notice shall constitute an amendment to the articles of incorporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred.
