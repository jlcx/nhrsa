&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:1.26 Appeal From Secretary of State's Refusal to File Document. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If the secretary of state refuses to file a document delivered for filing, the domestic or foreign corporation may appeal the refusal within 30 days after the return of the document to the superior court of the county where the corporation's principal office (or, if none in this state, its registered office) is or will be located.  The appeal is commenced by petitioning the court to compel filing the document and by attaching to the petition the document and the secretary of state's explanation of his or her refusal to file.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The court may summarily order the secretary of state to file the document or take other action the court considers appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings.
