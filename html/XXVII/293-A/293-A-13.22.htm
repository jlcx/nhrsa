&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:13.22 Appraisal Notice and Form. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) If a corporate action requiring appraisal rights under RSA 293-A:13.02(a) becomes effective, the corporation must send a written appraisal notice and the form required by RSA 293-A:13.02(b)(1) to all shareholders who satisfy the requirements of RSA 293-A:13.21(a) or RSA 293-A:13.21(b).  In the case of a merger under RSA 293-A:11.05, the parent must deliver an appraisal notice and form to all record shareholders who may be entitled to assert appraisal rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The appraisal notice must be delivered no earlier than the date the corporate action specified in RSA 293-A:13.02(a) became effective, and no later than 10 days after such date, and must:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) supply a form that (i) specifies the first date of any announcement to shareholders made prior to the date the corporate action became effective of the principal terms of the proposed corporate action, and (ii) if such announcement was made, requires the shareholder asserting appraisal rights to certify whether beneficial ownership of those shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before that date, and (iii) requires the shareholder asserting appraisal rights to certify that such shareholder did not vote for or consent to the transaction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) state:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) where the form must be sent and where certificates for certificated shares must be deposited and the date by which those certificates must be deposited, which date may not be earlier than the date for receiving the required form under RSA 293-A:13.22(b)(2)(ii);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) a date by which the corporation must receive the form, which date may not be fewer than 40 nor more than 60 days after the date the RSA 293-A:13.22(a) appraisal notice is sent, and state that the shareholder shall have waived the right to demand appraisal with respect to the shares unless the form is received by the corporation by such specified date;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) the corporation's estimate of the fair value of the shares;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) that, if requested in writing, the corporation will provide, to the shareholder so requesting, within 10 days after the date specified in RSA 293-A:13.22(b)(2)(ii) the number of shareholders who return the forms by the specified date and the total number of shares owned by them;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(v) the date by which the notice to withdraw under RSA 293-A:13.23 must be received, which date must be within 20 days after the date specified in RSA 293-A:13.22(b)(2)(ii);  and
<br>
