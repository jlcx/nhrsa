<codesect>
(a) A corporation shall notify shareholders of the date, time, and place of each annual and special shareholders' meeting no fewer than 10 nor more than 60 days before the meeting date.  The notice shall include the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different than the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting.  If the board of directors has authorized participation by means of remote communication pursuant to RSA 293-A:7.09 for any class or series of shareholders, the notice to such class or series of shareholders shall describe the means of remote communication to be used.  Unless this chapter or the articles of incorporation require otherwise, the corporation is required to give notice only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unless this chapter or the articles of incorporation require otherwise, notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

(d) If not otherwise fixed under RSA 293-A:7.03 or RSA 293-A:7.07 the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at an annual or special shareholders' meeting is the day before the first notice is delivered to shareholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Unless the bylaws require otherwise, if an annual or special shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if the new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment.  If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under RSA 293-A:7.07 however, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given under this section to shareholders entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.
