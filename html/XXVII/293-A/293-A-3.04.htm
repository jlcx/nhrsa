<codesect>
No act of a corporation and no conveyance or transfer of real or personal property to or by a corporation shall be invalid because the corporation was without capacity or power to do the act or to make or receive the conveyance or transfer, but the lack of capacity or power may be asserted:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In a proceeding by a shareholder against a corporation to enjoin the doing of any act or the transfer of real or personal property by or to the corporation.  If the unauthorized act or transfer sought to be enjoined is being, or is to be, performed or made under a contract to which the corporation is a party, the court may, if all of the parties to the contract are parties to the proceeding and if it deems the same to be equitable, set aside and enjoin the performance of the contract, and in so doing may allow to the corporation or to other parties to the contract, as the case may be, compensation for the loss or damage sustained by either of them which may result from the action of the court in setting aside and enjoining the performance of the contract.  Anticipated profits to be derived from the performance of the contract shall not be awarded by the court as a loss or damage sustained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In a proceeding by the corporation, whether acting directly or through a receiver, trustee, or other legal representative, or through shareholders in a representative suit, against the incumbent or former directors or officers of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In a proceeding by the attorney general, as provided in this chapter to dissolve the corporation, or in a proceeding by the attorney general to enjoin the corporation from the transaction of unauthorized business.
