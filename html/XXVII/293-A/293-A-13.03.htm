&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:13.03 Dissent by Nominees and Beneficial Owners. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A record shareholder may assert dissenters' rights as to fewer than all the shares registered in his name only if he dissents with respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one person and notifies the corporation in writing of the name and address of each person on whose behalf he asserts dissenters' rights.  The rights of a partial dissenter under this subsection are determined as if the shares as to which he dissents and his other shares were registered in the names of different shareholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A beneficial shareholder may assert dissenters' rights as to shares held on his behalf only if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) He submits to the corporation the record shareholder's written consent to the dissent not later than the time the beneficial shareholder asserts dissenters' rights;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) He does so with respect to all shares of which he is the beneficial shareholder or over which he has power to direct the vote.
