&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:11.09 Approval of Conversion of a Corporation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A corporation may convert to a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of New Hampshire upon the authorization of such conversion in accordance with this section and fulfillment of the requirements of RSA 304-C:149.  The board of directors of the corporation shall adopt a plan of conversion and shall submit the plan of conversion for approval of the shareholders in the manner provided for shareholder approval of a plan of merger under RSA 293-A:11.03 for a merger requiring shareholder approval.  After a plan of conversion is authorized and at any time before the certificate of conversion is filed, the planned conversion may be abandoned, subject to any contractual rights, without further shareholder action, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the plan of conversion, or if none is set forth, in the manner determined by the board of directors.  The term "corporation,'' as used in this section, shall include nondepository trust companies incorporated as banking corporations under the provisions of RSA 392 or RSA 392-A.  Such nondepository trust companies shall be entitled to employ the procedures provided in this section to voluntarily dissolve their trust company charters pursuant to RSA 392:43 through 392:47 and to reorganize as domestic business corporations subject to the provisions of this statute.
