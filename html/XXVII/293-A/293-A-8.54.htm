<codesect>
(a) A director who is a party to a proceeding because he or she is a director may apply for indemnification or an advance for expenses to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction.  After receipt of an application and after giving any notice it considers necessary, the court shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) order indemnification if the court determines that the director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under RSA 293-A:8.52;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification or advance for expenses pursuant to a provision authorized by RSA 293-A:8.58(a);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court determines, in view of all the relevant circumstances, that it is fair and reasonable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) to indemnify the director;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) to advance expenses to the director, even if he or she has not met the relevant standard of conduct set forth in RSA 293-A:8.51(a), failed to comply with RSA 293-A:8.53, or was adjudged liable in a proceeding referred to in RSA 293-A:8.51(e)(1) or (e)(2), but if the director was adjudged so liable indemnification shall be limited to expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification under subsection (a)(1) or to indemnification or advance for expenses under subsection (a)(2), it shall also order the corporation to pay the director's expenses incurred in connection with obtaining court-ordered indemnification or advance for expenses.  If the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification or advance for expenses under subsection (a)(3), it may also order the corporation to pay the director's expenses to obtain court-ordered indemnification or advance for expenses.
