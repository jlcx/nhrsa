&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:8.54 Court-Ordered Indemnification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Unless a corporation's articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director of the corporation who is a party to a proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction.  On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice the court considers necessary may order indemnification if it determines:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under RSA 293-A:8.52, in which case the court shall also order the corporation to pay the director's reasonable expenses incurred to obtain court-ordered indemnification;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not he met the standard of conduct set forth in RSA 293-A:8.51 or was adjudged liable as described in RSA 293-A:8.51(d), but if he was adjudged so liable his indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses incurred.
