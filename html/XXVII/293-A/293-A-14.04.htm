<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) After the revocation of dissolution is authorized, the corporation may revoke the dissolution by delivering to the secretary of state for filing articles of revocation of dissolution, together with a copy of its articles of dissolution, that set forth:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the date that the revocation of dissolution was authorized;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) if the corporation's board of directors (or incorporators) revoked the dissolution, a statement to that effect;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) if the corporation's board of directors revoked a dissolution authorized by the shareholders, a statement that revocation was permitted by action by the board of directors alone pursuant to that authorization;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) if shareholder action was required to revoke the dissolution, the information required by RSA 293-A:14.03(a)(3).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Revocation of dissolution is effective upon the effective date of the articles of revocation of dissolution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When the revocation of dissolution is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred.
