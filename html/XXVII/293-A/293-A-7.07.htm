<codesect>
(a) The bylaws may fix or provide the manner of fixing the record date for one or more voting groups in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote, or to take any other action.  If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board of directors of the corporation may fix a future date as the record date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A record date fixed under this section may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders' meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, it may provide that the original record date continues in effect or it may fix a new record date.
