<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The board of directors may fill the vacancy.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office.
<br>
