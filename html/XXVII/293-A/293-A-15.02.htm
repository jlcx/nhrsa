&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:15.02 Consequences of Transacting Business Without Authority. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A foreign corporation transacting business in this state without a certificate of authority may not maintain a proceeding in any court in this state until it obtains a certificate of authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The successor to a foreign corporation that transacted business in this state without a certificate of authority and the assignee of a cause of action arising out of that business may not maintain a proceeding based on that cause of action in any court in this state until the foreign corporation or its successor obtains a certificate of authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A court may stay a proceeding commenced by a foreign corporation, its successor, or assignee until it determines whether the foreign corporation or its successor requires a certificate of authority.  If it so determines, the court may further stay the proceeding until the foreign corporation or its successor obtains the certificate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A foreign corporation which transacts business in this state without a certificate of authority shall be liable to this state, for the years or parts of any years during which it transacted business in this state without a certificate of authority, in an amount equal to all fees and franchise fees which would have been imposed by this subdivision upon the corporation had it duly applied for and received a certificate of authority to transact business in this state as required by this subdivision and thereafter filed all required reports.  The corporation shall also be liable for any penalties imposed by this subdivision for failure to pay such fees and franchise fees.  The attorney general shall bring proceedings to recover all amounts due under the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the failure of a foreign corporation to obtain a certificate of authority does not impair the validity of its corporate acts or prevent it from defending any proceeding in this state.
