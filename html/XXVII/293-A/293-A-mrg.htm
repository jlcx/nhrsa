(5) if oral, when communicated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if (i) the electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form, and (ii) the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission.
<br>

(a) The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders, either exclusively or concurrently with the powers of the directors, by the articles of incorporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate.  That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The articles of incorporation may limit the type or specify the minimum amount of consideration for which the shares of any class or series may be issued.  A reference in the articles of incorporation to par value shall not, by itself, be deemed to be a specification of the minimum amount.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding RSA 293-A:6.21(d), when the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefore are fully paid and nonassessable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note is paid, or the benefits received.  If the services are not performed, the note is not paid, or the benefits are not received, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited may be cancelled in whole or part.

<center><h3>Section 293-A:6.30</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:6.30 Shareholders' Preemptive Rights. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares unless the articles of incorporation contain a statement that "the corporation elects to have preemptive rights,'' or words of similar import.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A corporation electing to have preemptive rights may include in its articles of incorporation a statement prescribing the type and extent of preemptive rights granted to the shareholders.  The statement may include, modify, or exclude any of the terms provided under subdivisions (1) through (6) of RSA 293-A:6.30(b).  If the articles of incorporation of a corporation electing to have preemptive rights do not include a statement prescribing the preemptive rights, the following terms shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A shareholder may waive his preemptive right.  A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) There is no preemptive right with respect to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) shares authorized in articles of incorporation that are issued within 6 months from the effective date of incorporation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) shares sold otherwise than for money.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights.  An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For purposes of this section, "shares'' includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.

<center><h3>Section 293-A:6.40</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:6.40 Distributions to Shareholders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in RSA 293-A:6.40(c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares), it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under RSA 293-A:6.40(c) either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Except as provided in RSA 293-A:6.40(g), the effect of a distribution under RSA 293-A:6.40(c) is measured:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) in the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of (i) the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation or (ii) the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) in the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) in all other cases, as of (i) the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or (ii) the date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (c) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section.  If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) This section shall not apply to distributions in liquidation under RSA 293-A:14.01 through RSA 293-A:14.34.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:7.04 Action Without Meeting. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action.  The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents bearing the date of signature and describing the action taken, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The articles of incorporation may provide that any action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting, and without prior notice, if consents in writing setting forth the action so taken are signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted.  The written consent shall bear the date of signature of the shareholder who signs the consent and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If not otherwise fixed under RSA 293-A:7.07 and if prior board action is not required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent is delivered to the corporation.  If not otherwise fixed under RSA 293-A:7.07 and if prior board action is required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date shall be the close of business on the day the resolution of the board taking such prior action is adopted.  No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest date on which a consent delivered to the corporation as required by this section was signed, written consents signed by sufficient shareholders to take the action have been delivered to the corporation.  A written consent may be revoked by a writing to that effect delivered to the corporation before unrevoked written consents sufficient in number to take the corporate action are delivered to the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A consent signed pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect of a vote taken at a meeting and may be described as such in any document.  Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors provides for a reasonable delay to permit tabulation of written consents, the action taken by written consent shall be effective when written consents signed by sufficient shareholders to take the action are delivered to the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If this chapter requires that notice of a proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation must give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the action not more than 10 days after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation, or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection (d).  The notice must reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision of this chapter, would have been required to be sent to nonvoting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If action is taken by less than unanimous written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation must give its nonconsenting voting shareholders written notice of the action promptly after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation, or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection (d).  The notice must reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision of this chapter, would have been required to be sent to voting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The notice requirements in subsections (e) and (f) shall not delay the effectiveness of actions taken by written consent, and a failure to comply with such notice requirements shall not invalidate actions taken by written consent, provided that this subsection shall not be deemed to limit judicial power to fashion any appropriate remedy in favor of a shareholder adversely affected by a failure to give such notice within the required time period.

(f) An appointment made irrevocable under subsection (d) is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if the transferee did not know of its existence when acquiring the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Subject to RSA 293-A:7.24 and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority stated in the appointment form or electronic transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.

(8) otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the shareholders, the directors, and the corporation, or among any of them, and is not contrary to public policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An agreement authorized by this section shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) as set forth (A) in the articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement or (B) in a written agreement that is signed by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement and is made known to the corporation;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement as required by RSA 293-A:6.26(b).  If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection.  The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it.  Any purchaser of shares who, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement shall be entitled to rescission of the purchase.  A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares.  An action to enforce the right of rescission authorized by this subsection must be commenced within the earlier of 90 days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or 2 years after the time of purchase of the shares.

(e) An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1)(i) the director conducted himself or herself in good faith;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) in all other cases, that the director's conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:8.62 Directors' Action. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Directors' action respecting a director's conflicting interest transaction is effective for purposes of RSA 293-A:8.61(b)(l) if the transaction has been authorized by the affirmative vote of a majority (but no fewer than 2) of the qualified directors who voted on the transaction, after required disclosure by the conflicted director of information not already known by such qualified directors, or after modified disclosure in compliance with subsection (b), provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the qualified directors have deliberated and voted outside the presence of and without the participation by any other director;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) where the action has been taken by a committee, all members of the committee were qualified directors, and either (i) the committee was composed of all the qualified directors on the board of directors or (ii) the members of the committee were appointed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified directors on the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), when a transaction is a director's conflicting interest transaction only because a related person described in clause (v) or clause (vi) of RSA 293-A:8.60(a)(5) is a party to or has a material financial interest in the transaction, the conflicted director is not obligated to make required disclosure to the extent that the director reasonably believes that doing so would violate a duty imposed under law, a legally enforceable obligation of confidentiality, or a professional ethics rule, provided that the conflicted director discloses to the qualified directors voting on the transaction:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) all information required to be disclosed that is not so violative,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the existence and nature of the director's conflicting interest, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the nature of the conflicted director's duty not to disclose the confidential information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A majority (but no fewer than 2) of all the qualified directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, constitutes a quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Where directors' action under this section does not satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the transaction by reason of the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or a provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization requirements must be taken by the board of directors or a committee, in which action directors who are not qualified directors may participate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:8.63 Shareholders' Action. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) Shareholders' action respecting a director's conflicting interest transaction is effective for purposes of RSA 293-A:8.61(b)(2) if a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all qualified shares are in favor of the transaction after (1) notice to shareholders describing the action to be taken respecting the transaction;  (2) provision to the corporation of the information referred to in subsection (b);  and (3) communication to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction of the information that is the subject of required disclosure, to the extent the information is not known by them.  In the case of shareholders' action at a meeting, the shareholders entitled to vote shall be determined as of the record date for notice of the meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction shall, before the shareholders' vote, inform the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, in writing, of the number of shares that the director knows are not qualified shares under subsection (c), and the identity of the holders of those shares.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For purposes of this section:  (1) "holder'' means and "held by'' refers to shares held by both a record shareholder (as defined in RSA 293-A:13.01(a)(11)) and a beneficial shareholder (as defined in RSA 293-A:13.01(a)(2));  and (2) "qualified shares'' means all shares entitled to be voted with respect to the transaction except for shares that the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes either knows, or under subsection (b) is notified, are held by (A) a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction or (B) a related person of the director (excluding a person described in clause (vi) of RSA 293-A:8.60(a)(5)).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of compliance with this section.  Subject to the provisions of subsection (e), shareholders' action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence of holders, or by the voting, of shares that are not qualified shares.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If a shareholders' vote does not comply with subsection (a) solely because of a director's failure to comply with subsection (b), and if the director establishes that the failure was not intended to influence and did not in fact determine the outcome of the vote, the court may take such action respecting the transaction and the director, and may give such effect, if any, to the shareholders' vote, as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Where shareholders' action under this section does not satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the transaction by reason of the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or a provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization requirements must be taken by the shareholders, in which action shares that are not qualified shares may participate.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In any proceeding seeking equitable relief or other remedies based upon an alleged improper taking advantage of a business opportunity by a director, the fact that the director did not employ the procedure described in subsection (a) before taking advantage of the opportunity shall not create an inference that the opportunity should have been first presented to the corporation or alter the burden of proof otherwise applicable to establish that the director breached a duty to the corporation in the circumstances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:9.21 Action on a Plan of Domestication. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In the case of a domestication of a domestic business corporation in a foreign jurisdiction:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The plan of domestication must be adopted by the board of directors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) After adopting the plan of domestication, the board of directors must submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval.  The board of directors must also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the plan, unless (i) the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation or (ii) RSA 293-A:8.26 applies.  If (i) or (ii) applies, the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of domestication to the shareholders on any basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If the approval of the shareholders is to be given at a meeting, the corporation must notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan of domestication is to be submitted for approval.  The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan.  The notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy of the articles of incorporation as they will be in effect immediately after the domestication.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting pursuant to RSA 293-A:9.21(a)(3), requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, approval of the plan of domestication requires the approval of each voting group entitled to vote separately on the plan by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by that voting group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Separate voting by voting groups is required by each class or series of shares that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) are to be reclassified under the plan of domestication into other securities, obligations, rights to acquire shares or other securities, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) would be entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision of the plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by separate voting groups under RSA 293-A:10.04;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve an amendment of the articles.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) If any provision of the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or an agreement to which any of the directors or shareholders are parties, adopted or entered into before January 1, 2014, applies to a merger of the corporation and that document does not refer to a domestication of the corporation, the provision shall be deemed to apply to a domestication of the corporation until such time as the provision is amended subsequent to that date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A plan of domestication may be approved for a participating corporation by written consent of shareholders entitled to vote, as provided in RSA 293-A:7.04.  If the plan of domestication is approved by written consent of all shareholders, whether or not entitled to vote, a resolution of the board of directors of the participating corporation approving, proposing, submitting, recommending, or otherwise respecting the plan of domestication is not necessary and shareholders of the participating corporation are not entitled to receive notice of or to dissent from the plan of domestication.

<center><h3>Section 293-A:9.50</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:9.50 Entity Conversion Authorized;  Definitions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A domestic business corporation may become a domestic unincorporated entity pursuant to a plan of entity conversion.  If the organic law of the unincorporated entity does not provide for such a conversion, RSA 293-A:9.55 governs the effect of converting to that form of entity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A domestic business corporation may become a foreign unincorporated entity if the entity conversion is permitted by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction.  The laws of the foreign jurisdiction governs the effect of converting to an unincorporated entity organized in that jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A domestic unincorporated entity may become a domestic business corporation.  If the organic law of a domestic unincorporated entity does not provide procedures for the approval of an entity conversion, the conversion shall be adopted and approved, and the entity conversion effectuated, in the same manner as a merger of the unincorporated entity.  If the organic law of a domestic unincorporated entity does not provide procedures for the approval of either an entity conversion or a merger, a plan of entity conversion shall be adopted and approved, the entity conversion effectuated, and appraisal rights exercised, in accordance with the procedures in RSA 293-A:9.50 through RSA 293-A:9.56 and RSA 293-A:13.01 through RSA 293-A:13.40.  Without limiting the provisions of this subsection, a domestic unincorporated entity whose organic law does not provide procedures for the approval of an entity conversion shall be subject to RSA 293-A:9.50(e) and RSA 293-A:9.52(a)(7).  For purposes of applying RSA 293-A:9.50 through RSA 293-A:9.56 and RSA 293-A:13.01 through RSA 293-A:13.40:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the unincorporated entity, its interest holders, interests and organic documents taken together, shall be deemed to be a domestic business corporation, shareholders, shares, and articles of incorporation, respectively and vice versa, as the context may require;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) if a group of persons manages the business and affairs of the unincorporated entity, whether identical or not identical to the interest holders, that group shall be deemed to be the board of directors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A foreign unincorporated entity may become a domestic business corporation if the organic law of the foreign unincorporated entity authorizes it to become a corporation in another jurisdiction.  The laws of the state of New Hampshire govern the effect of conversion to a domestic business corporation pursuant to RSA 293-A:9.50 through RSA 293-A:9.56.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If any debt security, note, or similar evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed, whether secured or unsecured, or a contract of any kind, issued, incurred, or signed by a domestic business corporation before the effective date of RSA 293-A:9.50 through RSA 293-A:9.56, applies to a merger of the corporation and the document does not refer to an entity conversion of the corporation, the provision shall be deemed to apply to an entity conversion of the corporation until such time as the provision is amended subsequent to that date.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) As used in this subdivision:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) "Converting entity'' means the domestic business corporation or domestic unincorporated entity that adopts a plan of entity conversion or the foreign unincorporated entity converting to a domestic business corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) "Surviving entity'' means the corporation or unincorporated entity that is in existence immediately after consummation of an entity conversion pursuant to this subdivision.

<center><h3>Section 293-A:9.52</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:9.52 Action on a Plan of Entity Conversion. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In the case of an entity conversion of a domestic business corporation to a domestic or foreign unincorporated entity:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The plan of entity conversion must be adopted by the board of directors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) After adopting the plan of entity conversion, the board of directors must submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval.  The board of directors must also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the plan, unless (i) the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation or (ii) RSA 293-A:8.26 applies.  If (i) or (ii) applies, the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of entity conversion to the shareholders on any basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If the approval of the shareholders is to be given at a meeting, the corporation must notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan of entity conversion is to be submitted for approval.  The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan.  The notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy of the organic documents as they will be in effect immediately after the entity conversion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting pursuant to RSA 293-A:9.52(a)(3), requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, approval of the plan of entity conversion requires the approval of each voting group entitled to vote separately on the plan by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by that voting group.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) If any provision of the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or an agreement to which any of the directors or shareholders are parties, adopted or entered into before the effective date of RSA 293-A:9.50 through RSA 293-A:9.56, applies to a merger of the corporation and the document does not refer to an entity conversion of the corporation, the provision shall be deemed to apply to an entity conversion of the corporation until such time as the provision is subsequently amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) If as a result of the conversion one or more shareholders of the corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of conversion shall require the signing, by each such shareholder who does not assert appraisal rights, of a separate written consent to become subject to such owner liability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) A plan of entity conversion may be approved for a participating corporation by written consent of shareholders entitled to vote, as provided in RSA 293-A:7.04.  If the plan of entity conversion is approved by written consent of all shareholders, whether or not entitled to vote, a resolution of the board of directors of the participating corporation approving, proposing, submitting, recommending, or otherwise respecting the plan of entity conversion is not necessary and shareholders of the participating corporation are not entitled to receive notice of or to dissent from the plan of entity conversion.

An individual shall not be considered a candidate for purposes of this subsection if the board of directors determines before the notice of meeting is given that such individual's candidacy does not create a bona fide election contest.

(2) against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds the party against whom expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the expenses incurred by any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly situated and that such expenses should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may direct that such expenses be paid out of the amounts awarded the shareholders who were benefited.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:14.30 Grounds for Judicial Dissolution. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The superior court for the county in which its principal office (or, if none in this state, its registered office) is located may dissolve a corporation:
<br>

(ii) the corporation has admitted in writing that the creditor's claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) in a proceeding by the corporation to have its voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:14.34 Election to Purchase in Lieu of Dissolution. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In a proceeding under RSA 293-A:14.30(a)(2) to dissolve a corporation, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect, one or more shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares.  An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within 90 days after the filing of the petition under RSA 293-A:14.30(a)(2) or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow.  If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner.  The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section.  Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than 30 days after the effective date of the notice to them.  All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs.  After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under RSA 293-A:14.30(a)(2) may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of his or her shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If, within 60 days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in RSA 293-A:14.34(c), the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the RSA 293-A:14.30(a)(2) proceedings and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under RSA 293-A:14.30(a)(2) was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them.  In allocating petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase.  Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed.  If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under subparagraphs (ii) or (iv) of RSA 293-A:14.30(a)(2), it may award costs, fees and expenses to the petitioning shareholder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Upon entry of an order under RSA 293-A:14.34(c) or (e), the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under RSA 293-A:14.30(a)(2), and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The purchase ordered pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.34(e) shall be made within 10 days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.02 and RSA 293-A:14.03, which articles must then be adopted and filed within 50 days thereafter.  Upon filing of such articles of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with the provisions of RSA 293-A:14.05 through RSA 293-A:14.07, and the order entered pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.34(e) shall no longer be of any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder costs, fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of RSA 293-A:14.34(e) and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under RSA 293-A:14.34(c) or (e), other than an award of costs, fees and expenses pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.34(e), is subject to the provisions of RSA 293-A:6.40.
