<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by RSA 293-A:6.26(b).  Unless so noted, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:6.30 Shareholder's Preemptive Rights. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation so provide.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement included in the articles of incorporation that "the corporation elects to have preemptive rights'', or words of similar import, means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A shareholder may waive his preemptive right.  A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) There is no preemptive right with respect to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) Shares authorized in articles of incorporation that are issued within 6 months from the effective date of incorporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iv) Shares sold otherwise than for money.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights, but without preferential rights to distributions or assets, have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets, unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights.  An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights.

<center><h3>Section 293-A:6.40</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:6.40 Distributions to Shareholders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A board of directors may authorize, and the corporation may make, distributions to its shareholders, subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (c) either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Except as provided in subsection (g), the effect of a distribution under subsection (c) is measured:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In all other cases, as of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (c) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section.  If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If not otherwise fixed under RSA 293-A:7.03 or RSA 293-A:7.07, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first shareholder signs the consent under subsection (a).

<codesect>
(a) One or more shareholders may create a voting trust, conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust, which may include anything consistent with its purpose, and transferring their shares to the trustee.  When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and agreement to the corporation's principal office.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All or some of the parties to a voting trust may extend it for additional terms of not more than 10 years each by signing an extension agreement and obtaining the voting trustee's written consent to the extension.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) eliminates the board of directors or restricts the discretion or powers of the board of directors;

(2) governs the authorization or making of distributions whether or not in proportion to ownership of shares, subject to the limitations in RSA 293-A:6.40;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) establishes who shall be directors or officers of the corporation, or their terms of office or manner of selection or removal;
<br>

(8) otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the shareholders, the directors and the corporation, or among any of them, and is not contrary to public policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An agreement authorized by this section shall be:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Set forth:  (A) in the articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement;  or (B) in a written agreement that is signed by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement and is made known to the corporation.
<br>

(2) Subject to amendment only by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Valid for 10 years, unless the agreement provides otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement as required by RSA 293-A:6.26(b).  If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection.  The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it.  Any purchaser of shares who, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement shall be entitled to rescission of the purchase.  A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares.  An action to enforce the right of rescission authorized by this subsection must be commenced within the earlier of 90 days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or 2 years after the time of purchase of the shares.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:8.31 Director Conflict of Interest. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest.  A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director's interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest where disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) the transaction was fair to the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if (1) another entity in which he has a material financial interest or in which he is a general partner is a party to the transaction or (2) another entity of which he is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For purposes of subsection (a)(1), a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director.  If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section.  The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (a)(1) if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in that subsection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For purposes of subsection (a)(2), a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection.  Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (b)(1), may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (a)(2).  The vote of those shares, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter.  A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

(1) he conducted himself in good faith;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) he reasonably believed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) in the case of conduct in his official capacity with the corporation, that his conduct was in its best interests;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) in all other cases, that his conduct was at least not opposed to its best interests;  and

(3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A director's conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose he reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement of subparagraph (a)(2)(ii).
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A corporation may not indemnify a director under this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 293-A:14.34 Election to Purchase in Lieu of Dissolution. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
(a) In a proceeding under RSA 293-A:14.30(b) to dissolve a corporation that has no shares listed on a national securities exchange or regularly traded in a market maintained by one or more members of a national or affiliated securities association, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect one or more shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares.  An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable, unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within 90 days after the filing of the petition under RSA 293-A:14.30(b) or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow.  If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders other than the petitioner.  The notice shall state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and shall advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section.  Shareholders who wish to participate shall file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than 30 days after the effective date of the notice to them.  All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs.  After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders the proceeding under RSA 293-A:14.30(b) shall not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of his shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders other than the petitioner to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If, within 60 days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (c), the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the RSA 293-A:14.30(b) proceedings and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under RSA 293-A:14.30(b) was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees, and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them.  In allocating petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court shall attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase.  Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Upon entry of an order under subsections (c) or (e), the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under RSA 293-A:14.30, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (e), shall be made within 10 days after the date the order becomes final, unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.02 and RSA 293-A:14.03, which articles shall then be adopted and filed within 50 days thereafter.  Upon filing of such articles of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with the provisions of RSA 293-A:14.05 through 293-A:14.07 and the order entered pursuant to subsection (e) shall no longer be of any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsections (c) or (e), other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (e) is subject to the provisions of RSA 293-A:6.40.
