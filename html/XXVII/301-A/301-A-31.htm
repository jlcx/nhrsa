Every association organized under this chapter shall prepare and submit to its annual meeting, and shall deliver to the secretary of state, a report of its condition, signed under the penalties of perjury by the president or treasurer.  Such report shall be made on or before April 1 of each year;  provided, however, that any association which has received its certificate of organization at any time between December 1 of the preceding year and April 1 shall not be required to file an annual report during that year.  The annual report shall be made on forms prescribed and furnished by the secretary of state on request, and the information in the report shall be given as of the preceding January 1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The report shall state the name and principal address of the association;  the names and addresses of the officers and directors;  a general statement of its business operations during the fiscal year;  the amount of paid-in capital and number of shareholders, if a share association;  the total number of members, including the number admitted or withdrawn during the year, if a nonshare association;  and the total receipts, expenditures, assets, and liabilities of the association.  The report shall be available for inspection by any member during normal working hours.
