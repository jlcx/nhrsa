&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 301:60 Consent to Jurisdiction. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any rural electric cooperative, without regard to whether a certificate of regulation or deregulation is on file with the public utilities commission, may voluntarily consent to jurisdiction by the commission for the purpose of participating in or initiating proceedings before the commission.  The cooperative's voluntary consent shall be nonrevocable and shall be in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the cooperative.  The consent may be limited to specific issues or requests for relief.  Any voluntary consent under this section shall be strictly limited in scope to the issues or proceedings identified in the written consent, and shall not be construed as a more general consent to jurisdiction.
