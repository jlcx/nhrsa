&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 301:58 Validity of Public Utilities Commission Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The filing of a certificate of deregulation with the public utilities commission by a rural electric cooperative shall cause the commission to terminate the involvement of the cooperative in any proceeding to the extent that such involvement is no longer under the jurisdiction of the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Orders of the commission concerning rural electric cooperatives, issued prior to the effective date of this section or at times when a certificate of regulation is on file shall not be rendered invalid by the filing of a certificate of deregulation, provided, however, that such orders shall not be enforceable as against the cooperative while a certificate of deregulation is on file with the commission.  Nothing in this section shall affect the validity or enforceability of orders of the commission concerning service territory, franchise boundaries, or any other matter over which the commission retains authority over a cooperative for which a certificate of deregulation is on file with the public utilities commission.
