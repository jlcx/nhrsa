<codesect>
An association and its members may make and execute marketing contracts, requiring the members to sell, for any period of time, not over 10 years, all or any specified part of their agricultural products or specified commodities exclusively to or through the association, or any facilities to be created by the association.  If they contract a sale to the association, it shall be conclusively held that title to the products passes to the association upon delivery except for legally recorded chattel mortgages given for value and prior to the first day of July in any season on such products or commodities whether such mortgages are given before or after the making of such contract of sale.  The contract may provide, among other things, that the association may sell or re-sell the products delivered by its members, with or without taking title thereto;  and pay over to its members the re-sale price, after deducting all necessary selling, overhead and other costs and expenses, including interest or dividends on stock, not exceeding 8 percent per annum, and reserves for retiring the stock, if any;  and other proper reserves;  and for any other deductions.
