I. If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver information in writing to another person, the requirement is satisfied if the information is provided, sent, or delivered, as the case may be, in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt.  An electronic record is not capable of retention by the recipient if the sender or its information processing system inhibits the ability of the recipient to print or store the electronic record.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The record must contain the information formatted in the manner specified in the other law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a sender inhibits the ability of a recipient to store or print an electronic record, the electronic record is not enforceable against the recipient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The requirements of this section may not be varied by agreement, but:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To the extent a law other than this chapter requires information to be provided, sent, or delivered in writing but permits that requirement to be varied by agreement, the requirement under paragraph I that the information be in the form of an electronic record capable of retention may also be varied by agreement;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A requirement under a law other than this chapter to send, communicate, or transmit a record by first-class mail, postage prepaid, or by regular United States mail may be varied by agreement to the extent permitted by the other law.
