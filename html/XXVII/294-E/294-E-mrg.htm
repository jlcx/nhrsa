<center><h3>Section 294-E:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 294-E:8 Provision of Information in Writing;  Presentation of Records. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver information in writing to another person, the requirement is satisfied if the information is provided, sent, or delivered, as the case may be, in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt.  An electronic record is not capable of retention by the recipient if the sender or its information processing system inhibits the ability of the recipient to print or store the electronic record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a law other than this chapter requires a record (i) to be posted or displayed in a certain manner, (ii) to be sent, communicated, or transmitted by a specified method, or (iii) to contain information that is formatted in a certain manner, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The record must be posted or displayed in the manner specified in the other law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph IV(b), the record must be sent, communicated, or transmitted by the method specified in the other law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The record must contain the information formatted in the manner specified in the other law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a sender inhibits the ability of a recipient to store or print an electronic record, the electronic record is not enforceable against the recipient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The requirements of this section may not be varied by agreement, but:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To the extent a law other than this chapter requires information to be provided, sent, or delivered in writing but permits that requirement to be varied by agreement, the requirement under paragraph I that the information be in the form of an electronic record capable of retention may also be varied by agreement;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A requirement under a law other than this chapter to send, communicate, or transmit a record by first-class mail, postage prepaid, or by regular United States mail may be varied by agreement to the extent permitted by the other law.

<center><h3>Section 294-E:9</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 294-E:9 Attribution and Effect of Electronic Record and Electronic Signature. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An electronic record or electronic signature is attributable to a person if it was the act of the person.  The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including a showing of the efficacy of any security procedure applied to determine the person to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The effect of an electronic record or electronic signature attributed to a person under paragraph I is determined from the context and surrounding circumstances at the time of its creation, execution, or adoption, including the parties' agreement, if any, and otherwise as provided by law.

<center><h3>Section 294-E:10</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 294-E:10 Effect of Change or Error. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If a change or error in an electronic record occurs in a transmission between parties to a transaction, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes or errors and one party has conformed to the procedure, but the other party has not, and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party also conformed, the conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or erroneous electronic record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other person's reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the other person, to destroy the consideration received, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Has not used or received any benefit or value from the consideration, if any, received from the other person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If neither paragraph I nor paragraph II applies, the change or error has the effect provided by other law, including the law of mistake, and the parties' contract, if any.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Paragraphs II and III may not be varied by agreement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 294-E:11 Notarization and Acknowledgment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If a law requires a signature or record to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by other applicable law, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 294-E:12 Retention of Electronic Records;  Originals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a law requires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record of the information in the record which:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Accurately reflects the information set forth in the record after it was first generated in its final form as an electronic record or otherwise;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Remains accessible and is capable of being accurately reproduced for later reference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A requirement to retain a record in accordance with paragraph I does not apply to any information the sole purpose of which is to enable the record to be sent, communicated, or received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A person may satisfy paragraph I by using the services of another person if the requirements of that paragraph are satisfied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a law requires a record to be presented or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if the record is not presented or retained in its original form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained in accordance with paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a law requires retention of a check, that requirement is satisfied by retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the check in accordance with paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A record retained as an electronic record in accordance with paragraph I satisfies a law requiring a person to retain a record for evidentiary, audit, or like purposes, unless a law enacted after the effective date of this chapter specifically prohibits the use of an electronic record for the specified purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. This section does not preclude a governmental agency of this state from specifying additional requirements for the retention of a record subject to the agency's jurisdiction.

In an automated transaction, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A contract may be formed by the interaction of electronic agents of the parties, even if no individual was aware of or reviewed the electronic agents' actions or the resulting terms and agreements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A contract may be formed by the interaction of an electronic agent and an individual, acting on the individual's own behalf or for another person, including by an interaction in which the individual performs actions that the individual is free to refuse to perform and which the individual knows or has reason to know will cause the electronic agent to complete the transaction or performance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The terms of the contract are determined by the substantive law applicable to it.

<center><h3>Section 294-E:15</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 294-E:15 Time and Place of Sending and Receipt. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is sent when it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is addressed properly or otherwise directed properly to an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Is in a form capable of being processed by that system;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Enters an information processing system outside the control of the sender or of a person that sent the electronic record on behalf of the sender or enters a region of the information processing system designated or used by the recipient which is under the control of the recipient.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unless otherwise agreed between a sender and the recipient, an electronic record is received when:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) It is in a form capable of being processed by that system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Paragraph II applies even if the place the information processing system is located is different from the place the electronic record is deemed to be received under paragraph IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from the sender's place of business and to be received at the recipient's place of business.  For purposes of this paragraph, the following rules apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the sender or recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest relationship to the underlying transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the sender's or recipient's residence, as the case may be.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An electronic record is received under paragraph II even if no individual is aware of its receipt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in paragraph II establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If a person is aware that an electronic record purportedly sent under paragraph I, or purportedly received under paragraph II, was not actually sent or received, the legal effect of the sending or receipt is determined by other applicable law.  Except to the extent permitted by the other law, the requirements of this section may not be varied by agreement.

<center><h3>Section 294-E:16</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 294-E:16 Transferable Records. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "transferable record'' means an electronic record that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Would be a note under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code or a document under Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code if the electronic record were in writing;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a transferable record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A system satisfies paragraph II, and a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs (d), (e), and (f), unalterable;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The person to which the transferable record was issued;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the authoritative copy indicates that the transferable record has been transferred, the person to which the transferable record was most recently transferred;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person asserting control or its designated custodian;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of a transferable record is the holder, as defined in Section 1-201(20) of the Uniform Commercial Code, of the transferable record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing under the Uniform Commercial Code, including, if the applicable statutory requirements under Section 3-302(a), 7-501, or 9-308 of the Uniform Commercial Code are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, respectively.  Delivery, possession, and indorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of the rights under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a transferable record has the same rights and defenses as an equivalent obligor under equivalent records or writings under the Uniform Commercial Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If requested by a person against which enforcement is sought, the person seeking to enforce the transferable record shall provide reasonable proof that the person is in control of the transferable record.  Proof may include access to the authoritative copy of the transferable record and related business records sufficient to review the terms of the transferable record and to establish the identity of the person having control of the transferable record.
