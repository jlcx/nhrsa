&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 292:1-a Legal Services. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Five or more persons of lawful age may associate together by articles of agreement to form a corporation, without a capital stock, for the purpose of providing professional legal services to the poor;  provided, however, that no such corporation shall commence business until its articles of agreement and by-laws, and such other information as may be required, have been submitted to the supreme court for approval and such court has authorized it to commence business upon finding that it is a responsible organization.  Such authorization may, after hearing, be revoked or suspended by the court for just cause.  The actual practice of law by such corporation shall be conducted solely by members of the New Hampshire bar in good standing, and the fact of incorporation shall not in any way be deemed to immunize any attorney employed by the corporation from personal responsibility and liability to the clients whom he serves.  The provisions of RSA 311:11 shall not apply to corporations organized under this section.
