<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A voluntary corporation may have one or more classes of members or may have no members.  In the absence of a provision in its articles or bylaws providing for members, a voluntary corporation has no members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a voluntary corporation has no members, an action for which there is no specific provision of this chapter applicable to a voluntary corporation without members and that would otherwise require approval of the members requires only the approval of the board of directors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Members are of one class unless the articles establish, or authorize the bylaws to establish, more than one class.  Members shall have no voting rights, except as specifically provided in the articles or bylaws.  The articles or bylaws may fix the term of membership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any provision of the articles or bylaws to the contrary, each individual board member and each member of a voluntary corporation entitled to vote shall be entitled to no more than one vote.
