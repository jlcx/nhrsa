&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 292:9 Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any such corporation, or  1/4 of the members thereof, may apply by petition to the superior court, or in the case of a charitable corporation to the superior court or the probate court, in the county in which the corporation is located, for a decree of dissolution, or for such other relief as may be just;  and the court, after due notice to all parties interested and a hearing, may decree that the corporation be dissolved, subject to such limitations and conditions as justice may require.  The attorney general shall be notified and given an opportunity to be heard in all cases involving charitable corporations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court shall have the right to appoint a guardian ad litem in the event that any members or shareholders, or both, are unknown or have abandoned a stock interest or membership interest in the corporation.  The guardian ad litem shall file a report with the court setting forth its findings with respect to:  the attempt to notify the unknown shareholders or members or both;  any response from the unknown shareholders or members or both;  and the length of time since the date of last contact by the unknown shareholder or member with the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The court shall have the discretion, after reviewing the report of the guardian ad litem, to conclude the extent of the rights and interests of the shareholders or members, or both, who are unknown or have abandoned their interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No member or shareholder shall be entitled to receive an amount from a dissolution of assets greater than the member's or shareholder's total contribution to capital or purchase price, or both, of membership certificates.  Any and all funds which may be payable to members or shareholders, or both, who have been adjudicated to have abandoned their interests under this section shall revert to the corporation as capital assets.
