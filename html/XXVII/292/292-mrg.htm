&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A corporation which is a "private foundation'' as defined in section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, shall not:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Engage in any act of "self-dealing'' (as defined in section 4941(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), which would give rise to any liability for the tax imposed by section 4941(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Retain any "excess business holdings'' (as defined in section 4943(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), which would give rise to any liability for the tax imposed by section 4943(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954;  nor
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Make any investment which would jeopardize the carrying out of any of its exempt purposes, within the meaning of section 4944 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, so as to give rise to any liability for the tax imposed by section 4944(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954;  nor
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Make any "taxable expenditures'' (as defined in section 4945(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) which would give rise to any liability for the tax imposed by section 4945(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

II. Each corporation which is a "private foundation'' as defined in section 509 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall distribute, for the purposes specified in its articles of organization, for each taxable year, amounts at least sufficient to avoid liability for the tax imposed by section 4942(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of paragraphs I and II shall apply to any corporation except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that to apply these provisions would be contrary to the terms of the articles of agreement or other instrument governing the corporation or the administration of charitable funds held by it, and that the articles or the other instrument cannot properly be changed to conform to these provisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section impairs the rights and powers of the courts or of the attorney general with respect to any corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All references to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 include amendments to those sections which are made after the effective date of this section, and include all corresponding provisions of any United States Internal Revenue laws which replace the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

<center><h3>Section 292:30</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 292:30 Revival of Charter. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any corporation whose charter has been repealed, revoked, and annulled pursuant to this subdivision may at any time apply for revival of its certificate of incorporation, together with all the rights, franchises, privileges, and immunities and subject to all of its duties, debts, and liabilities which have been secured or imposed by its original charter and all amendments thereto;  provided, that if the corporation name is no longer available under the terms of RSA 292:3, the corporation shall file with its application for revival an amendment changing its name or a consent to use its original name.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The application for revival of the charter may be procured by filing an application for revival in the office of the secretary of state, which application is signed under oath and under penalties of perjury by an officer of the corporation and which certificate states:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name of the corporation, which shall be the name it bore when its certificate of incorporation expired;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The address at which the business of the corporation is to be carried on;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The names and addresses of all the officers and directors or governing board of the corporation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That the corporation desiring to be revived and so reviving its charter was organized under the laws of this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The facts as may show that the charter has been forfeited pursuant to this subdivision;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) That the application is filed by authority of those who were directors or members of the governing body of the corporation at the time its charter was repealed, revoked, and annulled, or who were elected directors or members of the governing body of the corporation as provided in paragraph VI of this section;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) That the corporation has, as of the date of its application for revival, continued to operate consistent with its charter since such charter was repealed, revoked, and annulled;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) That such revival will be in the public good.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the filing of the application for revival, the secretary of state shall determine the completeness and accuracy of the application and schedule a hearing on such application pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.22-a.  When the revival is effective, the corporation shall be revived with the same force and effect as if its charter had not been forfeited pursuant to this subdivision.  Such reinstatement shall validate all contracts, acts, matters and things made, done and performed within the scope of its charter by the corporation, its officers and agents during the time when its charter was forfeited pursuant to this subdivision, with the same force and effect and to all intents and purposes as if the charter had at all times remained in full force and effect, except as provided in paragraph IX.  All real and personal property, rights and credits, which belonged to the corporation at the time its charter became forfeited pursuant to this subdivision and which were not disposed of prior to the time of its revival shall be vested in the corporation after its revival as fully and amply as they were held by the corporation at and before the time its charter became forfeited pursuant to this subdivision;  and the corporation after its revival shall be as exclusively liable for all contracts, acts, matters and things made, done or performed in its name and on its behalf by its officers and agents prior to its reinstatement, as if its charter had at all times remained in full force and effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any corporation seeking to revive its charter under the provisions of this chapter shall pay to the secretary of state a sum equal to all fees in arrears and due at the time its charter became forfeited pursuant to this subdivision plus a fee of $50.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a sufficient number of the last acting officers of any corporation desiring to revive its charter are not available by reason of death or unknown address, the directors of the corporation or those remaining on the board, even if only one, may elect successors to such officers.  In any case where there shall be no directors of the corporation available for the purposes aforesaid, the stockholders may elect a full board of directors as provided by the bylaws of the corporation and shall then elect such officers as are provided by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by the bylaws to carry on the business and affairs of the corporation.  A special meeting of the stockholders for the purposes of electing directors may be called by any officer, director or stockholder upon notice, which notice shall state the date, place and time of the meeting and the purpose thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. After a revival of the charter of the corporation shall have been effected (except where a special meeting of stockholders has been called in accordance with the provisions of paragraph V), the officers who signed the certificate of revival shall, jointly, forthwith call a special meeting of the stockholders of the corporation upon written notice, which notice shall state the date, place and time of the meeting and the purpose thereof.  At the special meeting the stockholders shall elect a full board of directors, which board shall then elect such officers as are provided by law, by the charter or by the bylaws to carry on the business and affairs of the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. For the purpose of this section, the term "director'' includes the governing body of a corporation which has no board of directors and the term "stockholder'' includes members of a corporation entitled to vote for members of the corporation's governing body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If the secretary of state is not satisfied that a certificate of revival is authorized by the directors or stockholders of a corporation as required by this section, he may decline to accept the certificate and the revival shall not occur.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Revival of a charter under this section shall not be construed to influence any pending actions or otherwise affect any liabilities or interfere with any course of action against such corporation for the period during which the charter was repealed or revoked.
