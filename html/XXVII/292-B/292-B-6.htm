&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court, upon application of an institution, may modify a restriction contained in a gift instrument regarding the management or investment of an institutional fund if the restriction has become impracticable or wasteful, if it impairs the management or investment of the fund, or if, because of circumstances not anticipated by the donor, a modification of a restriction will further the purposes of the fund.  The institution shall notify the attorney general of the application, and the attorney general must be given an opportunity to be heard.  To the extent practicable, any modification must be made in accordance with the donor's probable intention.

The institution shall notify the attorney general of the application, and the attorney general must be given an opportunity to be heard.
