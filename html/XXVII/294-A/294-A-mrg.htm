Where deemed necessary by the licensing authority for any profession in order to prevent violations of the ethical standards of the profession, the licensing authority may by rule further restrict, condition, or abridge the authority of professional corporations to issue shares.  No such rule shall, of itself, have the effect of causing a shareholder of a professional corporation at the time the rule becomes effective to become a disqualified person or of suspending the terms of any stock purchase, stock option or other agreement then in force providing for the purchase of shares by any person.  All shares issued in violation of this section or in violation of any rule adopted under this section shall be void.

If not so transferred, the shares shall be purchased or redeemed by the corporation to the extent of funds which may be legally made available for the purchase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the price for such shares is not fixed by the articles of incorporation, bylaws of the corporation or by private agreement, the corporation, within 6 months after the death or 30 days after the disqualification or transfer, shall make a written offer to pay for the shares at a specified price deemed by the corporation to be the fair value of the shares as of the date of the death, disqualification or transfer.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

I. If the disqualified person and the corporation do not agree on a fair value of the shares within 30 days after the written offer from the corporation, the corporation, within 30 days after receipt of written demand from the disqualified person given within 60 days after the date of the corporation's written offer shall, or at its election at any time within the period of 60 days may, file a petition in the superior court for the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located requesting that the fair value of the shares be found and determined.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the corporation fails to institute the proceeding as provided in this section the disqualified person may do so within 60 days after delivery of the written demand to the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The disqualified person, wherever residing, shall be made a party to the proceeding as an action against his shares quasi in rem.  A copy of the petition shall be personally served on the disqualified person, if a resident of this state, and shall be served by registered or certified mail on the disqualified person, if a nonresident.  Service on nonresidents may also be made by publication, if ordered by the court.  The jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The disqualified person shall be entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount of the fair value of his shares as of the date of death, disqualification, or transfer upon surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing the shares.  The court may, in its discretion, order that the judgment be paid in installments as the court may determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value.  The appraisers shall have the power and authority as specified in the order of their appointment or in an amendment of the order.

The costs and expenses of any proceeding under RSA 294-A:11 shall be determined by the court and shall be assessed against the corporation, provided that all or any part of the costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed, as the court may deem equitable, against the disqualified person if the court finds that the failure of the disqualified person to accept an offer from the corporation was frivolous or unreasonable.  The expenses shall include reasonable compensation for and reasonable expenses of the appraisers and may include the fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party.  However, if the fair value of the shares as determined materially exceeds the amount which the corporation offered to pay, or if no offer was made, the court in its discretion may award to the disqualified persons a sum which the court determines to be reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed by the disqualified person in the proceeding.
