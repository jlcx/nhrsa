<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b), if a domestic entity that is not a benefit corporation is a party to a merger or conversion or is the exchanging entity in a share exchange and the surviving, new, or resulting entity in the merger, conversion, or share exchange is to be a benefit corporation, the plan of merger, conversion, or share exchange shall be approved by the domestic entity by at least the minimum status vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
