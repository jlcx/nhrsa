<center><h3>Section 676:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 676:4 Board's Procedures on Plats. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The procedures to be followed by the planning board when considering or acting upon a plat or application submitted to it for approval under this title shall be as set forth in the board's subdivision regulations, subject to the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) An application for approval filed with the planning board under this title, other than an application for subdivision approval, shall be subject to the minimum requirements set forth in this section and shall be governed by the procedures set forth in the subdivision regulations, unless the planning board by regulation specifies other procedures for that type of application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The planning board shall specify by regulation what constitutes a completed application sufficient to invoke jurisdiction to obtain approval.  A completed application means that sufficient information is included or submitted to allow the board to proceed with consideration and to make an informed decision.  A completed application sufficient to invoke jurisdiction of the board shall be submitted to and accepted by the board only at a public meeting of the board, with notice as provided in subparagraph (d).  An application shall not be considered incomplete solely because it is dependent upon the issuance of permits or approvals from other governmental bodies;  however, the planning board may condition approval upon the receipt of such permits or approvals in accordance with subparagraph (i).  The applicant shall file the application with the board or its agent at least 15 days prior to the meeting at which the application will be accepted.  The application shall include the names and addresses of the applicant, all holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions as defined in RSA 477:45, and all abutters as indicated in the town records for incorporated towns or county records for unincorporated towns or unorganized places not more than 5 days before the day of filing.  Abutters shall also be identified on any plat submitted to the board.  The application shall also include the name and business address of every engineer, architect, land surveyor, or soil scientist whose professional seal appears on any plat submitted to the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c)(1) The board shall, at the next regular meeting or within 30 days following the delivery of the application, for which notice can be given in accordance with the requirements of subparagraph (b), determine if a submitted application is complete according to the board's regulation and shall vote upon its acceptance.  Upon determination by the board that a submitted application is incomplete according to the board's regulations, the board shall notify the applicant of the determination in accordance with RSA 676:3, which shall describe the information, procedure, or other requirement necessary for the application to be complete.  Upon determination by the board that a submitted application is complete according to the board's regulations, the board shall begin formal consideration and shall act to approve, conditionally approve as provided in subparagraph (i), or disapprove within 65 days, subject to extension or waiver as provided in subparagraph (f).  Upon failure of the board to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the application, the selectmen or city council shall, upon request of the applicant, immediately issue an order directing the board to act on the application within 30 days.  If the planning board does not act on the application within that 30-day time period, then within 40 days of the issuance of the order, the selectmen or city council shall certify on the applicant's application that the plat is approved pursuant to this paragraph, unless within those 40 days the selectmen or city council has identified in writing some specific subdivision regulation or zoning or other ordinance provision with which the application does not comply.  Such a certification, citing this paragraph, shall constitute final approval for all purposes including filing and recording under RSA 674:37 and 676:18, and court review under RSA 677:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Failure of the selectmen or city council to issue an order to the planning board under subparagraph (1), or to certify approval of the plat upon the planning board's failure to comply with the order, shall constitute grounds for the superior court, upon petition of the applicant, to issue an order approving the application if the court determines that the proposal complies with existing subdivision regulations and zoning or other ordinances.  If the court determines that the failure of the selectmen or the city council to act was not justified, the court may order the municipality to pay the applicant's reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, incurred in securing such order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) Notice to the applicant, holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions, abutters, and the public shall be given as follows:  The planning board shall notify the abutters, the applicant, holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions, and every engineer, architect, land surveyor, or soil scientist whose professional seal appears on any plat submitted to the board by certified mail of the date upon which the application will be formally submitted to the board.  Notice shall be mailed at least 10 days prior to submission.  Notice to the general public shall also be given at the same time by posting or publication as required by the subdivision regulations.  The notice shall include a general description of the proposal which is the subject of the application and shall identify the applicant and the location of the proposal.  For any public hearing on the application, the same notice as required for notice of submission of the application shall be given.  If notice of public hearing has been included in the notice of submission or any prior notice, additional notice of that hearing is not required nor shall additional notice be required of an adjourned session of a hearing with proper notice if the date, time, and place of the adjourned session was made known at the prior hearing.  All costs of notice, whether mailed, posted, or published, shall be paid in advance by the applicant.  Failure to pay such costs shall constitute valid grounds for the planning board to terminate further consideration and to disapprove the plat without a public hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For those proposals in which any structure or proposed building site will be within 500 feet of the top of the bank of any lake, pond, river, or stream, the planning board shall also notify the department of environmental services by first class mail at the same time that notice is provided to abutters, cost to be paid in advance by the applicant consistent with subparagraph (d)(1).  The sole purpose of notification to the department shall be to provide information to the department for dam hazard classification.  This requirement shall not confer upon the department the status of an abutter.  Failure by the municipality to notify the department shall not be considered a defect of notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Except as provided in this section, no application may be denied or approved without a public hearing on the application.  At the hearing, any applicant, abutter, holder of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restriction, or any person with a direct interest in the matter may testify in person or in writing.  Other persons may testify as permitted by the subdivision regulations or the board at each hearing.  Public hearings shall not be required, unless specified by the subdivision regulations, when the board is considering or acting upon:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Minor lot line adjustments or boundary agreements which do not create buildable lots, except that notice to abutters and holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions shall be given prior to approval of the application in accordance with subparagraph (d) and any abutter or holder of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions may be heard on the application upon request;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Disapprovals of applications based upon failure of the applicant to supply information required by the regulations, including identification of abutters or holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions;  or failure to meet reasonable deadlines established by the board;  or failure to pay costs of notice or other fees required by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The planning board may apply to the selectmen or city council for an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days before acting to approve or disapprove an application.  The applicant may waive the requirement for planning board action within the time periods specified in subparagraph (c) and consent to such extension as may be mutually agreeable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Reasonable fees in addition to fees for notice under subparagraph (d) may be imposed by the board to cover its administrative expenses and costs of special investigative studies, review of documents and other matters which may be required by particular applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) In case of disapproval of any application submitted to the planning board, the ground for such disapproval shall be adequately stated upon the records of the planning board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A planning board may grant conditional approval of a plat or application, which approval shall become final without further public hearing, upon certification to the board by its designee or based upon evidence submitted by the applicant of satisfactory compliance with the conditions imposed.  Such conditions may include a statement notifying the applicant that an approval is conditioned upon the receipt of state or federal permits relating to a project, however, a planning board may not refuse to process an application solely for lack of said permits.  Final approval of a plat or application may occur in the foregoing manner only when the conditions are:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Minor plan changes whether or not imposed by the board as a result of a public hearing, compliance with which is administrative and which does not involve discretionary judgment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Conditions which are in themselves administrative and which involve no discretionary judgment on the part of the board;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Conditions with regard to the applicant's possession of permits and approvals granted by other boards or agencies or approvals granted by other boards or agencies, including state and federal permits.
<br>
All conditions not specified within this subparagraph as minor, administrative, or relating to issuance of other approvals shall require a hearing, and notice as provided in subparagraph I(d), except that additional notice shall not be required of an adjourned session of a hearing with proper notice if the date, time, and place of the adjourned session were made known at the prior hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A planning board may provide for preliminary review of applications and plats by specific regulations subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Preliminary conceptual consultation phase.  The regulations shall define the limits of preliminary conceptual consultation which shall be directed at review of the basic concept of the proposal and suggestions which might be of assistance in resolving problems with meeting requirements during final consideration.  Such consultation shall not bind either the applicant or the board and statements made by planning board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating any action taken.  The board and the applicant may discuss proposals in conceptual form only and in general terms such as desirability of types of development and proposals under the master plan.  Such discussion may occur without the necessity of giving formal public notice as required under subparagraph I(d), but such discussions may occur only at formal meetings of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Design review phase.  The board or its designee may engage in nonbinding discussions with the applicant beyond conceptual and general discussions which involve more specific design and engineering details;  provided, however, that the design review phase may proceed only after identification of and notice to abutters, holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions, and the general public as required by subparagraph I(d).  The board may establish reasonable rules of procedure relating to the design review process, including submission requirements.  At a public meeting, the board may determine that the design review process of an application has ended and shall inform the applicant in writing within 10 days of such determination.  Statements made by planning board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating any action taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Preliminary review shall be separate and apart from formal consideration under paragraph I, and the time limits for acting under subparagraph I(c) shall not apply until formal application is submitted under subparagraph I(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A planning board may, by adopting regulations, provide for an expedited review and approval for proposals involving minor subdivisions which create not more than 3 lots for building development purposes or for proposals which do not involve creation of lots for building development purposes.  Such expedited review may allow submission and approval at one or more board meetings, but no application may be approved without the full notice to the abutters, holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions, and public required under subparagraph I(d).  A hearing, with notice as provided in subparagraph I(d), shall be held if requested by the applicant, abutters, or holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions any time prior to approval or disapproval or if the planning board determines to hold a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Jurisdiction of the courts to review procedural aspects of planning board decisions and actions shall be limited to consideration of compliance with applicable provisions of the constitution, statutes and regulations.  The procedural requirements specified in this section are intended to provide fair and reasonable treatment for all parties and persons.  The planning board's procedures shall not be subjected to strict scrutiny for technical compliance.  Procedural defects shall result in the reversal of a planning board's actions by judicial action only when such defects create serious impairment of opportunity for notice and participation.

<center><h3>Section 676:5</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 676:5 Appeals to Board of Adjustment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Appeals to the board of adjustment concerning any matter within the board's powers as set forth in RSA 674:33 may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality affected by any decision of the administrative officer.  Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.  The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purposes of this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The "administrative officer'' means any official or board who, in that municipality, has responsibility for issuing permits or certificates under the ordinance, or for enforcing the ordinance, and may include a building inspector, board of selectmen, or other official or board with such responsibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A "decision of the administrative officer'' includes any decision involving construction, interpretation or application of the terms of the ordinance.  It does not include a discretionary decision to commence formal or informal enforcement proceedings, but does include any construction, interpretation or application of the terms of the ordinance which is implicated in such enforcement proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If, in the exercise of subdivision or site plan review, the planning board makes any decision or determination which is based upon the terms of the zoning ordinance, or upon any construction, interpretation, or application of the zoning ordinance, which would be appealable to the board of adjustment if it had been made by the administrative officer, then such decision may be appealed to the board of adjustment under this section;  provided, however, that if the zoning ordinance contains an innovative land use control adopted pursuant to RSA 674:21 which delegates administration, including the granting of conditional or special use permits, to the planning board, then the planning board's decision made pursuant to that delegation cannot be appealed to the board of adjustment, but may be appealed to the superior court as provided by RSA 677:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board of adjustment may impose reasonable fees to cover its administrative expenses and costs of special investigative studies, review of documents, and other matters which may be required by particular appeals or applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) A board of adjustment reviewing a land use application may require the applicant to reimburse the board for expenses reasonably incurred by obtaining third party review and consultation during the review process, provided that the review and consultation does not substantially replicate a review and consultation obtained by the planning board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A board of adjustment retaining services under subparagraph (a) shall require detailed invoices with reasonable task descriptions for services rendered.  Upon request of the applicant, the board of adjustment shall promptly provide a reasonably detailed accounting of expenses, or corresponding escrow deductions, with copies of supporting documentation.

The effect of an appeal to the board shall be to maintain the status quo.  An appeal of the issuance of any permit or certificate shall be deemed to suspend such permit or certificate, and no construction, alteration, or change of use which is contingent upon it shall be commenced.  An appeal of any order or other enforcement action shall stay all proceedings under the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment, after notice of appeal shall have been filed with such officer, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the officer's opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health, safety, property, or the environment.  In such case, the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by the superior court on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and cause shown.

I. Prior to exercising its appeals powers, the board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing.  Notice of the public hearing shall be given as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The appellant and every abutter and holder of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions shall be notified of the hearing by certified mail stating the time and place of the hearing, and such notice shall be given not less than 5 days before the date fixed for the hearing of the appeal.  The board shall hear all abutters and holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions desiring to submit testimony and all nonabutters who can demonstrate that they are affected directly by the proposal under consideration.  The board may hear such other persons as it deems appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A public notice of the hearing shall be placed in a newspaper of general circulation in the area not less than 5 days before the date fixed for the hearing of the appeal.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In municipalities which have established one or more historic districts pursuant to RSA 674:46, but which have no local zoning ordinances, the historic district commission shall have within the bounds of the historic district all the authority, powers and duties prescribed in this chapter for planning boards insofar as such authority, powers and duties are within the intent of the historic district commission's grant of power.  In such municipalities, the requirement of conformity with the local zoning ordinance, as provided in RSA 674:46, shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In municipalities which do not have a planning board, the requirements of RSA 674:46 and 676:6 relating to conformity with the master plan and the requirement of RSA 673:4 that one member of the commission may be a planning board member shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In municipalities which do not have a building inspector, the certificate of approval of the commission, as provided in RSA 676:8, III, shall be the equivalent of a building permit.  In municipalities which do not have a zoning board of adjustment, motions for rehearing and appeals from decisions of the historic district commission shall be governed by the provisions of RSA 677, insofar as applicable.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The proposed changes in the building code or the zoning ordinance would, if adopted, justify refusal of such permit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After final action has been taken on the proposed changes in the building code or zoning ordinance, the building inspector shall issue or refuse to issue a permit which has been held in abeyance under this section pursuant to a final action under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of paragraph I shall not be applicable in a city or in a county in which there are located unincorporated towns or unorganized places unless the governing body of the city or the county votes by majority vote to be subject to the provisions of such paragraph.

IV. The building inspector may be authorized by the local legislative body to issue a temporary occupancy permit not to exceed 30 days, which may be extended at the discretion of the building inspector.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No building permit shall be denied on the grounds of uncompleted streets or utilities when the construction of such streets or utilities has been secured to the municipality by a bond or other security approved by the planning board pursuant to RSA 674:36, III or RSA 674:44, IV;  provided, however, that on land which is part of a subdivision plat or site plan, no building shall be used or occupied prior to the completion of required streets and utilities, except upon such terms as the planning board may have authorized as part of its decision approving the plat or site plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The provisions of paragraph I shall not apply to any plat or application which has been the subject of notice by the planning board pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(d) prior to the first legal notice of a proposed change in a building code or zoning ordinance or any amendment thereto.  No proposed subdivision or site plan review or zoning ordinance or amendment thereto shall affect a plat or application which has been the subject of notice by the planning board pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(d) so long as said plat or application was the subject of notice prior to the first legal notice of said change or amendment.  The provisions of this paragraph shall also apply to proposals submitted to a planning board for design review pursuant to RSA 676:4, II(b), provided that a formal application is filed with the planning board within 12 months of the end of the design review process.

Each day that a violation continues shall be a separate offense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In any legal action brought by a municipality to enforce, by way of injunctive relief as provided by RSA 676:15 or otherwise, any local ordinance, code or regulation adopted under this title, or to enforce any planning board, zoning board of adjustment or building code board of appeals decision made pursuant to this title, or to seek the payment of any fine levied under paragraph I, the municipality shall recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees actually expended in pursuing the legal action if it is found to be a prevailing party in the action.

At the hearing, the burden shall be on the municipality to show that there is a strong likelihood that it will prevail on the merits, that the penalties or remedies sought are reasonably likely to be awarded by the court in an amount consistent with the bond sought, and that the bond represents the amount of the projected expense of compliance with the injunctive relief sought.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 676:17-a Cease and Desist Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The building inspector, code enforcement officer, zoning administrator or other official designated as an enforcement authority by ordinance or resolution of the local legislative body may issue a cease and desist order against any violation of this title, any local ordinance, code or regulation adopted under this title, or any provision or specification of an application, plat, or plan approved by, or any requirement or condition of a permit or decision issued by, any local administrator or land use board acting under the authority of this title, subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The order shall state, in writing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The precise regulation, provision, specification or condition which is being violated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The facts constituting the violation, including the date of any inspection from which these facts were ascertained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The corrective action required, including a reasonable time within which such action shall be taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A statement that a motion for summary enforcement of the order shall be made to the court of the district in which the property is situated unless such corrective action is taken within the time provided, or unless an answer is filed within 20 days, as provided in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A statement that failure to either take the corrective action, or to file an answer, may result in corrective action being taken by the municipality, and that if this occurs the municipality's costs shall constitute a lien against the real estate, enforceable in the same manner as real estate taxes, including possible loss of the property if not paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The order shall be served upon the record owner of the property or the record owner's agent, and upon the person to whom taxes are assessed for the property, if other than the owner, and upon any occupying tenant of the property, and upon any other person known by the enforcing officer to exercise control over the premises in violation, and upon all persons holding mortgages upon such property as recorded in the office of the register of deeds, in the same manner provided for service of a summons in a civil action in district court.  Personal service may be made by a sheriff, deputy sheriff, local police officer, or constable.  If the owner is unknown or cannot be found, the order shall be served by posting it upon the property and by 4 weeks' publication in a newspaper in general circulation in the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon service of the order, the owner or the owner's agent, occupying tenant or the tenant's agent, or any other person who is engaged in development, construction, excavation, or other changes of the land or buildings on the land shall cease immediately such activities, if so provided in the order, until such time as judgment is rendered under paragraphs VI or VII.  Failure to cease such activity shall constitute a separate violation of this title in addition to the violation cited in the order, unless such order is annulled as provided in paragraph VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A copy of the order with proof of service shall be filed with clerk of the district court of the district in which the property is located not fewer than 5 days prior to the filing of a motion to enforce under paragraph VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Within 20 days after the date of service, any person upon whom the order is served may serve an answer in the manner provided for the service of an answer in a civil action, specifically denying such facts in the order as are in dispute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If no answer is served, the enforcement official may move the court for the enforcement of the order.  If such a motion is made the court may, upon the presentation of such evidence as it may require, affirm or modify the order and enter judgment accordingly, fixing a time after which the governing body may proceed with the enforcement of the order.  The clerk of the court shall mail a copy of the judgment to all persons upon whom the original order was served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If an answer is filed and served as provided in paragraph V, further proceedings in the action shall be governed by the rules of the district court.  If the order is sustained following trial, the court shall enter judgment and shall fix a time within which the corrective action shall be taken, in compliance with the order as originally filed, or as modified by the court.  If the order is not sustained, it shall be annulled and set aside.  If it appears to the court that the order was frivolous, was commenced in bad faith, or was not based upon information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry or was not well-grounded in fact, then the court shall order the defendant's costs and reasonable attorneys fees to be paid by the municipality.  The clerk of the court shall mail a copy of the judgment to the persons upon whom the original order was served.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. If a judgment is not complied with in the time prescribed, the local governing body may cause the corrective action to be taken as set forth in the judgment.  The cost to the municipality of taking such corrective action together with its other expenses as provided in paragraph IX, shall be a lien against the real estate on which the violation occurred, which shall continue for 18 months from the date upon which the expense account is allowed by the court, as provided in paragraph IX.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The municipality shall keep an accurate account of the expenses incurred in carrying out the order and of all other expenses in connection with its enforcement, including but not limited to filing fees, service fees, publication fees, the expense of searching the registry of deeds to identify mortgages, witness and expert fees, attorneys fees and traveling expenses.  The court shall examine, correct if necessary, and allow the expense account.  The municipal governing body, by majority vote, may commit the expense account to the collector of taxes, in which case the mayor, as defined by RSA 672:9, shall direct the expense account, together with a warrant under the mayor's hand and seal, to the municipal tax collector, requiring the tax collector to collect the same from the person to whom real estate taxes are assessed for the premises upon which such corrective action was taken, and to pay the amount so collected to the municipal treasurer.  Within 30 days after the receipt of such warrant, the collector shall send a bill as provided in RSA 76:11.  Interest as provided in RSA 76:13 shall be charged on any amount not paid within 30 days after the bill is mailed.  The collector shall have the same rights and remedies as in the collection of taxes, as provided in RSA 80.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. A party aggrieved by the judgment of the district court may appeal, within 15 days after the rendering of such judgment, to the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The remedy provided in this section is supplementary to other enforcement remedies provided by this chapter or local ordinance.  At the discretion of the local enforcement official, an action to enforce a cease and desist order under this section may be joined with an action under RSA 676:17, I, and the cease and desist order shall constitute the written notice under RSA 676:17, I(b).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 676:17-b Local Land Use Citations;  Pleas by Mail. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A building inspector or other local official with authority to prosecute an offense within the scope of RSA 676:17, and who, prior to or at the time of serving the summons, elects, pursuant to RSA 676:17, V, to charge the offense as a violation, may issue and serve upon the defendant, in addition to the summons, a local land use citation as set forth in this section.  The defendant receiving such a citation may plead guilty or nolo contendere by mail by entering that plea as provided herein.  If such a plea is accepted by the court, the defendant shall not be required to appear personally or by counsel;  otherwise the defendant shall appear as directed by the court.  The following procedure shall be used:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No local land use citation as set forth in this section shall be served unless the defendant has first been given written notice of the violation by the municipality.  If the notice involves or includes a decision which may be appealed to the zoning board of adjustment pursuant to RSA 676:5, or to the building code board of appeals pursuant to RSA 674:34, such notice to the building code board of appeals pursuant to RSA 674:34, such notice shall set forth a reasonable period, as provided by the rules of the respective board, in no case less than 7 days, within which such appeal shall be filed after receipt of the written notice, and the citation shall not be served until after the end of such period.  If such an appeal is filed, further proceedings shall be governed by RSA 676:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The local land use citation shall contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The caption:  "Local Land Use Citation, Town (City) of ___''.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The name of the offender, and address if known to the prosecuting official.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The statute, code, ordinance, regulation, provision, specification, requirement or condition the offender is charged with violating.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The act or circumstances constituting the violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The place of the violation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The date upon which the offender received written notice of the violation by the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The time and date upon which the violation was witnessed subsequent to such written notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The amount of the civil penalty as set forth in RSA 676:17, I(b), which is payable by the offender for each day the violation continued subsequent to such written notice, up to a maximum of 5 days' violation charged in one citation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Instructions informing the defendant that the defendant may answer the citation by mail or may personally appear in court upon the date on the summons, and instructing the defendant how to enter a plea by mail, together with either the amount of the penalty specified in the citation, or a request for a trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The address of the clerk of the district court, where the plea by mail may be entered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) A warning to the defendant that failure to respond to the citation on or before the date on the summons may result in the defendant's arrest as provided in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) The signature of the prosecuting official.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Defendants who are issued a summons and local land use citation and who wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere shall enter their plea on the summons and return it with payment of the civil penalty, as set forth in the citation, to the clerk of the court prior to the arraignment date, or shall appear in court on the date of arraignment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Civil penalties collected by the district court under this section shall be remitted to the municipality issuing the citation.  Whenever a defendant (a) does not enter a plea by mail prior to the arraignment day or does not appear personally or by counsel on or before that date or move for a continuance;  or (b) otherwise fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance in connection with a summons for any offense, the defendant shall be defaulted and the court shall determine what the civil penalty would be upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and shall impose an administrative processing fee in addition to the civil penalty.  Such fee shall be the same as the administrative processing fee under RSA 502-A:19-b, and shall be retained by the court for the benefit of the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court may, in its discretion, issue a bench warrant for the arrest of any defendant who:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is defaulted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph IV of this section;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Fails to pay a fine or other penalty imposed in connection with a conviction under this title which a court has determined the defendant is able to pay, or issues a bad check in payment of a fine or other penalty;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Fails to comply with a similar order on any matter within the court's discretion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. For cause, the court in its discretion may refuse to accept a plea by mail and may impose a fine or penalty other than that stated in the local land use citation.  The court may order the defendant to appear personally in court for the disposition of the defendant's case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The prosecuting official may serve additional local land use citations, without giving additional written notice or appeal opportunity under paragraph I, if the facts or circumstances constituting the violation continue beyond the date or dates of any prior citation.  A plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the prior citation shall not affect the rights of the defendant with respect to a subsequent citation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Forms and rules for the local land use citation and summons shall be developed and adopted by the New Hampshire supreme court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. This section is not intended in any way to abrogate other enforcement actions or remedies in the district or superior court pursuant to this title, nor to require written notice as a prerequisite to other types of actions or remedies under this title.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 676:18 Register of Deeds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A register of deeds who files or records a plat of a subdivision without the approval of a planning board shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, the register of deeds shall accept for recording a plat prepared and certified by a licensed land surveyor or by a former registered land surveyor if such plat bears a certificate by a licensed or registered land surveyor that this survey plat is not a subdivision pursuant to this title and that the lines of streets and ways shown are those of public or private streets or ways already established and that no new ways are shown.  The recording of any such plat shall not relieve any owner from compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I or II, the register of deeds may accept for recording a plat without the licensed land surveyor's seal if such plat was in existence on December 31, 1969, or if the plat has been incorporated into deeds or other instruments recorded before town zoning ordinances or planning board subdivision regulations, or both, became effective in that particular town.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The certificate by a licensed land surveyor shall be in the following form:
<br>
"I certify that this survey plat is not a subdivision pursuant to this title and that the lines of streets and ways shown are those of public or private streets or ways already established and that no new ways are shown.''

IV. Prior to recording any plat in the registry of deeds, the surveyor shall file, for information purposes only, a copy of the survey with the town planning board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. All decisions of the district, superior, and supreme courts, which affect property boundaries, shall be recorded by the register of deeds in the registry of deeds for the county in which the site is situated, and, upon recordation, such decision shall run with the land.  Subsequent to any probate court decision creating divisions of land, a survey plat shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor, which, if approved by the probate court, shall be recorded, along with the court's decision, at the registry of deeds without local planning board approval.  The recording of such decision or plat, however, shall not be deemed to authorize any transfer or development of the property in violation of any applicable local land use regulations adopted pursuant to this title.
