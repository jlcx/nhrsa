&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 676:13 Building Permits Restricted. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The building inspector shall not issue any building or occupancy permit for any proposed construction, remodeling, or maintenance which will not comply with any or all zoning ordinances, building codes, or planning board regulations which are in effect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any building inspector is prosecuted for violation of RSA 643:1 and found guilty of issuing any permit contrary to the provisions of this section, it shall be prima facie evidence that the building inspector has knowingly refrained from performing a duty imposed on the building inspector by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The building inspector shall adopt a form or set of standards specifying the minimum contents of a completed application for any building permit.  Upon the submission of a completed application, the building inspector shall act to approve or deny a building permit within 30 days;  provided, however, that nonresidential applications or residential applications encompassing more than 10 dwelling units shall be approved or denied within 60 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The time for the building inspector to act upon building permits for collocation applications and modification applications for personal wireless service facilities shall be governed by RSA 12-K:10.  In the event that the form or set of standards for a building permit application conflicts with any of the limitations under RSA 12-K:11 for a collocation application or a modification application for a personal wireless service facility, the limitations in RSA 12-K:11 shall control.
