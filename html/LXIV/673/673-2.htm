(2) The selectmen shall choose one selectman or administrative official of the town as an ex officio member and the remaining planning board positions shall be filled on a staggered basis at the subsequent regular town elections pursuant to RSA 669:17 as the term of an appointed member expires, until each member of the board is an elected member.  The maximum number of elections to occur annually shall be as provided in RSA 673:5, II.  When each planning board member is an elected member, such member shall be elected for the term provided in RSA 673:5, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A local legislative body which has voted to elect planning board members may, by majority vote at town meeting, decide to rescind that action and have the planning board appointed in the manner set forth in subparagraph (a).  The vote to have planning board members so appointed shall take effect upon adoption by the town meeting, and the selectmen shall forthwith appoint members in accordance with RSA 673:5.  The planning board shall, however, continue in existence, and the elected members in office at the time of the town meeting vote to appoint members may continue to serve until their successors are appointed and qualified.
<br>
