&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:39-a Voluntary Merger. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any owner of 2 or more contiguous preexisting approved or subdivided lots or parcels who wishes to merge them for municipal regulation and taxation purposes may do so by applying to the planning board or its designee.  Except where such merger would create a violation of then-current ordinances or regulations, all such requests shall be approved, and no public hearing or notice shall be required.  No new survey plat need be recorded, but a notice of the merger, sufficient to identify the relevant parcels and endorsed in writing by the planning board or its designee, shall be filed for recording in the registry of deeds, and a copy mailed to the municipality's assessing officials.  No such merged parcel shall thereafter be separately transferred without subdivision approval.  No city, town, county, or village district may merge preexisting subdivided lots or parcels except upon the consent of the owner.
