&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:72 Accessory Dwelling Units. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A municipality that adopts a zoning ordinance pursuant to the authority granted in this chapter shall allow accessory dwelling units as a matter of right or by either conditional use permit pursuant to RSA 674:21 or by special exception, in all zoning districts that permit single-family dwellings.  One accessory dwelling unit shall be allowed without additional requirements for lot size, frontage, space limitations, or other controls beyond what would be required for a single-family dwelling without an accessory dwelling unit.  The municipality is not required to allow more than one accessory dwelling unit for any single-family dwelling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a zoning ordinance contains no provisions pertaining to accessory dwelling units, then one accessory dwelling unit shall be deemed a permitted accessory use, as a matter of right, to any single-family dwelling in the municipality, and no municipal permits or conditions shall be required other than a building permit, if necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An interior door shall be provided between the principal dwelling unit and the accessory dwelling unit, but a municipality shall not require that it remain unlocked.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any municipal regulation applicable to single-family dwellings shall also apply to the combination of a principal dwelling unit and an accessory dwelling unit including, but not limited to lot coverage standards and standards for maximum occupancy per bedroom consistent with policy adopted by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.  A municipality may require adequate parking to accommodate an accessory dwelling unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The applicant for a permit to construct an accessory dwelling unit shall make adequate provisions for water supply and sewage disposal for the accessory dwelling unit in accordance with RSA 485-A:38, but separate systems shall not be required for the principal and accessory dwelling units.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A municipality may require owner occupancy of one of the dwelling units, but it shall not specify which unit the owner must occupy.  A municipality may require that the owner demonstrate that one of the units is his or her principal place of residence, and the municipality may establish reasonable regulations to enforce such a requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A municipality may establish standards for accessory dwelling units for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetic continuity with the principal dwelling unit as a single-family dwelling.  A municipality may also establish minimum and maximum sizes for an accessory dwelling unit, provided that size may not be restricted to less than 750 square feet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A municipality may not require a familial relationship between the occupants of an accessory dwelling unit and the occupants of a principal dwelling unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. A municipality may not limit an accessory dwelling unit to only one bedroom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. An accessory dwelling unit may be deemed a unit of workforce housing for purposes of satisfying the municipality's obligation under RSA 674:59 if the unit meets the criteria in RSA 674:58, IV for rental units.
