<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In every municipality that exercises the power to adopt land use ordinances and regulations, such ordinances and regulations shall provide reasonable and realistic opportunities for the development of workforce housing, including rental multi-family housing.  In order to provide such opportunities, lot size and overall density requirements for workforce housing shall be reasonable.  A municipality that adopts land use ordinances and regulations shall allow workforce housing to be located in a majority, but not necessarily all, of the land area that is zoned to permit residential uses within the municipality.  Such a municipality shall have the discretion to determine what land areas are appropriate to meet this obligation.  This obligation may be satisfied by the adoption of inclusionary zoning as defined in RSA 674:21, IV(a).  This paragraph shall not be construed to require a municipality to allow for the development of multifamily housing in a majority of its land zoned to permit residential uses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A municipality shall not fulfill the requirements of this section by adopting voluntary inclusionary zoning provisions that rely on inducements that render workforce housing developments economically unviable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A municipality's existing housing stock shall be taken into consideration in determining its compliance with this section.  If a municipality's existing housing stock is sufficient to accommodate its fair share of the current and reasonably foreseeable regional need for such housing, the municipality shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subdivision and RSA 672:1, III-e.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Paragraph I shall not be construed to require municipalities to allow workforce housing that does not meet reasonable standards or conditions of approval related to environmental protection, water supply, sanitary disposal, traffic safety, and fire and life safety protection.
