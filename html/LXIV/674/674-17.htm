&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:17 Purposes of Zoning Ordinances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every zoning ordinance shall be adopted in accordance with the requirements of RSA 674:18.  Zoning ordinances shall be designed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To lessen congestion in the streets;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To secure safety from fires, panic and other dangers;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To promote health and the general welfare;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) To provide adequate light and air;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) To prevent the overcrowding of land;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) To avoid undue concentration of population;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) To facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, solid waste facilities, water, sewerage, schools, parks, child day care;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) To assure proper use of natural resources and other public requirements;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) To encourage the preservation of agricultural lands and buildings and the agricultural operations described in RSA 21:34-a supporting the agricultural lands and buildings;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) To encourage the installation and use of solar, wind, or other renewable energy systems and protect access to energy sources by the regulation of orientation of streets, lots, and buildings;  establishment of maximum building height, minimum set back requirements, and limitations on type, height, and placement of vegetation;  and encouragement of the use of solar skyspace easements under RSA 477.  Zoning ordinances may establish buffer zones or additional districts which overlap existing districts and may further regulate the planting and trimming of vegetation on public and private property to protect access to renewable energy systems.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every zoning ordinance shall be made with reasonable consideration to, among other things, the character of the area involved and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, as well as with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in RSA 424:5 or RSA 422-B or in any other provision of Title XXXIX, no city, town, or county in which there are located unincorporated towns or unorganized places shall adopt a zoning ordinance or regulation with respect to antennas used exclusively in the amateur radio service that fails to conform to the limited federal preemption entitled Amateur Radio Preemption, 101 FCC 2nd 952 (1985) issued by the Federal Communications Commission.
