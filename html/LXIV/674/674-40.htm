A municipality which has established and recorded an official map, as provided in RSA 674:10, or has conferred upon a planning board platting jurisdiction in accordance with RSA 674:35 shall not thereafter accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street or lay or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections, or other facilities or utilities in any street, within any portion of the municipality unless such street:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The local legislative body may, however, accept, locate and construct any street not shown on or not corresponding with a street on the official map or on an approved subdivision plat or an approved street plat, provided the ordinance or other measure for the accepting, locating, and construction of such street is first submitted to the planning board for its approval and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If approved by the board, be approved by a majority vote of those present and voting at a regular or special meeting of the local legislative body;  or
