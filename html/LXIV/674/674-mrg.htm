&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:1 Duties of the Planning Board. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be the duty of every planning board established under RSA 673:1 to prepare and amend from time to time a master plan to guide the development of the municipality.  A master plan may include consideration of any areas outside the boundaries of the municipality which in the judgment of the planning board bear a relation to or have an impact on the planning of the municipality.  Every planning board shall from time to time update and amend the adopted master plan with funds appropriated for that purpose by the local legislative body.  In preparing, amending, and updating the master plan:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The planning board shall have responsibility for promoting interest in, and understanding of, the master plan of the municipality.  In order to promote this interest and understanding, the planning board may publish and distribute copies of the master plan, or copies of any report relating to the master plan, and may employ such other means of publicity and education as it may deem advisable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The planning board shall also have authority to make any investigations, maps and reports, and recommendations which relate to the planning and development of the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The planning board may from time to time report and recommend to the appropriate public officials and public agencies programs for the development of the municipality, programs for the erection of public structures, and programs for municipal improvements.  Each program shall include recommendations for its financing.  It shall be part of the planning board's duties to consult with and advise public officials and agencies, public utility companies, civic, educational, professional, research and other organizations, and to consult with citizens, for the purposes of protecting or carrying out of the master plan as well as for making recommendations relating to the development of the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Members of the planning board, when duly authorized by the board as a whole, may attend municipal planning conferences or meetings, or hearings upon pending municipal planning legislation.  The planning board may by majority vote authorize the payment of reasonable expenses incident to such attendance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The planning board, and its members, officers, and employees, in the performance of their functions may, by ordinance, be authorized to enter upon any land and make such examinations and surveys as are reasonably necessary and place and maintain necessary monuments and marks and, in the event consent for such entry is denied or not reasonably obtainable, to obtain an administrative inspection warrant under RSA 595-B.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The planning board may, from time to time, recommend to the local legislative body amendments of the zoning ordinance or zoning map or additions thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In general, the planning board may be given such powers by the municipality as may be necessary to enable it to fulfill its functions, promote municipal planning, or carry out the purposes of this title.  Such powers shall not include regulating timber harvesting operations that are not part of a subdivision application or a development project subject to site plan review under this chapter.

<center><h3>Section 674:2</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:2 Master Plan;  Purpose and Description. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of the master plan is to set down as clearly and practically as possible the best and most appropriate future development of the area under the jurisdiction of the planning board, to aid the board in designing ordinances that result in preserving and enhancing the unique quality of life and culture of New Hampshire, and to guide the board in the performance of its other duties in a manner that achieves the principles of smart growth, sound planning, and wise resource protection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The master plan shall be a set of statements and land use and development principles for the municipality with such accompanying maps, diagrams, charts and descriptions as to give legal standing to the implementation ordinances and other measures of the planning board.  Each section of the master plan shall be consistent with the others in its implementation of the vision section.  The master plan shall be a public record subject to the provisions of RSA 91-A.  The master plan shall include, at a minimum, the following required sections:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A vision section that serves to direct the other sections of the plan.  This section shall contain a set of statements which articulate the desires of the citizens affected by the master plan, not only for their locality but for the region and the whole state.  It shall contain a set of guiding principles and priorities to implement that vision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A land use section upon which all the following sections shall be based.  This section shall translate the vision statements into physical terms.  Based on a study of population, economic activity, and natural, historic, and cultural resources, it shall show existing conditions and the proposed location, extent, and intensity of future land use.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The master plan may also include the following sections:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A transportation section which considers all pertinent modes of transportation and provides a framework for both adequate local needs and for coordination with regional and state transportation plans.  Suggested items to be considered may include but are not limited to public transportation, park and ride facilities, and bicycle routes, or paths, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A community facilities section which identifies facilities to support the future land use pattern of subparagraph II(b), meets the projected needs of the community, and coordinates with other local governments' special districts and school districts, as well as with state and federal agencies that have multi-jurisdictional impacts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An economic development section which proposes actions to suit the community's economic goals, given its economic strengths and weaknesses in the region.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A natural resources section which identifies and inventories any critical or sensitive areas or resources, not only those in the local community, but also those shared with abutting communities.  This section provides a factual basis for any land development regulations that may be enacted to protect natural areas.  A key component in preparing this section is to identify any conflicts between other elements of the master plan and natural resources, as well as conflicts with plans of abutting communities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A natural hazards section which documents the physical characteristics, severity, frequency, and extent of any potential natural hazards to the community.  It should identify those elements of the built environment at risk from natural hazards as well as extent of current and future vulnerability that may result from current zoning and development policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A recreation section which shows existing recreation areas and addresses future recreation needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A utility and public service section analyzing the need for and showing the present and future general location of existing and anticipated public and private utilities, both local and regional, including telecommunications utilities, their supplies, and facilities for distribution and storage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) A section which identifies cultural and historic resources and protects them for rehabilitation or preservation from the impact of other land use tools such as land use regulations, housing, or transportation.  Such section may encourage the preservation or restoration of stone walls, provided agricultural practices, as defined in RSA 21:34-a, are not impeded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A regional concern section, which describes the specific areas in the municipality of significant regional interest.  These areas may include resources wholly contained within the municipality or bordering, or shared, or both, with neighboring municipalities.  Items to be considered may include but are not limited to public facilities, natural resources, economic and housing potential, transportation, agriculture, and open space.  The intent of this section is to promote regional awareness in managing growth while fulfilling the vision statements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A neighborhood plan section which focuses on a specific geographical area of local government that includes substantial residential development.  This section is a part of the local master plan and shall be consistent with it.  No neighborhood plan shall be adopted until a local master plan is adopted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) A community design section to identify positive physical attributes in a municipality and provide for design goals and policies for planning in specific areas to guide private and public development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) A housing section which assesses local housing conditions and projects future housing needs of residents of all levels of income and ages in the municipality and the region as identified in the regional housing needs assessment performed by the regional planning commission pursuant to RSA 36:47, II, and which integrates the availability of human services with other planning undertaken by the community.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) An implementation section, which is a long range action program of specific actions, time frames, allocation of responsibility for actions, description of land development regulations to be adopted, and procedures which the municipality may use to monitor and measure the effectiveness of each section of the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) An energy section, which includes an analysis of energy and fuel resources, needs, scarcities, costs, and problems affecting the municipality and a statement of policy on the conservation of energy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:10 Establishment of Official Map. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
After the planning board of any municipality has adopted a master plan which includes a major street plan, or has progressed in its master planning to the stage of the making and adoption of a major street plan, and has certified a copy of a major street plan to the local legislative body, as provided in RSA 674:9, the local legislative body is hereby empowered and authorized to establish an official map of the municipality showing the location of the exterior lines of streets of the whole or of any parts of the municipality up to that time existing, laid out and established by law as public streets, and may also show the location of the exterior lines of parks.  The official map is to be deemed to be final and conclusive with respect to the location and width of streets and the location of parks shown thereon.  The official map established under this section shall be established to conserve and promote the public health, safety, convenience or general welfare.  The ordinance establishing or adopting the official map shall provide that a certificate, signed by the city or town clerk, the village district clerk, or other duly authorized recording official, giving notice that the municipality has established an official map, including the date of its establishment, shall be filed with the register of deeds of the county or counties in which the municipality is situated.  Such certificates shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the official map as adopted or established.  Whenever a municipality has established an official map and has filed a certificate to that effect, together with a copy of the official map, with the register of deeds for the county or counties in which the municipality is situated, then no plat of a subdivision of land within the municipality shall thereafter be filed or recorded at the office of the register of deeds until it has been approved by the planning board and such approval entered in writing on the plat by the chairperson or secretary of the planning board.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:11 Amendments to Official Map. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The local legislative body is authorized and empowered, whenever and as often as it may deem it advisable or necessary for the public interest, to change or add to the official map of the municipality.  Amendments may be made in order to establish the exterior lines of the new streets or parks, or to widen, extend, relocate, narrow, vacate, abandon, or close existing streets or parks, and to indicate the acceptance of, change of use, acquisition of land for, or sale or lease of any street or other public way, ground, place, property, or structure.  No change shall become effective until after a public hearing has been held on the change, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have had an opportunity to be heard.  Notice of the public hearing shall be given by publishing at least 10 days before the public hearing a notice of such hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, and by posting a notice to the same effect at the city or town hall, or in whatever place other notices required by law in connection with municipal affairs are posted or customarily displayed.  Before making such addition, amendment, or change, the local legislative body shall refer the matter to the planning board for a report.  If the planning board does not make its report within 30 days of such reference, it shall be deemed to have forfeited the right to further suspend action.  In the event that the planning board disapproves the proposed addition, amendment, or change, the local legislative body shall not have the right to overrule the planning board's decision, unless by vote of not less than  2/3 of its entire membership in case of a city, or by majority vote of the legal voters present and voting at a regular or special town or district meeting in the case of a town or village district.  Such additions, amendments, and changes when adopted shall become a part of the official map of the municipality and shall be deemed to be final and conclusive with respect to the location of the streets and parks shown on the official map.  The locating, widening, narrowing, or closing, or the approval of locating, widening, narrowing, or closing, of streets and parks by the municipality under provisions of law other than those contained in this subdivision shall be deemed to be a change or addition to the official map and shall be subject to all the provisions of this subdivision.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to RSA 674:16 shall provide that the board of adjustment created under a local zoning ordinance and having the power to make variances or exceptions in zoning regulations shall have the further power, in specific cases and by vote of a majority of its members, upon an appeal filed with it by the owner of any such land, to grant a permit based on considerations of justice and equity for a building or structure, or part thereof, in a mapped-street location shown on the official map, in any case in which the board of adjustment finds, upon the evidence and arguments presented to it upon appeal:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the property of the appellant of which such mapped-street location forms a part will not yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such permit be granted;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That, balancing the interest of the municipality in preserving the integrity of the official map and in not increasing too greatly the cost of later opening such street, and the interest of the owner in the use and benefits of the owner's property, the grant of such permit is required by considerations of justice and equity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event that the board of adjustment decides to authorize or issue a building permit in such case, it shall have the power to specify the exact location, ground area to be used or occupied, height, and other reasonable details and conditions of extent and character, and also the duration of the building, or part hereof, permitted.  Such requirements shall be designed to promote the health, convenience, safety, or general welfare of and shall inure to the benefit of the municipality.  The board of adjustment shall refuse a permit if the applicant will not be substantially damaged by placing the applicant's building outside the mapped-street location.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:17 Purposes of Zoning Ordinances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every zoning ordinance shall be adopted in accordance with the requirements of RSA 674:18.  Zoning ordinances shall be designed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) To lessen congestion in the streets;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To secure safety from fires, panic and other dangers;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To promote health and the general welfare;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) To provide adequate light and air;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) To prevent the overcrowding of land;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) To avoid undue concentration of population;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) To facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, solid waste facilities, water, sewerage, schools, parks, child day care;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) To assure proper use of natural resources and other public requirements;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) To encourage the preservation of agricultural lands and buildings and the agricultural operations described in RSA 21:34-a supporting the agricultural lands and buildings;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) To encourage the installation and use of solar, wind, or other renewable energy systems and protect access to energy sources by the regulation of orientation of streets, lots, and buildings;  establishment of maximum building height, minimum set back requirements, and limitations on type, height, and placement of vegetation;  and encouragement of the use of solar skyspace easements under RSA 477.  Zoning ordinances may establish buffer zones or additional districts which overlap existing districts and may further regulate the planting and trimming of vegetation on public and private property to protect access to renewable energy systems.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every zoning ordinance shall be made with reasonable consideration to, among other things, the character of the area involved and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, as well as with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in RSA 424:5 or RSA 422-B or in any other provision of Title XXXIX, no city, town, or county in which there are located unincorporated towns or unorganized places shall adopt a zoning ordinance or regulation with respect to antennas used exclusively in the amateur radio service that fails to conform to the limited federal preemption entitled Amateur Radio Preemption, 101 FCC 2nd 952 (1985) issued by the Federal Communications Commission.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:21 Innovative Land Use Controls. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Innovative land use controls may include, but are not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Timing incentives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Phased development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Intensity and use incentive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Transfer of density and development rights.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Planned unit development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Cluster development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Impact zoning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Performance standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Flexible and discretionary zoning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Environmental characteristics zoning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Inclusionary zoning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Accessory dwelling unit standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) Impact fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) Village plan alternative subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An innovative land use control adopted under RSA 674:16 may be required when supported by the master plan and shall contain within it the standards which shall guide the person or board which administers the ordinance.  An innovative land use control ordinance may provide for administration, including the granting of conditional or special use permits, by the planning board, board of selectmen, zoning board of adjustment, or such other person or board as the ordinance may designate.  If the administration of the innovative provisions of the ordinance is not vested in the planning board, any proposal submitted under this section shall be reviewed by the planning board prior to final consideration by the administrator.  In such a case, the planning board shall set forth its comments on the proposal in writing and the administrator shall, to the extent that the planning board's comments are not directly incorporated into its decision, set forth its findings and decisions on the planning board's comments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Innovative land use controls must be adopted in accordance with RSA 675:1, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. As used in this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Inclusionary zoning'' means land use control regulations which provide a voluntary incentive or benefit to a property owner in order to induce the property owner to produce housing units which are affordable to persons or families of low and moderate income.  Inclusionary zoning includes, but is not limited to, density bonuses, growth control exemptions, and a streamlined application process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Accessory dwelling unit'' means a second dwelling unit, attached or detached, which is permitted by a land use control regulation to be located on the same lot, plat, site, or other division of land as the permitted principal dwelling unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. As used in this section "impact fee'' means a fee or assessment imposed upon development, including subdivision, building construction, or other land use change, in order to help meet the needs occasioned by that development for the construction or improvement of capital facilities owned or operated by the municipality, including and limited to water treatment and distribution facilities;  wastewater treatment and disposal facilities;  sanitary sewers;  storm water, drainage and flood control facilities;  municipal road systems and rights-of-way;  municipal office facilities;  public school facilities;  the municipality's proportional share of capital facilities of a cooperative or regional school district of which the municipality is a member;  public safety facilities;  solid waste collection, transfer, recycling, processing, and disposal facilities;  public library facilities;  and public recreational facilities not including public open space.  No later than July 1, 1993, all impact fee ordinances shall be subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount of any such fee shall be a proportional share of municipal capital improvement costs which is reasonably related to the capital needs created by the development, and to the benefits accruing to the development from the capital improvements financed by the fee.  Upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructures, the need for which is not created by new development, shall not be paid for by impact fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In order for a municipality to adopt an impact fee ordinance, it must have enacted a capital improvements program pursuant to RSA 674:5-7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any impact fee shall be accounted for separately, shall be segregated from the municipality's general fund, may be spent upon order of the municipal governing body, shall be exempt from all provisions of RSA 32 relative to limitation and expenditure of town moneys, and shall be used solely for the capital improvements for which it was collected, or to recoup the cost of capital improvements made in anticipation of the needs which the fee was collected to meet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) All impact fees imposed pursuant to this section shall be assessed at the time of planning board approval of a subdivision plat or site plan.  When no planning board approval is required, or has been made prior to the adoption or amendment of the impact fee ordinance, impact fees shall be assessed prior to, or as a condition for, the issuance of a building permit or other appropriate permission to proceed with development.  Impact fees shall be intended to reflect the effect of development upon municipal facilities at the time of the issuance of the building permit.  Impact fees shall be collected at the time a certificate of occupancy is issued.  If no certificate of occupancy is required, impact fees shall be collected when the development is ready for its intended use.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent the municipality and the assessed party from establishing an alternate, mutually acceptable schedule of payment of impact fees in effect at the time of subdivision plat or site plan approval by the planning board.  If an alternate schedule of payment is established, municipalities may require developers to post bonds, issue letters of credit, accept liens, or otherwise provide suitable measures of security so as to guarantee future payment of the assessed impact fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The ordinance shall establish reasonable times after which any portion of an impact fee which has not become encumbered or otherwise legally bound to be spent for the purpose for which it was collected shall be refunded, with any accrued interest.  Whenever the calculation of an impact fee has been predicated upon some portion of capital improvement costs being borne by the municipality, a refund shall be made upon the failure of the legislative body to appropriate the municipality's share of the capital improvement costs within a reasonable time.  The maximum time which shall be considered reasonable hereunder shall be 6 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Unless otherwise specified in the ordinance, any decision under an impact fee ordinance may be appealed in the same manner provided by statute for appeals from the officer or board making that decision, as set forth in RSA 676:5, RSA 677:2-14, or RSA 677:15, respectively.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The ordinance may also provide for a waiver process, including the criteria for the granting of such a waiver.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The adoption of a growth management limitation or moratorium by a municipality shall not affect any development with respect to which an impact fee has been paid or assessed as part of the approval for that development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Neither the adoption of an impact fee ordinance, nor the failure to adopt such an ordinance, shall be deemed to affect existing authority of a planning board over subdivision or site plan review, except to the extent expressly stated in such an ordinance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The failure to adopt an impact fee ordinance shall not preclude a municipality from requiring developers to pay an exaction for the cost of off-site improvement needs determined by the planning board to be necessary for the occupancy of any portion of a development.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, "off-site improvements'' means those improvements that are necessitated by a development but which are located outside the boundaries of the property that is subject to a subdivision plat or site plan approval by the planning board.  Such off-site improvements shall be limited to any necessary highway, drainage, and sewer and water upgrades pertinent to that development.  The amount of any such exaction shall be a proportional share of municipal improvement costs not previously assessed against other developments, which is necessitated by the development, and which is reasonably related to the benefits accruing to the development from the improvements financed by the exaction.  As an alternative to paying an exaction, the developer may elect to construct the necessary improvements, subject to bonding and timing conditions as may be reasonably required by the planning board.  Any exaction imposed pursuant to this section shall be assessed at the time of planning board approval of the development necessitating an off-site improvement.  Whenever the calculation of an exaction for an off-site improvement has been predicated upon some portion of the cost of that improvement being borne by the municipality, a refund of any collected exaction shall be made to the payor or payor's successor in interest upon the failure of the local legislative body to appropriate the municipality's share of that cost within 6 years from the date of collection.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, failure of local legislative body to appropriate such funding or to construct any necessary off-site improvement shall not operate to prohibit an otherwise approved development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Revenue from impact fees imposed upon development and collected by a municipality under RSA 674:21, V for construction of or improvement to municipal road systems may be expended upon state highways within the municipality only for improvement costs that are related to the capital needs created by the development.  Such improvements may include items such as, but not limited to, traffic signals and signage, turning lanes, additional travel lanes, and guard rails.  No such improvements shall be constructed or installed without approval of the state department of transportation.  In no event shall impact fees be used for any improvements to roads, bridges, or interchanges that are part of the interstate highway system.  Nothing in RSA 674:21, V shall be construed as allowing or authorizing additional impact fees merely by virtue of having approved the expenditure of collected fee revenue for construction of or improvement of state highways, nor shall it be construed as allowing the adoption of new impact fees devoted to assessing impacts to state highways.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) No later than 60 days following the end of the fiscal year, any municipality having adopted an impact fee ordinance shall prepare a report listing all expenditures of impact fee revenue for the prior fiscal year, identifying the capital improvement project for which the fees were assessed and stating the dates upon which the fees were assessed and collected.  The annual report shall enable the public to track the payment, expenditure, and status of the individually collected fees to determine whether said fees were expended, retained, or refunded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) In this section, "village plan alternative'' means an optional land use control and subdivision regulation to provide a means of promoting a more efficient and cost effective method of land development.  The village plan alternative's purpose is to encourage the preservation of open space wherever possible.  The village plan alternative subdivision is meant to encourage beneficial consolidation of land development to permit the efficient layout of less costly to maintain roads, utilities, and other public and private infrastructures;  to improve the ability of political subdivisions to provide more rapid and efficient delivery of public safety and school transportation services as community growth occurs;  and finally, to provide owners of private property with a method for realizing the inherent development value of their real property in a manner conducive to the creation of substantial benefit to the environment and to the political subdivision's property tax base.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An owner of record wishing to utilize the village plan alternative in the subdivision and development of a parcel of land, by locating the entire density permitted by the existing land use regulations of the political subdivision within which the property is located, on 20 percent or less of the entire parcel available for development, shall grant to the municipality within which the property is located, as a condition of approval, a recorded easement reserving the remaining land area of the entire, original lot, solely for agriculture, forestry, and conservation, or for public recreation.  The recorded easement shall limit any new construction on the remainder lot to structures associated with farming operations, forest management operations, and conservation uses, and shall specify that the restrictions contained in the easement are enforceable by the municipality.  Public recreational uses shall be subject to the written approval of those abutters whose property lies within the village plan alternative subdivision portion of the project at the time when such a public use is proposed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The submission and approval procedure for a village plan alternative subdivision shall be the same as that for a conventional subdivision.  Existing zoning and subdivision regulations relating to emergency access, fire prevention, and public health and safety concerns including any setback requirement for wells, septic systems, or wetland requirement imposed by the department of environmental services shall apply to the developed portion of a village plan alternative subdivision, but lot size regulations and dimensional requirements having to do with frontage and setbacks measured from all new property lot lines, and lot size regulations, as well as density regulations, shall not apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The total density of development within a village plan alternate subdivision shall not exceed the total potential development density permitted a conventional subdivision of the entire original lot unless provisions contained within the political subdivision's land use regulations provide a basis for increasing the permitted density of development within a village plan alternative subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In no case shall a political subdivision impose lesser density requirements upon a village plan alternative subdivision than the density requirements imposed on a conventional subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the total area of a proposed village plan alternative subdivision including all roadways and improvements does not exceed 20 percent of the total land area of the undeveloped lot, and if the proposed subdivision incorporates the total sum of all proposed development as permitted by local regulation on the undeveloped lot, all existing and future dimensional requirements imposed by local regulation, including lot size, shall not apply to the proposed village plan alternative subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The approving authority may increase, at existing property lines, the setback to new construction within a village plan alternative subdivision by up to 2 times the distance required by current zoning or subdivision regulations, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Within a village plan alternative subdivision, the exterior wall construction of buildings shall meet or exceed the requirements for fire-rated construction described by the fire prevention and building codes being enforced by the state of New Hampshire at the date and time the property owner of record files a formal application for subdivision approval with the political subdivision having jurisdiction of the project.  Exterior walls and openings of new buildings shall also conform to fire protective provisions of all other building codes in force in the political subdivision.  Wherever building code or fire prevention code requirements for exterior wall construction appear to be in conflict, the more stringent building or fire prevention code requirements shall apply.

I. The local legislative body may further exercise the powers granted under this subdivision to regulate and control the timing of development.  Any ordinance imposing such a control may be adopted only after preparation and adoption by the planning board of a master plan and a capital improvement program and shall be based upon a growth management process intended to assess and balance community development needs and consider regional development needs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The local legislative body may adopt a growth management ordinance under this section only if there is a demonstrated need to regulate the timing of development, based upon the municipality's lack of capacity to accommodate anticipated growth in the absence of such an ordinance.  The need to regulate the timing of development shall be demonstrated by a study performed by or for the planning board or the governing body, or submitted with a petition of voters presented under RSA 675:4.  The study shall be based on competent evidence and shall consider the municipality's projected growth rate and the municipality's need for additional services to accommodate such growth.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An ordinance adopted under this section shall include a termination date and shall restrict projected normal growth no more than is necessary to allow for orderly and good-faith development of municipal services.  The planning board in a municipality that adopts such an ordinance shall promptly undertake development of a plan for the orderly and rational development of municipal services needed to accommodate anticipated normal growth;  provided, however, that in a town that has established a capital improvement program committee under RSA 674:5, the plan shall be developed by that committee.  The ordinance and the plan shall be evaluated by the planning board at least annually, to confirm that reasonable progress is being made to carry out the plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:30 Utility Structures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Local ordinances, codes, and regulations enacted pursuant to this title shall apply to public utility structures, provided, however, that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding the provisions of any such local ordinance, code, or regulation, a planning board, or its designee pursuant to paragraph II, upon application by a utility, may waive any requirement contained in an ordinance, code, or regulation for any unoccupied structure which is less than 200 square feet in area, which is necessary for the furnishing of utility service for the public health, safety, or general welfare, and for which the utility's siting options are limited by virtue of said structure being a physically integrated component of the utility's transmission or distribution apparatus.  Any such waiver shall terminate, without further action by the planning board, if said structure ceases to be used for provisions of utility services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The planning board may adopt regulations, pursuant to RSA 675:6 to ensure that such utility structures do not adversely affect the character of the area or create a hazard to the public.  Such regulations may designate the building inspector, municipal engineer, road agent, or other official as agent of the planning board for purposes of this section.  Notice shall be given by the planning board to abutters and the public, according to the procedures provided for in RSA 676:4, I(d), 10 days prior to any decision to be issued under such regulations.  A hearing shall be held, if requested by the applicant or the abutters at any time prior to issuance of the decision, or if the board determines that a hearing is necessary.  Notice of such hearing shall be given as provided in RSA 675:7, and no decision shall be issued until after the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A public utility which uses or proposes to use a structure which does not fit the criteria described in paragraph I, or fits those criteria and has been denied a waiver, or has been granted a waiver with conditions unacceptable to the utility when the waiver was applied for pursuant to paragraph I, may petition the public utilities commission to be exempted from the operation of any local ordinance, code, or regulation enacted under this title.  The public utilities commission, following a public hearing, may grant such an exemption if it decides that the present or proposed situation of the structure in question is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public and, if the purpose of the structure relates to water supply withdrawal, the exemption is recommended by the department of environmental services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except for small power production facilities, as defined in RSA 362-A:1-a, X, and cogeneration facilities, as defined in RSA 362-A:1-a, I-c, owned and operated by a New Hampshire franchised utility, small power production facilities and cogeneration facilities shall not be considered to be public utilities under this section and may not petition the public utilities commission for an exemption from the operation of any regulation under this subdivision.

<center><h3>Section 674:33</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:33 Powers of Zoning Board of Adjustment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The zoning board of adjustment shall have the power to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Hear and decide appeals if it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of any zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to RSA 674:16;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, a variance from the terms of the zoning ordinance if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The variance will not be contrary to the public interest;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The spirit of the ordinance is observed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Substantial justice is done;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The values of surrounding properties are not diminished;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance would result in an unnecessary hardship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) For purposes of this subparagraph, "unnecessary hardship'' means that, owing to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other properties in the area:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) No fair and substantial relationship exists between the general public purposes of the ordinance provision and the specific application of that provision to the property;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) The proposed use is a reasonable one.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) If the criteria in subparagraph (A) are not established, an unnecessary hardship will be deemed to exist if, and only if, owing to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other properties in the area, the property cannot be reasonably used in strict conformance with the ordinance, and a variance is therefore necessary to enable a reasonable use of it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The definition of "unnecessary hardship'' set forth in subparagraph (5) shall apply whether the provision of the ordinance from which a variance is sought is a restriction on use, a dimensional or other limitation on a permitted use, or any other requirement of the ordinance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In exercising its powers under paragraph I, the zoning board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order or decision as ought to be made and, to that end, shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The concurring vote of 3 members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any action of the administrative official or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter on which it is required to pass.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A local zoning ordinance may provide that the zoning board of adjustment, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, make special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance.  All special exceptions shall be made in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance and shall be in accordance with the general or specific rules contained in the ordinance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding subparagraph I(b), any zoning board of adjustment may grant a variance from the terms of a zoning ordinance without finding a hardship arising from the condition of a premises subject to the ordinance, when reasonable accommodations are necessary to allow a person or persons with a recognized physical disability to reside in or regularly use the premises, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any variance granted under this paragraph shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In granting any variance pursuant to this paragraph, the zoning board of adjustment may provide, in a finding included in the variance, that the variance shall survive only so long as the particular person has a continuing need to use the premises.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a lot or other division of land, or structure thereupon, is discovered to be in violation of a physical layout or dimensional requirement imposed by a zoning ordinance enacted pursuant to RSA 674:16, the zoning board of adjustment shall, upon application by and with the burden of proof on the property owner, grant an equitable waiver from the requirement, if and only if the board makes all of the following findings:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the violation was not noticed or discovered by any owner, former owner, owner's agent or representative, or municipal official, until after a structure in violation had been substantially completed, or until after a lot or other division of land in violation had been subdivided by conveyance to a bona fide purchaser for value;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That the violation was not an outcome of ignorance of the law or ordinance, failure to inquire, obfuscation, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of any owner, owner's agent or representative, but was instead caused by either a good faith error in measurement or calculation made by an owner or owner's agent, or by an error in ordinance interpretation or applicability made by a municipal official in the process of issuing a permit over which that official had authority;

(c) That the physical or dimensional violation does not constitute a public or private nuisance, nor diminish the value of other property in the area, nor interfere with or adversely affect any present or permissible future uses of any such property;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

II. In lieu of the findings required by the board under subparagraphs I(a) and (b), the owner may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the violation has existed for 10 years or more, and that no enforcement action, including written notice of violation, has been commenced against the violation during that time by the municipality or any person directly affected.

IV. Waivers shall be granted under this section only from physical layout, mathematical or dimensional requirements, and not from use restrictions.  An equitable waiver granted under this section shall not be construed as a nonconforming use, and shall not exempt future use, construction, reconstruction, or additions on the property from full compliance with the ordinance.  This section shall not be construed to alter the principle that owners of land are bound by constructive knowledge of all applicable requirements.  This section shall not be construed to impose upon municipal officials any duty to guarantee the correctness of plans reviewed by them or property inspected by them.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The planning board of a municipality shall have the authority to regulate the subdivision of land under the enactment procedures of RSA 675:6.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:36 Subdivision Regulations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Before the planning board exercises its powers under RSA 674:35, the planning board shall adopt subdivision regulations according to the procedures required by RSA 675:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The subdivision regulations which the planning board adopts may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide against such scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public services, or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provide for the harmonious development of the municipality and its environs;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Require the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within subdivisions in relation to other existing or planned streets or with features of the official map of the municipality;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Provide for open spaces of adequate proportions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Require suitably located streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and prospective traffic and to afford adequate light, air, and access for firefighting apparatus and equipment to buildings, and be coordinated so as to compose a convenient system;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Require, in proper cases, that plats showing new streets or narrowing or widening of such streets submitted to the planning board for approval shall show a park or parks suitably located for playground or other recreational purposes;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Require that proposed parks shall be of reasonable size for neighborhood playgrounds or other recreational uses;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Require that the land indicated on plats submitted to the planning board shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Prescribe minimum areas of lots so as to assure conformance with local zoning ordinances and to assure such additional areas as may be needed for each lot for on-site sanitary facilities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Include provisions which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, or prosperity;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Encourage the installation and use of solar, wind, or other renewable energy systems and protect access to energy sources by the regulation of orientation of streets, lots, and buildings;  establishment of maximum building height, minimum set back requirements, and limitations on type, height, and placement of vegetation;  and encouragement of the use of solar skyspace easements under RSA 477.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Provide for efficient and compact subdivision development which promotes retention and public usage of open space and wildlife habitat, by allowing for village plan alternative subdivision as defined in RSA 674:21, VI.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) Require innovative land use controls on lands when supported by the master plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) Include provision for waiver of any portion of the regulations.  The basis for any waiver granted by the planning board shall be recorded in the minutes of the board.  The planning board may only grant a waiver if the board finds, by majority vote, that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Specific circumstances relative to the subdivision, or conditions of the land in such subdivision, indicate that the waiver will properly carry out the spirit and intent of the regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The subdivision regulations of the planning board may stipulate, as a condition precedent to the approval of the plat, the extent to which and the manner in which streets shall be graded and improved and to which water, sewer, and other utility mains, piping, connections, or other facilities shall be installed.  The regulations or practice of the planning board:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) May provide for the conditional approval of the plat before such improvements and installations have been constructed, but any such conditional approval shall not be entered upon the plat.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Shall provide that, in lieu of the completion of street work and utility installations prior to the final approval of a plat, the planning board shall accept a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other type or types of security as shall be specified in the subdivision regulations;  provided that in no event shall the exclusive form of security required by the planning board be in the form of cash or a passbook.  As phases or portions of the secured improvements or installations are completed and approved by the planning board or its designee, the municipality shall partially release said security to the extent reasonably calculated to reflect the value of such completed improvements or installations.  Cost escalation factors that are applied by the planning board to any bond or other security required under this section shall not exceed 10 percent per year.  The planning board shall, within the limitations provided in this subparagraph, have the discretion to prescribe the type and amount of security, and specify a period for completion of the improvements and utilities to be expressed in the bond or other security, in order to secure to the municipality the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities.  The municipality shall have the power to enforce such bonds or other securities by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) May provide that in lieu of the completion of street work and utility installations prior to the final approval of the plat, the subdivision regulations may provide for an assessment or other method by which the municipality is put in an assured position to do said work and to make said alterations at the cost of the owners of the property within the subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The planning board shall not require, or adopt any regulation requiring, the installation of a fire suppression sprinkler system in proposed one- or 2-family residences as a condition of approval for a local permit.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a duly adopted regulation mandating a cistern, dry hydrant, fire pond, or other credible water source other than a fire suppression sprinkler system.

<center><h3>Section 674:37-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:37-a Effect of Subdivision on Tax Assessment and Collection. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The collection of taxes with respect to land being subdivided shall be governed by the following provisions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If approval of a subdivision plat has been granted on or before April 1 of a particular tax year, giving the owner a legal right to sell or transfer the lots, parcels or other divisions of land depicted on the plat without further approval or action by the municipality, then such lots or parcels shall for that tax year be assessed and appraised as separate estates pursuant to RSA 75:9, whether or not any such sale or transfer has actually occurred, and shall continue to be so assessed unless and until subdivision approval is revoked under RSA 676:4-a, or the parcels are merged pursuant to RSA 674:39-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If subdivision approval does not become final until after April 1, then all assessments, appraisals, and tax warrants for that property during that tax year shall pertain to the entire non-subdivided property as it was configured on April 1, notwithstanding any later sale or transfer of subdivided lots or parcels which may occur during that year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When property has been assessed as a single parcel or estate in accordance with paragraph II, and some subdivided portion of that property is later sold or transferred prior to the payment of all taxes, interest, and costs due for that tax year, the municipality's tax lien shall remain in effect with respect to the entire property, and each lot or parcel transferred or retained shall remain obligated for the entire amount, and shall be subject to all procedures of RSA 80 until that amount is collected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In order to avoid the liability of subdivided lots or parcels for taxes due on the entire property as set forth in paragraph III, any person with a legal interest may, at the time of subdivision approval or any time thereafter, prepay all taxes to be assessed on the entire property for that tax year.  If such prepayment is offered prior to the determination of the property's full tax obligation for that year, the collector shall notify the assessing officials, who shall make a reasonable jeopardy assessment in accordance with the provisions of RSA 76:10-a, and commit it to the collector.  After full prepayment the tax collector shall upon request execute a statement identifying the subdivision plat, and stating that all real estate tax obligations for the tax year have been fulfilled with respect to the property shown on the plat.  Such a statement may be recorded in the registry of deeds at the expense of the party requesting it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the parties to a conveyance from making alternative provisions, through privately-held escrow or other means, for the allocation and satisfaction of tax obligations;  provided, however, that the municipality shall not, with respect to property assessed as a single parcel or estate pursuant to paragraph II, be required to apportion taxes among subdivided lots, or to release any subdivided portion of such property from the municipality's tax lien unless and until the full tax obligation for the assessed property has been satisfied.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every subdivision plat approved by the planning board and properly recorded in the registry of deeds and every site plan approved by the planning board and properly recorded in the registry of deeds, if recording of site plans is required by the planning board or by local regulation, shall be exempt from all subsequent changes in subdivision regulations, site plan review regulations, impact fee ordinances, and zoning ordinances adopted by any city, town, or county in which there are located unincorporated towns or unorganized places, except those regulations and ordinances which expressly protect public health standards, such as water quality and sewage treatment requirements, for a period of 5 years after the date of approval;  provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Active and substantial development or building has begun on the site by the owner or the owner's successor in interest in accordance with the approved subdivision plat within 24 months after the date of approval, or in accordance with the terms of the approval, and, if a bond or other security to cover the costs of roads, drains, or sewers is required in connection with such approval, such bond or other security is posted with the city, town, or county in which there are located unincorporated towns or unorganized places, at the time of commencement of such development;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Development remains in full compliance with the public health regulations and ordinances specified in this section;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At the time of approval and recording, the subdivision plat or site plan conforms to the subdivision regulations, site plan review regulations, and zoning ordinances then in effect at the location of such subdivision plat or site plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Once substantial completion of the improvements as shown on the subdivision plat or site plan has occurred in compliance with the approved subdivision plat or site plan or the terms of said approval or unless otherwise stipulated by the planning board, the rights of the owner or the owner's successor in interest shall vest and no subsequent changes in subdivision regulations, site plan regulations, or zoning ordinances, except impact fees adopted pursuant to RSA 674:21 and 675:2-4, shall operate to affect such improvements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The planning board may, as part of its subdivision and site plan regulations or as a condition of subdivision plat or site plan approval, specify the threshold levels of work that shall constitute the following terms, with due regard to the scope and details of a particular project:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Substantial completion of the improvements as shown on the subdivision plat or site plan,'' for purposes of fulfilling paragraph II;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Active and substantial development or building,'' for the purposes of fulfilling paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Failure of a planning board to specify by regulation or as a condition of subdivision plat or site plan approval what shall constitute "active and substantial development or building'' shall entitle the subdivision plat or site plan approved by the planning board to the 5-year exemption described in paragraph I.  The planning board may, for good cause, extend the 24-month period set forth in subparagraph I(a).

I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Involuntary merger'' and "involuntarily merged'' mean lots merged by municipal action for zoning, assessing, or taxation purposes without the consent of the owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Owner'' means the person or entity that holds legal title to the lots in question, even if such person or entity did not hold legal title at the time of the involuntary merger.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) "Voluntary merger'' and "voluntarily merged'' mean a merger under RSA 674:39-a, or any overt action or conduct that indicates an owner regarded said lots as merged such as, but not limited to, abandoning a lot line.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Lots or parcels that were involuntarily merged prior to September 18, 2010 by a city, town, county, village district, or any other municipality, shall at the request of the owner, be restored to their premerger status and all zoning and tax maps shall be updated to identify the premerger boundaries of said lots or parcels as recorded at the appropriate registry of deeds, provided:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The request is submitted to the governing body prior to December 31, 2016.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No owner in the chain of title voluntarily merged his or her lots.  If any owner in the chain of title voluntarily merged his or her lots, then all subsequent owners shall be estopped from requesting restoration.  The municipality shall have the burden of proof to show that any previous owner voluntarily merged his or her lots.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All decisions of the governing body may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of RSA 676.

VI. Municipalities shall post a notice informing residents that any involuntarily merged lots may be restored to premerger status upon the owner's request.  Such notice shall be posted in a public place no later than January 1, 2012 and shall remain posted through December 31, 2016.  Each municipality shall also publish the same or similar notice in its 2011 through 2015 annual reports.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Shall have been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of, a class V or better highway prior to that time;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A street on a subdivision plat approved by the planning board;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A street on a street plat made by and adopted by the planning board;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A street located and accepted by the local legislative body of the municipality, after submission to the planning board, and, in case of the planning board's disapproval, by the favorable vote required in RSA 674:40;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Is a class VI highway, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The local governing body after review and comment by the planning board has voted to authorize the issuance of building permits for the erection of buildings on said class VI highway or a portion thereof;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The municipality neither assumes responsibility for maintenance of said class VI highway nor liability for any damages resulting from the use thereof;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall produce evidence that notice of the limits of municipal responsibility and liability has been recorded in the county registry of deeds;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The municipality neither assumes responsibility for maintenance of said private roads nor liability for any damages resulting from the use thereof;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall produce evidence that notice of the limits of municipal responsibility and liability has been recorded in the county registry of deeds for the lot for which the building permit is sought;  or

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the enforcement of the provisions of this section would entail practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, and when the circumstances of the case do not require the building, structure or part thereof to be related to existing or proposed streets, the applicant for such permit may appeal from the decision of the administrative officer having charge of the issuance of permits to the zoning board of adjustment in any municipality which has adopted zoning regulations in accordance with RSA 674, or, in municipalities in which no board of adjustment exists, to the local legislative body, or to a board of appeals, whichever is appropriate, in accordance with RSA 674:14 and 674:15, including the requirement for a public hearing.  In a municipality which does not require building permits, direct application may be made to the zoning board of adjustment, or the local legislative body, or the board of appeals for permission to erect the building.  In passing on such appeal or application, the board of adjustment, local legislative body, or board of appeals may make any reasonable exception and shall have the power to authorize or issue a permit, subject to such conditions as it may impose, if the issuance of the permit or erection of the building would not tend to distort the official map or increase the difficulty of carrying out the master plan upon which it is based, and if erection of the building or issuance of the permit will not cause hardship to future purchasers or undue financial impact on the municipality.  Any such decision made in this connection by a board of adjustment, local legislative body, or by a board of appeals pursuant to this section and RSA 674:14 and 674:15 shall be in writing, together with the reasons for the decision, and shall be subject to review in the manner described in RSA 677.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Municipalities may except any lot, including island lots for islands served exclusively by boats, from the requirements of paragraphs I and II by an affirmative vote of the local legislative body pursuant to RSA 675, first submitted to the planning board for its approval and:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If approved by the board, approved by a majority of those present and voting at a regular or special meeting of the local legislative body;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If disapproved by the planning board, approved by not less than  2/3 of those present and voting at a regular or special meeting of the local legislative body.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This section shall supersede any less stringent local ordinance, code or regulation, and no existing lot or tract of land shall be exempted from the provisions of this section except in accordance with the procedures expressly set forth in this section.  For purposes of paragraph I, "the street giving access to the lot'' means a street or way abutting the lot and upon which the lot has frontage.  It does not include a street from which the sole access to the lot is via a private easement or right-of-way, unless such easement or right-of-way also meets the criteria set forth in subparagraphs I(a), (b), (c), (d), or (e).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition to the requirements for the erection of buildings in paragraph I and notwithstanding the exceptions provided in paragraph II, the planning board for a county in which there are located unincorporated towns or unorganized places shall require every building which is erected on leased land located within an unincorporated town or unorganized place to have a building permit.  A building permit shall be required under this paragraph regardless of the proximity of the building to any street or highway.  The county shall, by resolution, authorize the planning board to issue building permits under this paragraph.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:43 Power to Review Site Plans. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A municipality, having adopted a zoning ordinance as provided in RSA 674:16, and where the planning board has adopted subdivision regulations as provided in RSA 674:36, may by ordinance or resolution further authorize the planning board to require preliminary review of site plans and to review and approve or disapprove site plans for the development or change or expansion of use of tracts for nonresidential uses or for multi-family dwelling units, which are defined as any structures containing more than 2 dwelling units, whether or not such development includes a subdivision or resubdivision of the site.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The ordinance or resolution which authorizes the planning board to review site plans shall make it the duty of the city clerk, town clerk, village district clerk or other appropriate recording official to file with the register of deeds of the county in which the municipality is situated a certificate of notice showing that the planning board has been so authorized, giving the date of such authorization.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The local legislative body of a municipality may by ordinance or resolution authorize the planning board to delegate its site review powers and duties in regard to minor site plans to a committee of technically qualified administrators chosen by the planning board from the departments of public works, engineering, community development, planning, or other similar departments in the municipality.  The local legislative body may further stipulate that the committee members be residents of the municipality.  This special site review committee may have final authority to approve or disapprove site plans reviewed by it, unless the local legislative body deems that final approval shall rest with the planning board, provided that the decision of the committee may be appealed to the full planning board so long as notice of appeal is filed within 20 days of the committee's decision.  All provisions of RSA 676:4 shall apply to actions of the special site review committee, except that such a committee shall act to approve or disapprove within 60 days after submissions of applications, subject to extension or waiver as provided in RSA 676:4, I(f).  If a municipality authorizes a site review committee in accordance with this paragraph, the planning board shall adopt or amend its regulations specifying application, acceptance and approval procedures and defining what size and kind of site plans may be reviewed by the site review committee prior to authorizing the committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The local legislative body of a municipality may by ordinance or resolution establish thresholds based on the size of a project or a tract below which site plan review shall not be required.  If a municipality establishes a size limit below which site plan review shall not be required, the planning board shall adopt or amend its regulations to clearly reflect that threshold.  Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the planning board from establishing such thresholds in the absence of action by the legislative body.

I. Before the planning board exercises its powers under RSA 674:43, it shall adopt site plan review regulations according to the procedures required by RSA 675:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The site plan review regulations which the planning board adopts may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide for the safe and attractive development or change or expansion of use of the site and guard against such conditions as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Inadequate drainage or conditions conducive to flooding of the property or that of another;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Inadequate protection for the quality of groundwater;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Undesirable and preventable elements of pollution such as noise, smoke, soot, particulates, or any other discharge into the environment which might prove harmful to persons, structures, or adjacent properties;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Inadequate provision for fire safety, prevention, and control.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide for open spaces and green spaces of adequate proportions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Require the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within the site in relation to other existing or planned streets or with features of the official map of the municipality;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Require suitably located streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and prospective traffic and to afford adequate light, air, and access for firefighting apparatus and equipment to buildings, and be coordinated so as to compose a convenient system;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Require that the land indicated on plats submitted to the planning board shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Include such provisions as will tend to create conditions favorable for health, safety, convenience, and prosperity;
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Include provision for waiver of any portion of the regulations. The basis for any waiver granted by the planning board shall be recorded in the minutes of the board.  The planning board may only grant a waiver if the board finds, by majority vote, that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Specific circumstances relative to the site plan, or conditions of the land in such site plan, indicate that the waiver will properly carry out the spirit and intent of the regulations.

IV. The site plan review regulations of the planning board may stipulate, as a condition precedent to the approval of the plat, the extent to which and the manner in which streets shall be graded and improved and to which water, sewer, and other utility mains, piping, connections, or other facilities shall be installed.  The regulations or practice of the planning board:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) May provide for the conditional approval of the plat before such improvements and installations have been constructed, but any such conditional approval shall not be entered upon that plat.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Shall provide that, in lieu of the completion of street work and utility installations prior to the final approval of a plat, the planning board shall accept a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other type or types of security as shall be specified in the site plan review regulations.  The planning board shall have the discretion to prescribe the type and amount of the bond or other security, require satisfactory evidence of the financial ability of any surety or financial institution to pay such bond or other type of security, and specify a period for completion of the improvements and utilities to be expressed in the bond or other security, in order to secure to the municipality the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities.  The municipality shall have the power to enforce such bonds or other securities by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The planning board may, as part of its site plan review regulations, require an applicant to pay all costs for notification of abutters and may provide for the assessment of reasonable fees to cover the board's administrative expenses and costs of special investigation and the review of documents and other matters which may be required by particular applications.

<center><h3>Section 674:53</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:53 Land Affected by Municipal Boundaries. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An owner of contiguous land which is located in more than one municipality may treat a municipal boundary line as an existing boundary between lots, tracts, sites or other divisions of land for purposes of this title unless the existing or proposed use of land or arrangement of structures in one of the municipalities requires and is dependent upon land or improvements located in the other municipality or municipalities in order to fulfill the land use ordinances or regulations of the first municipality with respect to such matters as lot size, density, frontage, uses or accessory uses, set-backs or access, or in order to comply with applicable state or federal regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or approval under this title for the subdivision, development, change of use of, or erection or alteration of any structure upon any lot, tract, site or other division of land whose boundary or portion thereof is a municipal boundary line, or whose sole street access or sole maintained street access is via a private road or class IV, V, or VI highway located in an adjoining municipality, the municipality receiving the application shall inquire in writing to the appropriate administrative officials in the adjoining municipality or municipalities as to the existence of facts or regulations which, under paragraphs I, III, or IV of this section or otherwise, would preclude or affect such subdivision, development, construction, or change of use.  Response shall be made to such inquiries within the period provided by this title for approval or disapproval of the underlying application.  A response which invokes an ordinance or regulation of such adjoining municipality may be appealed in that adjoining municipality in the same manner as any other administrative decision.  An adjoining municipality in which is located an existing private road or class VI highway that serves as an applicant's sole means of fulfilling the street access requirements under RSA 674:41 shall have the same regulatory powers under that statute with respect to that road or highway as if the proposed building or development were located within that same municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An owner of contiguous land in more than one municipality may treat such contiguous land as a single lot, tract, site, or other division of land for purposes of this title, notwithstanding the municipal boundary line, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All uses of land, buildings, or structures shall comply with the regulations or ordinances of the municipality in which they are located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When an owner has fulfilled or proposes to fulfill the requirements of one municipality, through the inclusion of land or improvements located in an adjoining municipality, such owner or the owner's successors shall not thereafter use that land or those improvements in a manner such that those requirements of the first municipality are no longer fulfilled.  This paragraph may be enforced by the municipality whose requirements are to be fulfilled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No plat or plan showing land or streets in more than one municipality in the state shall be deemed approved for purposes of this title unless it has been approved by the planning boards of all included municipalities in which the planning board has been granted authority over approval of that type of plat or plan.  In addition, no plat or plan showing land whose sole street access or sole maintained street access is or is planned to be via a private road or class IV, V, or VI highway located in an adjoining municipality shall be deemed approved for purposes of this title unless it has been approved by the planning board, if any, of that adjoining municipality, provided however that the sole issue which may be addressed or regulated by the adjoining municipality shall be the adequacy of such street access, and the impact of the proposal upon it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. With respect to a proposal for the use of contiguous land in more than one municipality:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The fact that a lot, tract, or site straddles a municipal boundary, or that the requirements of one municipality are proposed to be fulfilled by the use of land or improvements in an adjoining municipality, shall not be the sole grounds for disapproval of any application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A planning board may waive or vary its regulations with respect to access or interior roads in order to provide better harmony with the regulations of an adjoining municipality, whenever strict compliance would be unreasonable in light of the overall design of a proposal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When local land use boards from more than one municipality have jurisdiction over a proposed use, subdivision, or development of property:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The applicant may petition the respective local land use boards of each such municipality to proceed with the application on a joint basis, and upon such petition, joint hearings or meetings shall be held throughout the application process.  However, each board may meet separately to confer and take final action upon the application, but may not condition final approval upon the receipt of information not previously requested at a joint hearing or meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Not less than a quorum of each involved land use board shall attend the joint hearing or meeting, and the members who attend the joint hearing or meeting shall have the authority of the full board over that application.  In the alternative, the full board may attend the joint hearing or meeting.  Each land use board shall be responsible for rendering a decision on the subject matter within its jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The board members present at such a joint meeting or hearing shall select an interim chairperson from among such members, who shall prescribe rules of procedure, subject to alteration by the members present, but consistent with RSA 676.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Whenever a subdivision plat or site plan submitted to a planning board includes land whose only maintained public highway access to the Class I and II highway system is via a Class IV or V highway maintained by another municipality in the state, the local governing body and planning board, if any, of that other municipality shall be deemed "abutters'' for purposes of notice under RSA 676:4.  A planning board may, by regulation, set forth additional circumstances in which notice to adjoining municipalities is required.  A planning board, in determining whether an application satisfies its regulations, may consider the effect of the proposal on adjoining municipalities.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section, "governmental use'' means a use, construction, or development of land owned or occupied, or proposed to be owned or occupied, by the state, university system, the community college system of New Hampshire, or by a county, town, city, school district, or village district, or any of their agents, for any public purpose which is statutorily or traditionally governmental in nature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state, university system, community college system of New Hampshire, county, town, city, school district, or village district shall give written notification to the governing body and planning board, if such exists, of a municipality of any proposed governmental use of property within its jurisdiction, which constitutes a substantial change in use or a substantial new use.  Written notification shall contain plans, specifications, explanations of proposed changes available at the time, a statement of the governmental nature of the use as set forth in paragraph I, and a proposed construction schedule.  Such notification shall be provided at least 60 days prior to the beginning of construction.  Either the governing body or planning board of the municipality may conduct a public hearing relative to the proposed governmental use.  Any such hearing shall be held within 30 days after receipt of notice by the governing body or planning board.  A representative of the governmental entity which provided notice shall be available to present the plans, specifications, and construction schedule, and to provide explanations.  The governing body or planning board may issue nonbinding written comments relative to conformity or nonconformity of the proposal with normally applicable land use regulations to the sponsor of the governmental use within 30 days after the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Any use, construction, or development of land occurring on governmentally owned or occupied land, but which is not a governmental use as defined in paragraph I, shall be fully subject to local land use regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-b. The construction and operation of any solid waste disposal facility on land owned or occupied by any city or town within another city or town shall be subject to local land use regulations to the same extent as if the land were owned and occupied by a private entity.  Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the construction and operation of a solid waste facility on land owned by a solid waste management district formed under RSA 53-A or RSA 53-B or any combination of municipalities authorized by an act of the general court, if the land is located within a city or town that is part of the district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This section shall not apply to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The layout or construction of public highways of any class, or to the distribution lines or transmission apparatus of governmental utilities, provided that the erection of a highway or utility easement across a parcel of land, shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to subdivide the remaining land into 2 or more lots or sites for conveyance for development purposes in the absence of subdivision approval under this title.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "transmission apparatus'' shall not include wireless communication facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The erection, installation, or maintenance of poles, structures, conduits and cables, or wires in, under, or across any public highways under RSA 231, or licenses or leases for telecommunication facilities in, under, or across railroad rights of way.  For purposes of this subparagraph, "structures'' shall not include wireless communications facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the event of exigent circumstances where the delay entailed by compliance with this section would endanger public health or safety, the governor may declare a governmental use exempt from the requirements of this section.

Municipalities may adopt floodplain ordinances either as an amendment to an existing zoning ordinance or as a separate ordinance.  A municipality which adopts a floodplain ordinance which is separate from its zoning ordinance or without otherwise having adopted a zoning ordinance, shall observe all legal and procedural requirements for the floodplain ordinance that would be required for a zoning ordinance, including the creation of a board of adjustment.  If a municipality has adopted a zoning ordinance either before or after the adoption of a floodplain ordinance, the board of adjustment shall be the same for both ordinances.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any fluvial erosion hazard zoning shall be based on delineation of zones consistent with any fluvial erosion hazard protocols established by the department of environmental services in effect on the date of its adoption.  If the planning board of a municipality proposes to adopt, by ordinance or amendment, a fluvial erosion hazard ordinance or an amendment to a fluvial erosion hazard ordinance, the board shall, prior to determining the final form of the ordinance or amendment under RSA 675:2 or RSA 675:3, submit to the department of environmental services a map of all fluvial erosion hazard zones.  The department shall review the map and advise the board within 30 days whether the map and zones are consistent with department protocols.

I. "Affordable'' means housing with combined rental and utility costs or combined mortgage loan debt services, property taxes, and required insurance that do not exceed 30 percent of a household's gross annual income.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Multi-family housing'' for the purpose of workforce housing developments, means a building or structure containing 5 or more dwelling units, each designed for occupancy by an individual household.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Reasonable and realistic opportunities for the development of workforce housing'' means opportunities to develop economically viable workforce housing within the framework of a municipality's ordinances and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter and consistent with RSA 672:1, III-e.  The collective impact of all such ordinances and regulations on a proposal for the development of workforce housing shall be considered in determining whether opportunities for the development of workforce housing are reasonable and realistic.  If the ordinances and regulations of a municipality make feasible the development of sufficient workforce housing to satisfy the municipality's obligation under RSA 674:59, and such development is not unduly inhibited by natural features, the municipality shall not be in violation of its obligation under RSA 674:59 by virtue of economic conditions beyond the control of the municipality that affect the economic viability of workforce housing development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Workforce housing'' means housing which is intended for sale and which is affordable to a household with an income of no more than 100 percent of the median income for a 4-person household for the metropolitan area or county in which the housing is located as published annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.  "Workforce housing'' also means rental housing which is affordable to a household with an income of no more than 60 percent of the median income for a 3-person household for the metropolitan area or county in which the housing is located as published annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Housing developments that exclude minor children from more than 20 percent of the units, or in which more than 50 percent of the dwelling units have fewer than two bedrooms, shall not constitute workforce housing for the purposes of this subdivision.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:59 Workforce Housing Opportunities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In every municipality that exercises the power to adopt land use ordinances and regulations, such ordinances and regulations shall provide reasonable and realistic opportunities for the development of workforce housing, including rental multi-family housing.  In order to provide such opportunities, lot size and overall density requirements for workforce housing shall be reasonable.  A municipality that adopts land use ordinances and regulations shall allow workforce housing to be located in a majority, but not necessarily all, of the land area that is zoned to permit residential uses within the municipality.  Such a municipality shall have the discretion to determine what land areas are appropriate to meet this obligation.  This obligation may be satisfied by the adoption of inclusionary zoning as defined in RSA 674:21, IV(a).  This paragraph shall not be construed to require a municipality to allow for the development of multifamily housing in a majority of its land zoned to permit residential uses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A municipality shall not fulfill the requirements of this section by adopting voluntary inclusionary zoning provisions that rely on inducements that render workforce housing developments economically unviable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A municipality's existing housing stock shall be taken into consideration in determining its compliance with this section.  If a municipality's existing housing stock is sufficient to accommodate its fair share of the current and reasonably foreseeable regional need for such housing, the municipality shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subdivision and RSA 672:1, III-e.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Paragraph I shall not be construed to require municipalities to allow workforce housing that does not meet reasonable standards or conditions of approval related to environmental protection, water supply, sanitary disposal, traffic safety, and fire and life safety protection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:60 Procedure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who applies to a land use board for approval of a development that is intended to qualify as workforce housing under this subdivision shall file a written statement of such intent as part of the application.  The failure to file such a statement shall constitute a waiver of the applicant's rights under RSA 674:61, but shall not preclude an appeal under other applicable laws.  In any appeal where the applicant has failed to file the statement required by this paragraph, the applicant shall not be entitled to a judgment on appeal that allows construction of the proposed development, or otherwise permits the proposed workforce housing development to proceed despite its nonconformance with the municipality's ordinances or regulations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a land use board approves an application to develop workforce housing subject to conditions or restrictions, it shall notify the applicant in writing of such conditions and restrictions and give the applicant an opportunity to establish the cost of complying with the conditions and restrictions and the effect of compliance on the economic viability of the proposed development.  The board's notice to the applicant of the conditions and restrictions shall constitute a conditional approval solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of RSA 676:4, I(c)(1).  It shall not constitute a final decision for any other purpose, including the commencement of any applicable appeal period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon receiving notice of conditions and restrictions under paragraph II, the applicant may submit evidence to establish the cost of complying with the conditions and restrictions and the effect on economic viability within the period directed by the board, which shall not be less than 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon receipt of such evidence from the applicant, the board shall allow the applicant to review the evidence at the board's next meeting for which 10 days' notice can be given, and shall give written notice of the meeting to the applicant at least 10 days in advance.  At such meeting, the board may also receive and consider evidence from other sources.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board may affirm, alter, or rescind any or all of the conditions or restrictions of approval after such meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Subject to subparagraph (d), the board shall not issue its final decision on the application before such meeting, unless the applicant fails to submit the required evidence within the period designated by the board, in which case it may issue its final decision any time after the expiration of the period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If an applicant notifies the board in writing at any time that the applicant accepts the conditions and restrictions of approval, the board may issue its final decision without further action under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A municipality may require that an applicant record restrictive covenants acceptable to the land use board that the workforce housing may not be rented to or sold to any household whose income is greater than that specified in RSA 674:58, IV.  The covenant shall be for the term specified in the regulations of the land use board.  The municipality may adopt regulations to insure compliance with the covenants, which regulations may include requirements for the monitoring of the project by the municipality or by a suitable third party agency qualified to carry out such requirements, including but not limited to requiring the production of annual income verification for renters and non-owner occupiers.  The land use board may consider the existence of recorded covenants or income qualification and occupancy criteria as satisfying the purpose of this paragraph if such covenants or criteria are administered by a state or federal entity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:61 Appeals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person who has filed the written notice required by RSA 674:60, and whose application to develop workforce housing is denied or is approved with conditions or restrictions which have a substantial adverse effect on the viability of the proposed workforce housing development may appeal the municipal action to the superior court under RSA 677:4 or RSA 677:15 seeking permission to develop the proposed workforce housing.  The petition to the court shall set forth how the denial is due to the municipality's failure to comply with the workforce housing requirements of RSA 674:59 or how the conditions or restrictions of approval otherwise violate such requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A hearing on the merits of the appeal shall be held within 6 months of the date on which the action was filed unless counsel for the parties agree to a later date, or the court so orders for good cause.  If the court determines that it will be unable to meet this requirement, at the request of either party it shall promptly appoint a referee to hear the appeal within 6 months.  Referees shall be impartial, and shall be chosen on the basis of qualifications and experience in planning and zoning law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event the decision of the court or referee grants the petitioner a judgment that allows construction of the proposed development or otherwise orders that the proposed development may proceed despite its nonconformance with local regulations, conditions, or restrictions, the court or referee shall direct the parties to negotiate in good faith over assurances that the project will be maintained for the long term as workforce housing.  The court or referee shall retain jurisdiction and upon motion of either party affirming that negotiations are deadlocked, the court or referee shall hold a further hearing on the appropriate term and form of use restrictions to be applied to the project.
