&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 674:9 Mapping of Street Lines by Planning Board. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
At any time after a planning board has adopted a master plan of the municipality which includes a major street plan or has progressed in its master planning to the stage of the making and adoption of a major street plan, the local legislative body may authorize the planning board to make or cause to be made from time to time surveys for the exact locating of the lines of new, extended, widened, or narrowed streets in the whole or in any portion of the municipality.  The local legislative body may also empower the planning board to make and certify to the local legislative body, when completed, a plat of the area thus surveyed on which are indicated the locations of the lines recommended by the planning board as the planned or mapped lines of future streets, street extensions, street widenings, or street narrowings.  The making or certifying of a plat by the planning board, under the authorization of the local legislative body, shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street or the taking or acceptance of any land for street purposes.
