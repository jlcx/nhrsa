&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a lot or other division of land, or structure thereupon, is discovered to be in violation of a physical layout or dimensional requirement imposed by a zoning ordinance enacted pursuant to RSA 674:16, the zoning board of adjustment shall, upon application by and with the burden of proof on the property owner, grant an equitable waiver from the requirement, if and only if the board makes all of the following findings:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the violation was not noticed or discovered by any owner, former owner, owner's agent or representative, or municipal official, until after a structure in violation had been substantially completed, or until after a lot or other division of land in violation had been subdivided by conveyance to a bona fide purchaser for value;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That the violation was not an outcome of ignorance of the law or ordinance, failure to inquire, obfuscation, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of any owner, owner's agent or representative, but was instead caused by either a good faith error in measurement or calculation made by an owner or owner's agent, or by an error in ordinance interpretation or applicability made by a municipal official in the process of issuing a permit over which that official had authority;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That the physical or dimensional violation does not constitute a public or private nuisance, nor diminish the value of other property in the area, nor interfere with or adversely affect any present or permissible future uses of any such property;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) That due to the degree of past construction or investment made in ignorance of the facts constituting the violation, the cost of correction so far outweighs any public benefit to be gained, that it would be inequitable to require the violation to be corrected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In lieu of the findings required by the board under subparagraphs I(a) and (b), the owner may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the violation has existed for 10 years or more, and that no enforcement action, including written notice of violation, has been commenced against the violation during that time by the municipality or any person directly affected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Application and hearing procedures for equitable waivers under this section shall be governed by RSA 676:5 through 7.  Rehearings and appeals shall be governed by RSA 677:2 through 14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Waivers shall be granted under this section only from physical layout, mathematical or dimensional requirements, and not from use restrictions.  An equitable waiver granted under this section shall not be construed as a nonconforming use, and shall not exempt future use, construction, reconstruction, or additions on the property from full compliance with the ordinance.  This section shall not be construed to alter the principle that owners of land are bound by constructive knowledge of all applicable requirements.  This section shall not be construed to impose upon municipal officials any duty to guarantee the correctness of plans reviewed by them or property inspected by them.
