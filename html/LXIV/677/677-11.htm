&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 677:11 Judgment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The final judgment upon every appeal shall be a decree dismissing the appeal, or vacating the order or decision complained of in whole or in part, as the case may be;  but, in case such order or decision is wholly or partly vacated, the court may also, in its discretion, remand the matter to the zoning board of adjustment or local legislative body for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with the decree, as justice may require.
