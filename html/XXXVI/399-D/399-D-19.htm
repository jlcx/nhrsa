(b) Transmit a written explanation or clarification to the consumer and the banking department which sets forth, to the extent applicable, the reasons why the licensee believes its actions are correct, including copies of documentary evidence thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A licensee who fails to respond to consumer complaints within the time prescribed by this section shall pay to the commissioner the sum of $50 for each day such response is overdue.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Licensees which, because of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the licensee, are unable to comply with the time limits prescribed in this section, may make written request to the commissioner for a waiver of such time frames.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
