<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall examine the condition and affairs of each licensee at least every 18 months.  The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a debt adjuster, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The banking department may examine the business affairs of any licensee or any other person, whether licensed or not, as it deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted under it and with the federal acts and regulations to which it is subject, including the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.  In determining compliance, the banking department may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents or matters of any licensee or person.  The banking department shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceedings, and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, and other documents and materials relevant to its investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter, the banking department may examine the records of any licensee and of any person by whom a debt adjustment contract is made, whether such person shall be licensed to act, or claim to act, as principal, agent, or other representative, or under, or without the authority of this chapter;  and for that purpose, the banking department shall have access to the books, papers, records, files, and vaults of all such persons.  The banking department shall also have authority to examine, under oath, all persons whose testimony it may require relative to such contracts or business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The licensee shall maintain such records as will enable the banking department to determine whether the licensee's business is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted under it, with the provisions of applicable federal laws and regulations.  The affairs and records of every licensee shall be subject at any time to such periodic, special, regular, or other examination by the banking department, with or without notice to the licensee.  All books, papers, files, related material, and records of assets of the licensee shall be subject to the banking department's examination.  Such records shall be maintained and made available for examination at the licensee's principal office or its branch office location or the office of its New Hampshire agent for a period of at least 7 years, the last 3 years of which must be in a readily accessible location.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Licensees that maintain their files in another state are required to return such files to their New Hampshire office, to the banking department, or to the office of their New Hampshire agent as named in the license application as amended.  Such licensees are required to return all files and records no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the banking department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the banking department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any agent of the banking department may make a thorough examination into the business affairs of each licensee and shall report any violations of law, rule, or standard business practice to the banking department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The expense of such examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the licensee.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for the cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination, shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Every person being examined and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners, the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes and set forth in writing the remedial course of action which the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in paragraph IX, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in paragraph IX. The report shall be accepted and filed within 6 months after the final hearing thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. All reports pursuant to this section shall be absolutely privileged and although filed in the department as provided in paragraph X shall nevertheless not be for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be deemed confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The commissioner may share information with state and federal regulators, and may share information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of criminal investigations.
