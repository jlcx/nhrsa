(c) Every bond shall provide that no recovery may be made against the bond unless the state makes a claim for recovery or the person brings suit naming the principal within 6 years after the act upon which the recovery or suit is based.  The obligations of the surety shall survive the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization of the licensee, including, without limitation, any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization commenced by or against the licensee under any applicable state or federal law, including the United States Bankruptcy Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The plaintiff, who may be the attorney general in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him or her, immediately sends a notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at such person's last address on file with the commissioner;  and
