<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each bond shall remain in effect until the surety is released from liability by the commissioner, or until the bond is canceled by the surety.  Any surety may cancel a bond upon 30 days' written notice to the commissioner, but no such cancellation shall affect any liability which arises prior to the termination of such 30-day period.  Upon the cancellation of a bond by a surety, the licensee shall file a new bond with the commissioner or the license shall be automatically suspended at the end of such 30-day period.
<br>

I. The commissioner may issue an order requiring a person to whom any license has been granted or any person under the commissioner's jurisdiction to show cause why the license should not be revoked or penalties should not be imposed, or both, for violations of this chapter.  The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license or application pending final determination of any order to show cause, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or licensee that it has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing.  Valid delivery of such order shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the licensee or respondent or to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the licensee or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested, shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner, after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  The commissioner may by order, upon due notice and opportunity for a hearing, assess penalties, deny, suspend, and revoke a license or application, and bar any person from licensure if it is in the public interest, or any combination of the foregoing and the applicant, licensee or respondent, any partner, officer, member, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, licensee or respondent:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Has made a false or misleading statement to the commissioner or in any reports to the commissioner;
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Is not qualified on the basis of such factors as experience, knowledge, and financial integrity;
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(l) Has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(q) For other good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The banking department may, upon due notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend any license for a period not exceeding 30 days, pending investigation by the banking department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any license revocation, license suspension, or unfavorable action by the banking department on a license shall comply with the provisions of RSA 541-A:30.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An aggrieved licensee may, pursuant to RSA 541-A:30 and RSA 541, appeal unfavorable action by the banking department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The banking department may take action for immediate suspension of a license, pursuant to RSA 541-A:30, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a licensee is a partnership, association, corporation, or entity however organized, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership has so acted or failed to act on behalf of said licensee as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.  Each licensee shall be responsible for supervision of its branch offices and for the acts of any or all of its employees while acting as its agent if such licensee, after actual knowledge of said acts, retained the benefits, proceeds, profits, or advantages accruing from said acts or otherwise ratified said acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the commissioner finds that any licensee or applicant for license is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a debt adjuster, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order revoke the license, impose penalties, or deny the application.  The commissioner may deem abandoned and withdraw any application for licensure made pursuant to this chapter, if the applicant fails to respond in writing within 180 calendar days to a written request from the commissioner requesting a response.  Such request shall be sent via certified mail to the last known address of the applicant that is on file with the commissioner.

Fees shall be amortized equally each month over the length of the contract and no licensee shall be entitled to any fee until the contract has been in full force for 30 days and thereafter the monthly amortized amount may be applied to charges at 30-day intervals, while the contract is in full force and effect, except in the event of prepayment or cancellation.

A contract shall not be effective until a debtor has made a payment to the licensee for distribution to his creditors or the debtor has otherwise made a payment to a creditor in accordance with the contract.  The licensee may request a deposit not to exceed $25 upon the signing of the contract.  Said deposit shall be held in escrow by the licensee.  In the event that the debtor fulfills the conditions of the contract, the deposit shall be returned.  In the event that the debtor fails to make payment in accordance with the contract for a period in excess of 60 days, the deposit shall be forfeited.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A licensee shall not receive any fee unless he or she has the written consent of such number of creditors as hold obligations representing at least 25 percent of the total amount of indebtedness and 25 percent of the total number of the creditors listed in the licensee's contract with the debtor, or unless a like number of creditors have accepted a distribution of payment.  Creditors or their attorneys shall have access to all records relative to such consent for verification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The fees received by a licensee shall be based on the amount required to pay indebtedness and shall not exceed:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 399-D:22 Examinations and Investigations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall examine the condition and affairs of each licensee at least every 18 months.  The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a debt adjuster, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The banking department may examine the business affairs of any licensee or any other person, whether licensed or not, as it deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted under it and with the federal acts and regulations to which it is subject, including the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.  In determining compliance, the banking department may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents or matters of any licensee or person.  The banking department shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceedings, and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, and other documents and materials relevant to its investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter, the banking department may examine the records of any licensee and of any person by whom a debt adjustment contract is made, whether such person shall be licensed to act, or claim to act, as principal, agent, or other representative, or under, or without the authority of this chapter;  and for that purpose, the banking department shall have access to the books, papers, records, files, and vaults of all such persons.  The banking department shall also have authority to examine, under oath, all persons whose testimony it may require relative to such contracts or business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The licensee shall maintain such records as will enable the banking department to determine whether the licensee's business is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted under it, with the provisions of applicable federal laws and regulations.  The affairs and records of every licensee shall be subject at any time to such periodic, special, regular, or other examination by the banking department, with or without notice to the licensee.  All books, papers, files, related material, and records of assets of the licensee shall be subject to the banking department's examination.  Such records shall be maintained and made available for examination at the licensee's principal office or its branch office location or the office of its New Hampshire agent for a period of at least 7 years, the last 3 years of which must be in a readily accessible location.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Licensees that maintain their files in another state are required to return such files to their New Hampshire office, to the banking department, or to the office of their New Hampshire agent as named in the license application as amended.  Such licensees are required to return all files and records no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the banking department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the banking department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any agent of the banking department may make a thorough examination into the business affairs of each licensee and shall report any violations of law, rule, or standard business practice to the banking department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The expense of such examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the licensee.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for the cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination, shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Every person being examined and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners, the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes and set forth in writing the remedial course of action which the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in paragraph IX, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in paragraph IX. The report shall be accepted and filed within 6 months after the final hearing thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. All reports pursuant to this section shall be absolutely privileged and although filed in the department as provided in paragraph X shall nevertheless not be for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be deemed confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The commissioner may share information with state and federal regulators, and may share information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of criminal investigations.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The banking department may issue a cease and desist order against any licensee or person who it has reasonable cause to believe is in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Delivery of such order shall be by hand or registered mail at the principal office of the licensee or other person.  The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the rights of the person to request a hearing on the order and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order.  A hearing shall be held not later than 10 days after the request for such hearing is received by the commissioner within 20 days after the date of the hearing the commissioner shall issue a further order vacating the cease and desist order or making it permanent.  All hearings shall comply with RSA 541-A. If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, such person shall be found in default, and the proceeding may be determined against him or her upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be found to be true.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt of such order, then such person shall likewise be found in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If any person refuses to obey the commissioner's order, an action may be brought by the attorney general on the commissioner's behalf in any superior court in this state to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation.  In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding a temporary or permanent injunction, and awarding the commissioner or the attorney general or both costs in bringing such action.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all of the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.
