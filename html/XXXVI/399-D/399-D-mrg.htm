<b>399-D:12 Examinations and Investigations.</b>  --
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized representative shall, in accordance with RSA 383:9 and, with or without notice to the licensee or person, examine the business affairs of any licensee or any other person subject to this chapter, whether licensed or not, or more often when necessary, as the commissioner deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter, the rules adopted pursuant to it and any federal acts and regulations to which it is subject, including the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1601, et seq., as amended.  In determining compliance, the commissioner or the duly authorized representative may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents, whether electronically stored or otherwise, and any other matters of any licensee or person.  The commissioner or the duly authorized representative shall have and be given free access to the office and places of business, files, safes, and vaults of all such persons, and may require the attendance of any person to examine him or her under oath relative to such debt adjustment activity or such business or to the subject matter of any examination or investigation and may require the production of books, records, files, accounts, and papers of such persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or part of a report of examination of a debt adjuster, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department may subpoena witnesses and administer oaths and compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, and other documents and materials whether electronically stored or otherwise relevant to its investigation at any time in any matter over which the department has jurisdiction, control, or supervision pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or the commissioner's examiners the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The expense of such examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the licensee or person being examined.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for the cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination shall be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Those licensees or persons that maintain their files and business documents in another state shall appoint a New Hampshire agent and shall return such files and documents to their principal New Hampshire office, the banking department, or the office of their New Hampshire agent for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and shall return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days that the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial, or other penalties under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized representative may investigate at any time any person that the commissioner reasonably believes is engaged in the business of debt adjustment, or is participating in such business as principal, agent, broker, or otherwise, or any person who the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe is violating or is about to violate any provision of this chapter, or any rule or order under this chapter, whether such person shall claim to be within the authority or beyond the scope of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In any investigation to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, upon the commissioner's finding that the person violated this chapter or a rule or order under this chapter, or the person charged with the violation defaults, the commissioner may recover the cost of the investigation, in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the commissioner or examiner finds any accounts or records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records or accounting after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. (a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in subparagraph (a), or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, thereto as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in subparagraph (a).  The report shall in any event be so accepted and filed within 6 months after final hearing thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. All reports pursuant to this section shall be confidential and shall not be available for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The commissioner may share information with state and federal regulators, and may share information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of criminal investigations.

The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license or application pending final determination of any order to show cause, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or licensee that it has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing.  Valid delivery of such order shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the licensee or respondent or to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the licensee or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested, shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner, after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  The commissioner may by order, upon due notice and opportunity for a hearing, assess penalties, deny, suspend, and revoke a license or application, and bar any person from licensure if it is in the public interest, or any combination of the foregoing and the applicant, licensee or respondent, any partner, officer, member, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, licensee or respondent:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Has made a false or misleading statement to the commissioner or in any reports to the commissioner;
<br>

(f) Has failed to supervise its agents, managers, or employees;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

II. The banking department may, upon due notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend any license for a period not exceeding 30 days, pending investigation by the banking department.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The banking department may take action for immediate suspension of a license, pursuant to RSA 541-A:30, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If a licensee is a partnership, association, corporation, or entity however organized, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership has so acted or failed to act on behalf of said licensee as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.  Each licensee shall be responsible for supervision of its branch offices and for the acts of any or all of its employees while acting as its agent if such licensee, after actual knowledge of said acts, retained the benefits, proceeds, profits, or advantages accruing from said acts or otherwise ratified said acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If the commissioner finds that any licensee or applicant for license is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a debt adjuster, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order revoke the license, impose penalties, or deny the application.  The commissioner may deem abandoned and withdraw any application for licensure made pursuant to this chapter, if the applicant fails to respond in writing within 180 calendar days to a written request from the commissioner requesting a response.  Such request shall be sent via certified mail to the last known address of the applicant that is on file with the commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 399-D:22 Examinations and Investigations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall examine the condition and affairs of each licensee at least every 18 months.  The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a debt adjuster, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The banking department may examine the business affairs of any licensee or any other person, whether licensed or not, as it deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted under it and with the federal acts and regulations to which it is subject, including the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.  In determining compliance, the banking department may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents or matters of any licensee or person.  The banking department shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceedings, and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, and other documents and materials relevant to its investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter, the banking department may examine the records of any licensee and of any person by whom a debt adjustment contract is made, whether such person shall be licensed to act, or claim to act, as principal, agent, or other representative, or under, or without the authority of this chapter;  and for that purpose, the banking department shall have access to the books, papers, records, files, and vaults of all such persons.  The banking department shall also have authority to examine, under oath, all persons whose testimony it may require relative to such contracts or business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The licensee shall maintain such records as will enable the banking department to determine whether the licensee's business is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted under it, with the provisions of applicable federal laws and regulations.  The affairs and records of every licensee shall be subject at any time to such periodic, special, regular, or other examination by the banking department, with or without notice to the licensee.  All books, papers, files, related material, and records of assets of the licensee shall be subject to the banking department's examination.  Such records shall be maintained and made available for examination at the licensee's principal office or its branch office location or the office of its New Hampshire agent for a period of at least 7 years, the last 3 years of which must be in a readily accessible location.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Licensees that maintain their files in another state are required to return such files to their New Hampshire office, to the banking department, or to the office of their New Hampshire agent as named in the license application as amended.  Such licensees are required to return all files and records no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the banking department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the banking department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any agent of the banking department may make a thorough examination into the business affairs of each licensee and shall report any violations of law, rule, or standard business practice to the banking department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The expense of such examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the licensee.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for the cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination, shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Every person being examined and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners, the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes and set forth in writing the remedial course of action which the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in paragraph IX, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in paragraph IX. The report shall be accepted and filed within 6 months after the final hearing thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. All reports pursuant to this section shall be absolutely privileged and although filed in the department as provided in paragraph X shall nevertheless not be for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be deemed confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection.

Every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under this section, every partner, principal executive officer or director of such person, every person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, every employee of such person who materially aids in the act constituting the violation, and every licensee or person acting as a common law agent who materially aids in the acts constituting the violation, either knowingly or negligently, may, upon notice and opportunity for hearing, and in addition to any other penalty provided for by law, be subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of any registration or license, including the forfeiture of any application fee, or the imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500, or both.  Each of the acts specified shall constitute a separate violation, and such administrative action or fine may be imposed in addition to any criminal or civil penalties imposed.  No person shall be liable under this paragraph who shall sustain the burden of proof that such person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The attorney general on the commissioner's behalf, may, with or without prior administrative action by the commissioner, bring an action against any person in any superior court in this state to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, bar, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted and a receiver may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant's assets.  The court shall not require the commissioner or attorney general to post a bond.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all of the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.  In a proceeding in superior court under this paragraph where the state prevails, the commissioner and the attorney general shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses of investigation, and the court shall include the costs in its final judgment.
