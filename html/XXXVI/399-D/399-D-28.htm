&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Each licensee shall file, under oath, an annual report with the commissioner on or before March 31 of each year concerning its business and operations for the preceding calendar year or license period ending December 31 in the form prescribed by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A person who surrenders, withdraws, or does not renew a license shall file the annual report, as required in subparagraph I(a), notwithstanding the fact that such person is not licensed on the date that the report is due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each licensee shall also file, under oath, its financial statement with the commissioner within 90 days from the date of its fiscal year end.  The financial statement shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall include a balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in owners' equity, a cash flow statement, and note disclosures.  If the financial statement is not audited, a certification statement shall be attached and signed by a duly authorized officer of the licensee.  The certification statement shall state that the financial statement is true and accurate to the best of the officer's belief and knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall publish an analysis of the information required in the licensee's annual report as part of the commissioner's annual report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any licensee failing to file either the annual report or the financial statement required by this section within the time prescribed shall pay to the commissioner a penalty of $25 for each calendar day the annual report or financial statement is overdue up to a maximum penalty of $2,500 per report or statement, and shall be subject to suspension or revocation of its license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition to the annual report and financial statement required by this section, the commissioner may require such regular or special reports as the commissioner deems necessary to the proper supervision of licensees under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A licensee who files an annual report under this section which fails to disclose or materially misstates debt contracts made during the reporting year may, in addition to any other penalty provided by law and after notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to RSA 541-A, be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 and to license revocation or suspension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Each licensee shall keep and use such books and accounting records as are in accord with sound and accepted accounting practices and which enable the commissioner to determine whether the licensee is complying with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any officer, owner, manager or agent of any licensee and any person controlling or having a contract under which he or she has a right to control such a licensee, whether exclusively or otherwise, and any person with executive authority over or in charge of any segment of such a licensee's affairs, shall reply promptly in writing, or in other designated form, to any written inquiry from the commissioner requesting a reply.  The commissioner may require that any communication made to him or her under this section be verified.
