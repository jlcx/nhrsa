&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 399-D:18 License Surrender. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A licensee who ceases to engage in the business of a debt adjuster at any time during a license year for any cause, including but not limited to bankruptcy, license revocation, or voluntary dissolution, shall surrender such license in person or by registered or certified mail to the bank commissioner within 15 calendar days of such cessation, and shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the licensee's market area a notice to such effect.  The bank commissioner shall adopt rules, in accordance with RSA 541-A, relative to such notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter and rules or orders adopted under this section, shall be cause for denial of future license applications and the imposition of penalties under RSA 399-D:24.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Withdrawal of the surrendered license shall become effective 30 days after receipt by the commissioner of the license or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless a revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the withdrawal is filed or a proceeding to revoke or suspend or to impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within 30 days after the license is surrendered.  If a proceeding is pending or instituted, the withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines.  If no proceeding is pending or instituted and the withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under RSA 399-D:13 within one year after the withdrawal became effective and enter a revocation or suspension order as of the last date on which the license was effective.

<b>399-D:18 Powers of the Commissioner.</b>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceeding and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of documents, papers, books, records, files, and other evidence, whether electronically stored or otherwise, before the commissioner in any matter over which the commissioner has jurisdiction, control, or supervision pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.  The commissioner shall have the power to administer oaths and affirmation to any person whose testimony is required.  If any person shall refuse to obey any such subpoena or to give testimony or to produce evidence as required thereby, any justice of the superior court may, upon application and proof of such refusal, order the issuance of a subpoena, or subpoena duces tecum, out of the superior court, for the witness to appear before the superior court to give testimony, and to produce evidence as required thereby.  Upon filing such order in the office of the clerk of the superior court, the clerk shall issue such subpoena, as directed, requiring the person to whom it is directed to appear at the time and place therein designated.  If any person served with any such subpoena shall refuse to obey the same, and to give testimony, and to produce evidence as required thereby, the commissioner may apply to any justice of the superior court who, after proof of such refusal, shall issue such citation, directed to any sheriff, for the arrest of such person, and, upon such person's being brought before such justice, proceed to a hearing of the case.  Any person who refuses to comply with a subpoena shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the administration and enforcement of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may prepare, alter, or withdraw such forms as are necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter, including personal disclosure statements and authorizations to meet the requirements of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may issue, amend, or rescind such orders as are reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may, for good cause shown, abate all or a portion of delinquency penalties assessed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. All actions taken by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall be taken only when the commissioner finds such action necessary or appropriate to the public interest or for the protection of consumers and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In adopting rules, preparing forms, setting standards, and in performing examinations, investigations, and other regulatory functions authorized by the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner may cooperate, and share information pursuant to confidentiality agreements, with regulators in this state and with regulators in other states and with federal regulators in order to implement the policy of this chapter in an efficient and effective manner and to achieve maximum uniformity in the form and content of applications, reports, and requirements for debt adjusters, where practicable.
