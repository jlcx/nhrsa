<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA title loan shall be for an original term of no more than one month.  A title loan lender may allow such loan to be renewed no more than 10 additional periods each equal the original term, provided however, that at each such renewal the borrower must pay at least 10 percent of the loan's original principal balance, in addition to any finance charge owed, to reduce the principal balance outstanding.  If the borrower cannot pay this principal reduction at any renewal, the title loan lender may either:  (i) declare the borrower in default, or (ii) allow the loan to be renewed, provided that the lender shall reduce the current principal amount of the loan by 10 percent of the original principal amount for the purposes of calculating interest thereafter.  This reduction in principal shall continue to be owed by the borrower, but such amount shall not be entitled to accrue interest thereafter.  For the purpose of this section, a renewal is any extension of a title loan for an additional period without any change in the terms of the title loan other than a reduction in principal.  No accrued interest shall be capitalized or added to the principal of the loan at the time of any renewal.<center><p>[RSA 399-A:15 effective January 1, 2016;  see also RSA 399-A:15 set out above.]</p></center><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>399-A:15 Provisions Applicable to All Persons Under This Chapter.</b>  --<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI.

This chapter, or any part thereof may be modified, amended, or repealed so as to effect a cancellation or alteration of any license, or right of a licensee hereunder, provided that such modification, amendment, or repeal shall not impair or affect the obligation of any pre-existing lawful contracts between any licensee and any borrowers.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. No interest shall be paid, deducted, or received in advance.  Interest shall not be compounded and interest shall be computed only on unpaid principal balances.  For the purpose of computing interest, whether at the maximum rate or less, a month shall be considered a calendar month and, where a fraction of a month is involved, a day shall be considered  1/30 of a month.  However, if all or any part of the consideration for a loan contract is the unpaid principal balance of the prior loan with the same lender then the loan contract may include unpaid interest of such prior loan which has accrued within 60 days of the making of the loan contract.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. If charges in excess of those permitted by this chapter are charged, contracted for, or received, except as a result of an accidental or bona fide error, the loan contract shall be void and the lender shall have no right to collect or receive any principal, charges, or recompense.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. No licensee shall take any confession of judgment or any power of attorney running to himself, herself, or any third person to confess judgment or to appear for the borrower in a judicial proceeding.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII.

Credit life insurance, credit accident and health insurance, and credit involuntary unemployment insurance may be issued in connection with a loan or other credit transaction authorized by this chapter in compliance with the provisions of RSA 408:15, II and the cost of such insurance and any commission, benefit, or return to the lender therefrom shall not be deemed a violation of any provision of this chapter;  provided, however, that if there is more than one borrower or obligor on any such loan or credit transaction, credit life insurance providing a single benefit may cover both borrowers or obligors.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIII. The lender may require a borrower to insure tangible personal property given to secure the loan against any substantial risk of loss, damage, or destruction for an amount not to exceed the reasonable value of the property insured or the amount of the loan, whichever is less, and for the customary insurance term approximating the term of the loan.  The borrower shall not be required to insure against unusual or exceptional risks not ordinarily insured against in policies issued to nonborrowers.  The premium for such insurance may be included in the principal amount of the loan.  Such insurance shall be written by or through a duly licensed insurance agent or broker with a company qualified to do business in New Hampshire.  Such insurance shall name the borrower as insured but may include the lender as co-insured or protect the interest of the lender under a loss-payable clause.  No lender shall require a borrower to duplicate or cancel existing insurance or to purchase insurance from a lender or any employee, affiliate, or associate of the lender or from any agent, broker, or insurance company designated by the lender, as a condition precedent to the making of the loan.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXIV.
