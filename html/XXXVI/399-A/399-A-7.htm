Each licensee shall be responsible for supervision of its branch offices and for the acts of any or all of its employees while acting as its agent if such licensee, after actual knowledge of such acts, retained the benefits, proceeds, profits, or advantages accruing from such acts or otherwise ratified such acts.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV.
