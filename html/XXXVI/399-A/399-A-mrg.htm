Each applicant and licensee shall maintain a positive net worth at all times.  Each applicant shall demonstrate that it has available for use in such business at each location specified in the application, at least $25,000, or in the case of a licensee, has such amount available or actually invested in loans made under this chapter at each location or has posted a continuous surety bond in the amount of $25,000 in the form and under the terms determined by the commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 399-A:4 Investigation of Application;  License Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the filing of the complete application for a small loan lender license for lending activities including payday loans or title loans and payment of the required application fee, if the commissioner determines that the applicant's financial resources and responsibility, experience, character and general fitness, personnel, and record of past or proposed conduct warrant the public's confidence and that the business will be operated lawfully, honestly, and fairly within the purposes of this chapter, the commissioner shall enter an order approving such application and shall issue a license to the applicant and shall issue licenses to the applicant's branches to engage in the business of a small loan lender including payday loan lender or title loan lender under and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a person holds a valid license under this section and is in compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, such licensee may renew the license by paying the required annual fee of $450 for the principal license and $450 for each branch office to the banking department on or before December 1st for the ensuing year that begins on January 1st.  Failure to renew the license shall result in the license terminating on December 31st.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Each license shall specify the name and address of the licensee and the location of the office or branch, and shall be conspicuously displayed there in a public area of the location.  In case such location is changed, the commissioner shall endorse the change of location on the license without charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No licensee shall transact any business provided for by this chapter under a trade name or any other name different from the name stated in its license or branch office license without immediately notifying the commissioner, who shall then amend the license accordingly.  Before the corporate, organization, or trade name under which the licensed business is conducted is changed, the lender shall give notice to the commissioner who shall amend the license accordingly without cost.  The name or trade name of the licensee shall not be confusing to the public or conflict with any existing licensed lender's name.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No license shall be issued to any person whose principal place of business is located outside of this state unless that person designates an agent residing within this state for service of process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Persons subject to or licensed under this chapter shall abide by applicable federal laws, and regulations promulgated thereunder, including the Federal Truth in Lending Act, and the laws, orders, and rules of this state.  Any violation of such law, rule, or order shall be a violation of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Persons licensed under this chapter are under a continuing obligation to update information on file with the commissioner.  If any information filed with the commissioner becomes materially inaccurate, the licensee shall promptly submit an amendment to its application records that will correct the information on file with the commissioner.  An amendment shall be considered to be filed promptly if the amendment is filed within 30 days of the event that requires the filing of the amendment.  A licensee shall submit written notification to the department of the addition or deletion of a principal, and shall provide the name and address of each new principal no later than 30 days after such change.  Each new principal shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The commissioner shall investigate management and ownership changes including, but not limited to, each principal's qualifications and business history.  The licensee shall investigate and disclose any injunction or administrative order that has been issued against the principal and whether the principal has been convicted of a misdemeanor involving the lending industry or any aspect of the lending business or convicted of any felony, prior to the commissioner's approval of such change.  Certain significant events as defined by rule shall be reported to the department in writing within 10 calendar days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. (a) A licensee who ceases to engage in the business of a small loan lender, payday loan lender, or title loan lender at any time during a license year for any cause, including but not limited to bankruptcy, license revocation, or voluntary dissolution, shall surrender such license in person or by registered or certified mail to the commissioner within 15 calendar days of such cessation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Withdrawal of the surrendered license becomes effective 30 days after receipt of the license by the commissioner or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless a revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the withdrawal is filed or a proceeding to revoke, suspend, or to impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within 30 days after the license is surrendered.  If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines.  If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under RSA 399-A:7 within one year after withdrawal became effective and may enter a revocation or suspension order as of the last date on which the license was effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Failure to comply with the provisions of this section and rules adopted under this section shall be cause for denial of future license applications and the imposition of penalties under RSA 399-A:18.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Any licensee may surrender any license by delivering it to the commissioner with written notice of a surrender, but such surrender shall not affect administrative, civil, or criminal liability for acts committed prior thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The fact that a person is licensed or registered in the state of New Hampshire under this chapter does not constitute a finding that the commissioner has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of such person or that the commissioner has recommended or given approval to any person.  It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Any license fee required by this chapter shall be paid before a license may become effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Any officer, owner, manager or agent of any licensee and any person controlling or having a contract under which he or she has a right to control such a licensee, whether exclusively or otherwise, and any person with executive authority over or in charge of any segment of such a licensee's affairs, shall reply promptly in writing, or in other designated form, to any written inquiry from the commissioner requesting a reply.  The commissioner may require that any communication made to him or her under this section be verified.

The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing, and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license or application pending final determination of any order to show cause, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or licensee that the order has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing.  Valid delivery of such order shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the licensee or respondent or to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the licensee or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested, shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner, after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a licensee is a partnership, association, corporation, or entity however organized, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership has so acted or failed to act on behalf of said licensee as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.  Each licensee shall be responsible for supervision of its branch offices and for the acts of any or all of its employees while acting as its agent if such licensee, after actual knowledge of such acts, retained the benefits, proceeds, profits, or advantages accruing from such acts or otherwise ratified such acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any license revocation, suspension, or unfavorable action by the department on a license shall comply with the provisions of RSA 541-A.  An aggrieved licensee may, pursuant to RSA 541-A and RSA 541, appeal an unfavorable action by the department.  The department may take action for immediate suspension of a license, pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the commissioner finds that any licensee or applicant for license is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a small loan lender, payday loan lender, or title loan lender, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order revoke the license, impose penalties, or deny the application.  The commissioner may deem abandoned and withdraw any application for licensure made pursuant to this chapter, if any applicant fails to respond in writing within 180 calendar days to a written request from the commissioner requesting a response.  Such request shall be sent via certified mail to the last known address of the applicant that is on file with the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No revocation, suspension, or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation of any pre-existing lawful contract between the licensee and any obligors, and such contracts and all lawful charges thereon may be collected by the licensee, its successors, and assigns.

Delivery of such order shall be by hand or registered mail at the principal office of the licensee or other person.  The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the rights of the person to request a hearing on the order and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order.  A hearing shall be held not later than 10 days after the request for such hearing is received by the commissioner after which and within 20 days of the date of the hearing the commissioner shall issue a further order vacating the cease and desist order or making it permanent as the facts require.  All hearings shall comply with RSA 541-A.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, such person shall be deemed in default, and the proceeding may be determined against him or her upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt of such order, then such person shall likewise be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any person refuses to obey the commissioner's order, an action may be brought by the attorney general on the commissioner's behalf in any superior court in this state to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation.  In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding a temporary or permanent injunction, and awarding the commissioner or the attorney general or both costs in bringing such action.  The court shall have the power to enforce such injunction, in addition to all of the court's customary powers, by imposing a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized representative may at any time, and shall periodically, with or without notice to the licensee or person, examine the business affairs of any licensee or any other person subject to this chapter, whether licensed or not, as the commissioner deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to it.  In determining compliance, the commissioner or the duly authorized representative may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents, whether electronically stored or otherwise, and any other matters of any licensee or person.  The commissioner or the duly authorized representative shall have and be given free access to the office and places of business, files, safes, and vaults of all such persons, and shall have authority to require the attendance of any person and to examine him or her under oath relative to such loans or such business or to the subject matter of any examination or investigation and shall have authority to require the production of books, accounts, papers, and records of such persons.  The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or part of a report of examination of a small loan lender, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or the commissioner's examiners the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.  The expense of such examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the licensee or person being examined.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination, shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Those licensees or persons that maintain their files and business documents in another state shall appoint a New Hampshire agent and shall return such files and documents to their principal New Hampshire office, the banking department, or the office of their New Hampshire agent for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial, or other penalties under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized representative may investigate at any time any person that the commissioner reasonably believes is engaged in the business of making small loans, payday loans, or title loans, or participating in such business as principal, agent, broker, or otherwise;  or any person who the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe is violating or is about to violate any provision of this chapter, or any rule or order under this chapter, whether such person shall claim to be within the authority or beyond the scope of this chapter.  Any person not exempt hereunder who shall advertise for, solicit, or hold himself or herself out as willing to make or procure small loans, payday loans, or title loans shall be presumed to be engaged in the business of making such loans.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In any investigation to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, upon the commissioner's finding that the person violated this chapter or a rule or order under this chapter, or the person charged with the violation being found in default, the commissioner shall be entitled to recover the cost of the investigation, in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the commissioner or examiner finds any accounts or records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records or accounting after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any individual who refuses without just cause to be examined under oath or who willfully obstructs or interferes with the examiners in the exercise of their authority pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. (a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in subparagraph (a), or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, thereto as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in subparagraph (a).  The report shall in any event be so accepted and filed within 6 months after final hearing thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All reports pursuant to this section shall be absolutely privileged and although filed in the department as provided in subparagraph (b) shall nevertheless not be for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be deemed confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection.

XI. No charge for any examination, service, brokerage, commission, or other fee shall be directly or indirectly made or contracted for on closed-end loans, payday loans, or title loans except the lawful fees, if any, actually and necessarily paid out by the lender to any public officer, for filing or recording in any public office any instrument securing such loan, which fees may be collected when such loan is made, or at any time thereafter and except the reasonable costs, charges, and expenses, including court costs actually incurred in connection with a repossession of the security or an actual sale of the security in foreclosure proceedings or upon entry of judgment.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the commissioner or examiner finds any accounts or records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records or accounting after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. (a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in subparagraph (a), or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, thereto as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in subparagraph (a).  The report shall in any event be so accepted and filed within 6 months after final hearing thereon.
<br>

This reduction in principal shall continue to be owed by the borrower, but such amount shall not be entitled to accrue interest thereafter.  For the purpose of this section, a renewal is any extension of a title loan for an additional period without any change in the terms of the title loan other than a reduction in principal.  No accrued interest shall be capitalized or added to the principal of the loan at the time of any renewal.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Credit life insurance, credit accident and health insurance, and credit involuntary unemployment insurance may be issued in connection with a loan or other credit transaction authorized by this chapter in compliance with the provisions of RSA 408:15, II and the cost of such insurance and any commission, benefit, or return to the lender therefrom shall not be deemed a violation of any provision of this chapter;  provided, however, that if there is more than one borrower or obligor on any such loan or credit transaction, credit life insurance providing a single benefit may cover both borrowers or obligors.
