<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The APR shall be calculated in accordance with Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z.  Notwithstanding the federal definition of APR, for purposes of calculating APR, the finance charge shall exclude one application fee per borrower per year and one participation or membership fee per borrower per year.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For the purpose of applying paragraphs II and III of this section only, small loan lender shall mean any single small loan lender, except that in the event any person or affiliated group of persons holds more than one small loan lender license, such person or affiliated group of persons shall be considered a single small loan lender.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. No small loan lender shall induce any potential borrower who is not a loan customer of the lender to enter into a closed-end loan agreement, by delivering in the first instance a negotiable check for such loan to such potential borrower, without including the following information clearly printed on the endorsement side of the check:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Mail or deliver to the borrower, or if more than one, to one of them, at the time of making a loan under this chapter, a payment book in which space shall be provided for the record of all payments showing principal, interest, and balance and which shall contain statements showing the date of such loan;  the amount of the principal of such loan;  the total interest charged for the period of such loan;  the nature of the security, if any, for such loan;  the name and address of the borrower and of the lender;  and the description of schedule of payments on such loans.  The payment book shall also have printed therein an interest calculation such as the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"Interpretation of Interest Charges in the Event Payments are Made when Due.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2% per month = 24% per year or $13.47 per year on $100<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1 1/2% per month = 18% per year or $10.01 per year on $100''<br>
<br>
Provided, however, a lender may provide a borrower with a monthly billing statement in lieu of a payment book and the information required above.
<br>

VII. No lender shall conduct the business of making loans under this chapter at any office, suite, room, or place of business where liquor or lottery tickets are sold.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
