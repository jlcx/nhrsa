<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceeding and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of documents, papers, books, records, files, and other evidence, whether electronically stored or otherwise, before the commissioner in any matter over which the commissioner has jurisdiction, control, or supervision pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.  The commissioner shall have the power to administer oaths and affirmation to any person whose testimony is required.  If any person shall refuse to obey any such subpoena or to give testimony or to produce evidence as required thereby, any justice of the superior court may, upon application and proof of such refusal, order the issuance of a subpoena, or subpoena duces tecum, out of the superior court, for the witness to appear before the superior court to give testimony, and to produce evidence as required thereby.  Upon filing such order in the office of the clerk of the superior court, the clerk shall issue such subpoena, as directed, requiring the person to whom it is directed to appear at the time and place therein designated.  If any person served with any such subpoena shall refuse to obey the same, and to give testimony, and to produce evidence as required thereby, the commissioner may apply to any justice of the superior court who, after proof of such refusal, shall issue such citation, directed to any sheriff, for the arrest of such person, and, upon such person's being brought before such justice, proceed to a hearing of the case.  The court shall have power to enforce obedience to such subpoena, and the answering of any question and the production of any evidence that may be proper, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or by both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to the administration and enforcement of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commissioner may prepare, alter, or withdraw such forms as are necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter, including personal disclosure statements and authorizations to meet the requirements of RSA 399-A:3 and RSA 399-A:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner may issue, amend, or rescind such orders as are reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

V. The commissioner may, for good cause shown, abate all or a portion of delinquency penalties assessed under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In adopting rules, preparing forms, setting standards, and performing examinations, investigations, and other regulatory functions authorized by the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner may cooperate, and share information pursuant to confidentiality agreements, with regulators in this state and with regulators in other states and with federal regulators in order to implement the policy of this chapter in an efficient and effective manner and to achieve maximum uniformity in the form and content of applications, reports, and requirements for small loan lenders, where practicable.
