In any investigation to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, upon the commissioner's finding that the person violated this chapter or a rule or order under this chapter, or the person charged with the violation defaults, the commissioner may recover the cost of the investigation, in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIX.

(a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in subparagraph (a), or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, thereto as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in subparagraph (a).  The report shall in any event be so accepted and filed within 6 months after final hearing thereon.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) All reports pursuant to this section shall be confidential and shall not be available for public inspection.
