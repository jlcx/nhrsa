(c) Having any affiliation or other business arrangement with an entity that is exempt from the provisions of this chapter, the effect of which is to evade the provisions of this chapter, including, without limitation, making a loan, while purporting to be the agent of such an exempt entity where the purported agent holds, acquires, or maintains a preponderant economic interest in the revenues generated by the loan.

IV. The fact that a person is licensed or registered in the state of New Hampshire under this chapter shall not constitute a finding that the commissioner has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of such person or that the commissioner has recommended or given approval to any person.  No person shall make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.
