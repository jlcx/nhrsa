III. This chapter shall not apply to any person lawfully engaged in business as permitted by the laws of this state or of the United States relative to banks, trust companies, insurance companies, savings or building and loan associations, or credit unions, or to loans made by them, or to any other person not within the intent of this chapter as the commissioner may designate by rule or order, nor shall this chapter apply to any person engaged solely in the business of making loans for educational purposes or to the loans made by such persons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Any person not exempt under paragraph III, and the several members, officers, directors, agents and employees thereof, who shall willfully violate or participate in the violation of any provisions of paragraph I shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person.
