<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI. The commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized representative may at any time, and shall periodically, with or without notice to the licensee or person, examine the business affairs of any licensee or any other person subject to this chapter, whether licensed or not, as the commissioner deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to it.  In determining compliance, the commissioner or the duly authorized representative may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents, whether electronically stored or otherwise, and any other matters of any licensee or person.  The commissioner or the duly authorized representative shall have and be given free access to the office and places of business, files, safes, and vaults of all such persons, and shall have authority to require the attendance of any person and to examine him or her under oath relative to such loans or such business or to the subject matter of any examination or investigation and shall have authority to require the production of books, accounts, papers, and records of such persons.  The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or part of a report of examination of a small loan lender, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or the commissioner's examiners the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.  The expense of such examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the licensee or person being examined.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination, shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Those licensees or persons that maintain their files and business documents in another state shall appoint a New Hampshire agent and shall return such files and documents to their principal New Hampshire office, the banking department, or the office of their New Hampshire agent for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial, or other penalties under this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. The commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized representative may investigate at any time any person that the commissioner reasonably believes is engaged in the business of making small loans, payday loans, or title loans, or participating in such business as principal, agent, broker, or otherwise;  or any person who the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe is violating or is about to violate any provision of this chapter, or any rule or order under this chapter, whether such person shall claim to be within the authority or beyond the scope of this chapter.  Any person not exempt hereunder who shall advertise for, solicit, or hold himself or herself out as willing to make or procure small loans, payday loans, or title loans shall be presumed to be engaged in the business of making such loans.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. In any investigation to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, upon the commissioner's finding that the person violated this chapter or a rule or order under this chapter, or the person charged with the violation being found in default, the commissioner shall be entitled to recover the cost of the investigation, in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. If the commissioner or examiner finds any accounts or records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records or accounting after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. Any individual who refuses without just cause to be examined under oath or who willfully obstructs or interferes with the examiners in the exercise of their authority pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. (a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in subparagraph (a), or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, thereto as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in subparagraph (a).

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In any investigation to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, upon the commissioner's finding that the person violated this chapter or a rule or order under this chapter, or the person charged with the violation being found in default, the commissioner shall be entitled to recover the cost of the investigation, in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter.

VI. If the commissioner or examiner finds any accounts or records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records or accounting after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any individual who refuses without just cause to be examined under oath or who willfully obstructs or interferes with the examiners in the exercise of their authority pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

VIII. (a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
