<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Any other information that the commissioner may require including, but not limited to, the applicant's form and place of organization, the applicant's proposed method of doing business, the qualifications and business history of the applicant and its principals, and the applicant's financial condition and history.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each initial and renewal license application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $450 for the principal place of business of the licensee and the sum of $450 for each branch of such licensee maintained in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Unless the applicant is a publicly traded corporation, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the applicant's principals.  If the applicant is a subsidiary, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on individuals who are indirect owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The persons described in subparagraph (a) shall submit to the department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The department shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The department may conduct a pre-licensing examination of the applicant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The department may rely on criminal records checks reported through a national licensing system in lieu of subparagraphs (b) and (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Every applicant for licensing shall be required to submit to the banking department detailed financial information sufficient for the commissioner to determine the applicant's ability to conduct the business of a small loan lender, payday lender, or title loan lender with financial integrity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The application shall include a financial statement that shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall include a balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in owner's equity, a cash flow statement, and note disclosures.  If the financial statement is not audited, a certification statement shall be attached and signed by a duly authorized officer of the licensee.  The certification statement shall state that the financial statement is true and accurate to the best of the officer's belief and knowledge.  If the financial statement is more than 6 months old, the applicant shall also submit an interim balance sheet and income statement not more than 3 months old.  Financial statements provided in connection with a license application under this section shall be subject to review and verification during the course of any examination or investigation conducted under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each applicant and licensee shall maintain a positive net worth at all times.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Each applicant shall post a continuous surety bond in amount of $25,000.  The surety bond shall be payable to the state of New Hampshire and the bank commissioner of the state of New Hampshire for the benefit of any person who is damaged by any violation of this chapter and shall be conditioned upon the licensee's compliance with each provision of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Surety bonds shall include a provision requiring the surety to give written notice to the commissioner 30 days in advance of the cancellation or termination of the bond.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Every bond shall provide that no recovery shall be made against the bond unless the state makes a claim for recovery or the person brings suit naming the licensee within 6 years after the act upon which the recovery or suit is based.  The obligations of the surety shall survive the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization of the licensee, including, without limitation, any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization commenced by or against the licensee under any applicable state or federal law, including the United State Bankruptcy Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) When an action is commenced on a licensee's bond, the licensee shall immediately file a new bond.  Immediately upon recovery upon any action on the bond the licensee shall file a new bond.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every applicant for licensing under this chapter shall file with the commissioner, in such form as the commissioner prescribes by rule, irrevocable consent appointing the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action, or proceeding against the applicant or the applicant's successor, executor, or administrator which arises under this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent.  A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous application need not file another.  When any person, including any nonresident of this state, engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, and such person has not filed a consent to service of process under this section and personal jurisdiction over such person cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to such person's appointment of the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner along with $5, but shall not be effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The plaintiff, who may be the attorney general in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him or her, sends a notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at such person's last address on file with the commissioner, and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this paragraph is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The commissioner may license or register individuals or firms by means of or through the facilities of a national organization which facilitates registration and licensing on a nationwide basis.
