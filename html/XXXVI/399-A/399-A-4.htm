<meta name="codesect" content="<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI. Upon the filing of the complete application for a small loan lender license for lending activities including payday loans or title loans and payment of the required application fee, if the commissioner determines that the applicant's financial resources and responsibility, experience, character and general fitness, personnel, and record of past or proposed conduct warrant the public's confidence and that the business will be operated lawfully, honestly, and fairly within the purposes of this chapter, the commissioner shall enter an order approving such application and shall issue a license to the applicant and shall issue licenses to the applicant's branches to engage in the business of a small loan lender including payday loan lender or title loan lender under and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. If a person holds a valid license under this section and is in compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, such licensee may renew the license by paying the required annual fee of $450 for the principal license and $450 for each branch office to the banking department on or before December 1st for the ensuing year that begins on January 1st.  Failure to renew the license shall result in the license terminating on December 31st.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Each license shall specify the name and address of the licensee and the location of the office or branch, and shall be conspicuously displayed there in a public area of the location.  In case such location is changed, the commissioner shall endorse the change of location on the license without charge.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. No licensee shall transact any business provided for by this chapter under a trade name or any other name different from the name stated in its license or branch office license without immediately notifying the commissioner, who shall then amend the license accordingly.  Before the corporate, organization, or trade name under which the licensed business is conducted is changed, the lender shall give notice to the commissioner who shall amend the license accordingly without cost.  The name or trade name of the licensee shall not be confusing to the public or conflict with any existing licensed lender's name.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. No license shall be issued to any person whose principal place of business is located outside of this state unless that person designates an agent residing within this state for service of process.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. Persons subject to or licensed under this chapter shall abide by applicable federal laws, and regulations promulgated thereunder, including the Federal Truth in Lending Act, and the laws, orders, and rules of this state.  Any violation of such law, rule, or order shall be a violation of this chapter.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. Persons licensed under this chapter are under a continuing obligation to update information on file with the commissioner.  If any information filed with the commissioner becomes materially inaccurate, the licensee shall promptly submit an amendment to its application records that will correct the information on file with the commissioner.  An amendment shall be considered to be filed promptly if the amendment is filed within 30 days of the event that requires the filing of the amendment.  A licensee shall submit written notification to the department of the addition or deletion of a principal, and shall provide the name and address of each new principal no later than 30 days after such change.  Each new principal shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The commissioner shall investigate management and ownership changes including, but not limited to, each principal's qualifications and business history.  The licensee shall investigate and disclose any injunction or administrative order that has been issued against the principal and whether the principal has been convicted of a misdemeanor involving the lending industry or any aspect of the lending business or convicted of any felony, prior to the commissioner's approval of such change.  Certain significant events as defined by rule shall be reported to the department in writing within 10 calendar days.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. (a) A licensee who ceases to engage in the business of a small loan lender, payday loan lender, or title loan lender at any time during a license year for any cause, including but not limited to bankruptcy, license revocation, or voluntary dissolution, shall surrender such license in person or by registered or certified mail to the commissioner within 15 calendar days of such cessation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) Withdrawal of the surrendered license becomes effective 30 days after receipt of the license by the commissioner or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless a revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the withdrawal is filed or a proceeding to revoke, suspend, or to impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within 30 days after the license is surrendered.  If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines.  If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under RSA 399-A:7 within one year after withdrawal became effective and may enter a revocation or suspension order as of the last date on which the license was effective.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Failure to comply with the provisions of this section and rules adopted under this section shall be cause for denial of future license applications and the imposition of penalties under RSA 399-A:18.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIX. Any licensee may surrender any license by delivering it to the commissioner with written notice of a surrender, but such surrender shall not affect administrative, civil, or criminal liability for acts committed prior thereto.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX. The fact that a person is licensed or registered in the state of New Hampshire under this chapter does not constitute a finding that the commissioner has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of such person or that the commissioner has recommended or given approval to any person.  It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXI. Any license fee required by this chapter shall be paid before a license may become effective.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXII. Any officer, owner, manager or agent of any licensee and any person controlling or having a contract under which he or she has a right to control such a licensee, whether exclusively or otherwise, and any person with executive authority over or in charge of any segment of such a licensee's affairs, shall reply promptly in writing, or in other designated form, to any written inquiry from the commissioner requesting a reply.  The commissioner may require that any communication made to him or her under this section be verified.">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Persons licensed under this chapter are under a continuing obligation to update information on file with the commissioner.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
