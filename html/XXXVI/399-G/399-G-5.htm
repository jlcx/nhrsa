Each principal shall provide their social security number and shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The applicant shall submit any other information that the commissioner may require including, but not limited to, the applicant's form and place of organization, the applicant's proposed method of doing business, the qualifications and business history of the applicant and those persons listed in the application, and the applicant's financial condition and history.

(a) The license issued for the licensee's principal place of business shall be referred to as a principal office license.''  Each additional authorization to conduct business issued for money transmission occurring in a location in this state that is separate from the licensee's principal place of business shall be referred to as an authorized delegate registration.''  If the applicant desires to transmit money in more than one location, the commissioner, upon favorable action on the applicant's principal office license, shall issue an authorized delegate registration'' for each location where the business of money transmission is to be conducted.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) Each license application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $500 for each principal office and $25 for each authorized delegate registration, up to a maximum annual fee of $5,000.

Surety bonds shall include a provision requiring the surety to give written notice to the commissioner 20 days in advance of the cancellation or termination of the bond.  Every bond shall provide that no recovery may be made against the bond unless the state makes a claim for recovery or the person brings suit naming the principal within 6 years after the act upon which the recovery or suit is based.  The obligations of the surety shall survive the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization of the licensee, including, without limitation, any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization commenced by or against the licensee under any applicable state or federal law, including the United States Bankruptcy Code.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) Unless the applicant is a publicly traded corporation, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the applicant's principals and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.
