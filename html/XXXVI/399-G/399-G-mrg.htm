<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No licensee shall engage in the business of money transmission under a trade or other name that is different from the name stated in its principal office license without immediately notifying the commissioner, who shall then amend the license and any registrations accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A licensee shall submit written notification to the department of the addition or deletion of a principal, and shall provide the name and address of each new principal no later than 30 days after such change.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner shall investigate management and ownership changes including, but not limited to, each principal's qualifications and business history.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Prior to the commissioner's approval of such change of a principal, the licensee shall disclose any injunction or administrative order that has been issued against the principal and whether the principal has been convicted of a misdemeanor involving financial services or a financial services-related business, or any fraud, false statements or omissions, theft or any wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury, forgery, counterfeiting, or extortion, or a conspiracy to commit any of these offenses, or convicted of any felony.

III. Licensees shall provide written notice to the department of any change in location or closing of any office no later than 30 business days following the effective date of such change of location or closing.  In the case of an emergency, as determined by the commissioner, a licensee may close a registered authorized delegate office and provide notice of the closure to the department within 2 business days.  Failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall be sufficient cause for license revocation or denial of license renewal applications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Persons licensed under this chapter are under a continuing obligation to update information on file with the commissioner.  If any information filed with the commissioner becomes materially inaccurate, the licensee shall promptly submit to the commissioner an amendment to its application that will correct the information on file with the commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 399-G:11 Record Keeping Requirements. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The licensee shall maintain such records as will enable the department to determine whether the licensee's business is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  Such records shall be maintained for a period of at least 5 years or longer if the commissioner prescribes a period by rule and made available for examination at the licensee's principal office, or its authorized delegate location, or the office of its New Hampshire registered agent.  Licensees may maintain electronic, photocopied, microfilm, or microfiche copies of original documents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A licensee may maintain its records in electronic format if, upon request, the licensee provides the commissioner with:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A full explanation of the programming of any data storage or communications systems in use;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Information from any books, records, electronic data processing systems, computers, or any other information storage system in the form requested by the commissioner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Those licensees that maintain their files in another state shall return the files to their principal New Hampshire office, to the department, or to the office of their New Hampshire registered agent for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the department.  Such licensees are required to return all files and records no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the banking department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21-day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents shall subject a licensee to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the department, shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A licensee shall keep and use business records in such form and at such location as the commissioner shall by rule determine.  The records shall enable the commissioner to determine whether the licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter, any rules adopted under it, and any other law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  The rules may contain provisions for records to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by any process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original record or document, or in any other form or manner authorized by the commissioner.  Each licensee shall preserve all such business records for as long a period as the commissioner shall prescribe by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner or examiner finds any accounts or records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records or accounting after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.

The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel employed in making examinations shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a money transmitter, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners, the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in paragraph VIII, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in paragraph VIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. All reports pursuant to this section shall be privileged and exempt from the requirements of RSA 91-A.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be exempt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The commissioner may share information with state and federal regulators, and may share information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of criminal investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The commissioner may require books and records to be translated into English and may require an interpreter to facilitate an examination at the expense of the licensee or registrant.
