At a minimum, the application shall state the primary business address of the applicant, the applicant's tax identification number, the address of its principal office and all authorized delegates located or to be located within the state, a copy of its FinCEN Form 107 Registration of Money Services Business filing, and a list of the principals of the applicant.  Each principal shall provide their social security number and shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The applicant shall submit any other information that the commissioner may require including, but not limited to, the applicant's form and place of organization, the applicant's proposed method of doing business, the qualifications and business history of the applicant and those persons listed in the application, and the applicant's financial condition and history.  The applicant shall disclose whether the applicant or any of its principals has ever been issued or been the subject of an injunction or administrative order, has ever been convicted of a misdemeanor involving the financial services industry or any aspect of the financial services business, or has ever been convicted of any felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The license issued for the licensee's principal place of business shall be referred to as a "principal office license.''  Each additional authorization to conduct business issued for money transmission occurring in a location in this state that is separate from the licensee's principal place of business shall be referred to as an "authorized delegate registration.''  If the applicant desires to transmit money in more than one location, the commissioner, upon favorable action on the applicant's principal office license, shall issue an "authorized delegate registration'' for each location where the business of money transmission is to be conducted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Each license application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $500 for each principal office and $25 for each authorized delegate registration, up to a maximum annual fee of $5,000.  Sums collected under this chapter shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the commissioner, consumer credit administration division.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The application shall include a statement of net worth in all cases and an applicant shall demonstrate and maintain a positive net worth computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A licensee shall at all times maintain a net worth of the lesser of its average daily outstanding money transmissions for the prior calendar year or $1,000,000.  Net worth statements provided in connection with a license application under this section shall be subject to review and verification during the course of any examination or investigation conducted under the authority of RSA 399-G:13.  Each money transmitter applicant shall post a continuous surety bond in the amount of $100,000.  The surety bond shall be payable to the state of New Hampshire and the bank commissioner of the state of New Hampshire for the benefit of any person who is damaged by any violation of this chapter and shall be conditioned upon the licensee's compliance with each provision of this chapter.  Surety bonds shall include a provision requiring the surety to give written notice to the commissioner 20 days in advance of the cancellation or termination of the bond.  Every bond shall provide that no recovery may be made against the bond unless the state makes a claim for recovery or the person brings suit naming the principal within 6 years after the act upon which the recovery or suit is based.  The obligations of the surety shall survive the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization of the licensee, including, without limitation, any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization commenced by or against the licensee under any applicable state or federal law, including the United States Bankruptcy Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Unless the applicant is a publicly traded corporation, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the applicant's principals and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  If the applicant is a subsidiary, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on individuals who are indirect owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The persons described in subparagraph (d) shall submit to the department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The department shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police, which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.  The department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The department may require the applicant or licensee to pay the actual costs of each background investigation and criminal history records check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The department may rely on criminal records checks reported through a national licensing facility in lieu of (e) and (f) above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every applicant for licensing under this chapter shall file with the commissioner, in such form as the commissioner prescribes by rule, irrevocable consent appointing the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action, or proceeding against the applicant or the applicant's successor, executor, or administrator which arises under this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent.  A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous application need not file another.  Any other person who engages in conduct regulated by this chapter shall be deemed to have appointed the commissioner as its agent.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner along with $5, but is not effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The plaintiff, who may be the attorney general in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him or her, forthwith sends a notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at such person's last address on file with the commissioner;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this paragraph is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon the applicant's filing of the complete application and payment of the required fee, the commissioner shall have, in accordance with RSA 541-A:29, up to 120 days to investigate and determine whether the applicant's financial resources, experience, personnel, and record of past or proposed conduct warrant the public's confidence and the issuance of a license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner may license or register individuals or firms by means of or through the facilities of a national organization which facilitates registration and licensing on a nationwide basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 399-G:12 Record Keeping. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The licensee shall maintain such records as will enable the department to determine whether the licensee's business is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  Such records shall be maintained and made available for examination at the licensee's principal office or its authorized delegate location or the office of its New Hampshire agent for a period of at least 5 years or longer if the commissioner prescribes a period by rule.  Licensees may maintain photocopies, microfilm, or microfiche copies of original documents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Those licensees that maintain their files in another state are required to return the files to their principal New Hampshire office, to the banking department, or the office of their New Hampshire agent for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the department.  Such licensees are required to return all files and records no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the banking department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21 day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents shall subject a licensee to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the department, shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A licensee shall keep and use business records in such form and at such location as the commissioner shall by rule determine.  The records shall enable the commissioner to determine whether the licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter, any rules adopted under it, and any other law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  The rules may contain provisions for records to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by any process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original record or document, or in any other form or manner authorized by the commissioner.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit any licensee to destroy original records or documents.  Each licensee shall preserve all such business records for as long a period as the commissioner shall prescribe by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner or examiner finds any accounts or records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such records or accounting after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department may examine the business affairs and records of any licensee, authorized delegate, or any other person, whether licensed or not, as it deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to it.  In determining compliance, the department may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents or matters of any licensee or person.  The department shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceedings, and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, and other documents and materials relevant to its investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter, the banking department may examine, during business hours, the records of any licensee, authorized delegate, or any other person and of any person by whom any such money transmission is made, whether such person shall be licensed to act, or claim to act, as principal, agent, or other representative, or under, or without the authority of this chapter;  and for that purpose, the banking department shall have access to the books, papers, records, files, and vaults of all such persons.  The banking department shall also have authority to examine, under oath, all persons whose testimony it may require relative to such loans or business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. Licensees shall implement a system of education, training, monitoring, and periodic inspection designed to inform their authorized delegates of their responsibilities, consistent with the Bank Secrecy Act and the requirements to file reports required by federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The affairs and records of every licensee shall be subject at any time to such periodic, special, regular, or other examination by the banking department with or without notice to the licensee.  All books, papers, files, related material, and records of assets of the licensee shall be subject to the banking department's examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any agent of the department may make a thorough examination into the business affairs of each licensee and shall report any violations of law, rule, or standard business practice to the department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The expense of examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the licensee.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel employed in making examinations shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a money transmitter, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners, the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, to review the report, recommend any changes, and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in paragraph VIII, or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in paragraph VIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. All reports pursuant to this section shall be privileged and exempt from the requirements of RSA 91-A.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be exempt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The commissioner may share information with state and federal regulators, and may share information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of criminal investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. The commissioner may require books and records to be translated into English and may require an interpreter to facilitate an examination at the expense of the licensee or registrant.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may issue an order requiring a person to whom any license has been granted or any person under the commissioner's jurisdiction to show cause why the license should not be revoked, suspended, or penalties imposed, or both, for violations of this chapter.  The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license or application pending final determination of any order to show cause, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or licensee that the order has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing.  Valid delivery of such order shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the licensee, or respondent, to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the licensee or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested, shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner, after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  The commissioner may by order, upon due notice and opportunity for hearing, assess penalties and deny, suspend, or revoke a license, registration, or application, and bar any person from licensure if it is in the public interest and the applicant, respondent, authorized delegate, or licensee, any partner, officer, member, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, respondent, authorized delegate, or licensee:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Has violated any provision of this chapter or rules thereunder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Has not met the standards established in this chapter;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Has made a false or misleading statement to the commissioner or in any reports to the commissioner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Has made fraudulent misrepresentations, has circumvented or concealed, through whatever subterfuge or device, any of the material particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to a consumer under the provisions of this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Is the subject of an order entered within the past 5 years by this state, any other state, or federal regulator denying, suspending, or revoking licenses or registration;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Is permanently, preliminarily, or temporarily enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice involving any aspect of money transmission, lending, or collection activities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Is not qualified on the basis of such factors as experience, knowledge, and financial integrity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Has engaged in dishonest or unethical practices in the conduct of the business of money transmission;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Has violated applicable federal laws or rules thereunder;

(k) Has made an unsworn falsification under RSA 641:3 to the commissioner;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) For other good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The banking department may, upon due notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend any license for a period not exceeding 30 days, pending investigation by the banking department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any license revocation, license suspension, or unfavorable action by the banking department on a license shall further comply with the provisions of RSA 541-A:30.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The banking department may take action for immediate suspension of a license, pursuant to RSA 541-A:30, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If a licensee is a partnership, association, corporation, or entity however organized, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership has so acted or failed to act in behalf of said licensee as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the commissioner finds that any licensee or applicant for license is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a money transmitter, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order revoke the license, impose penalties, or deny the application.  The commissioner may deem abandoned and withdraw any application for licensure made pursuant to this chapter, if any applicant fails to respond in writing within 180 calendar days to a written request from the commissioner requesting a response.  Such request shall be sent via certified mail to the last known address of the applicant that is on file with the commissioner.
