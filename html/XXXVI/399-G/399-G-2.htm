&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person not exempt under RSA 399-G:3 that, in its own name or on behalf of other persons, acts as a money transmitter while physically located in New Hampshire, or with, to, or from persons located in New Hampshire, shall obtain a license from the department and shall register its authorized delegates located within this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Licensure or registration in the state of New Hampshire under this chapter does not constitute a finding that the commissioner has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of such person or that the commissioner has recommended or given approval to any such person.  It is unlawful for any licensee or registrant to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any license fee required by this chapter shall be paid before a license becomes effective.  Authorized delegate registrations shall be effective upon the commissioner's receipt of written notice conditioned upon payment of the registration fee within 30 calendar days, as required by RSA 399-G:4.
