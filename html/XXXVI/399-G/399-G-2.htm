II. Any money transmitted under the provisions of this chapter shall be further governed by any other applicable laws of the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, nothing within this chapter shall restrict the right of the attorney general to enforce the provisions of RSA 358-A:2, XIII, regarding the issuance and terms of stored value cards which are gift certificates as defined by RSA 358-A:1, IV-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.
