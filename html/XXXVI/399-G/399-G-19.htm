I. Money transmitters shall be liable to customers for the amount of the money or monetary value as well as any fees paid by the customer and received by the money transmitter, authorized delegate, or person acting on his or her behalf, if the monetary value fails to reach its intended recipient unless transmission to the recipient is prohibited by law.

If an intended recipient of a money transmission fails to accept or retrieve the monetary value transmitted, unless otherwise instructed by his or her customer, a licensee's responsibility to any person for a money transmission conducted on that person's behalf by the licensee's authorized delegate shall be limited to the amount of the monetary value transmitted.
