The commissioner may issue an order requiring a person to whom any license has been granted or any person under the commissioner's jurisdiction to show cause why the license should not be revoked, suspended, or penalties imposed, or both, for violations of this chapter.  The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license or application pending final determination of any order to show cause, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or licensee that the order has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing.  Valid delivery of such order shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the licensee, or respondent, to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the licensee or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested, shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner, after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  The commissioner may by order, upon due notice and opportunity for hearing, assess penalties and deny, suspend, or revoke a license, registration, or application, and bar any person from licensure if it is in the public interest and the applicant, respondent, authorized delegate, or licensee, any partner, officer, member, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, respondent, authorized delegate, or licensee:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Has violated any provision of this chapter or rules thereunder;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) Has not met the standards established in this chapter;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(c) Has filed an application for licensing which as of its effective date, or as of any date after filing in the case of an order denying effectiveness, was incomplete in any material respect or contained any statement which was, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(d) Has made a false or misleading statement to the commissioner or in any reports to the commissioner;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) Has made fraudulent misrepresentations, has circumvented or concealed, through whatever subterfuge or device, any of the material particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to a consumer under the provisions of this chapter;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(f) Is the subject of an order entered within the past 5 years by this state, any other state, or federal regulator denying, suspending, or revoking licenses or registration;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(g) Is permanently, preliminarily, or temporarily enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice involving any aspect of money transmission, lending, or collection activities;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(h) Is not qualified on the basis of such factors as experience, knowledge, and financial integrity;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(i) Has engaged in dishonest or unethical practices in the conduct of the business of money transmission;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(j) Has violated applicable federal laws or rules thereunder;<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(k) Has made an unsworn falsification under RSA 641:3 to the commissioner;  or<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(l) For other good cause shown.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII.
