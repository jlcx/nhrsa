The attorney general shall order a rejection of the registration until such time as the hearing, once requested, has taken place and the attorney general has entered his findings thereon, or such petition is withdrawn;  provided, however, that if by the time that said findings are entered, all of the particulars specified in the attorney general's notice have been corrected or, as a result of the attorney general's reconsideration and hearing, have been met to the attorney general's satisfaction, the attorney general shall order registration of the subdivided lands.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The fact that a statement of record with respect to a subdivision has been filed or is in effect shall not be deemed a finding by the attorney general that the statement of record is true and accurate on its face, or be held to mean the attorney general has in any way passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, such subdivision.  It shall be unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser any representation contrary to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The subdivider shall not make any material change in the plan of disposition or development of the subdivided lands contained in the application for registration without notifying the attorney general, obtaining his prior approval and making appropriate amendment of the public offering statement.

II. If it appears that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any false, deceptive or misleading advertising to offer or dispose of any lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands, the attorney general may require by written notice the filing of advertising material relating to such subdivided lands prior to its distribution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If it appears that a person has engaged or is about to engage in an act or practice constituting a violation of a provision of this chapter or a rule or order hereunder, the attorney general, with or without prior administrative proceedings, may bring an action in the superior court to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order hereunder.  Upon proper showing, injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders shall be granted, and a receiver may be appointed pursuant to paragraph III-a.  The attorney general is not required to post a bond in any court proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. In connection with any action brought under paragraph III, the attorney general may also petition the court to appoint a receiver to take charge of the business of any person during the course of litigation when the attorney general has reason to believe that such an appointment is necessary to prevent such person from continuing to engage in any act or practice declared unlawful by this chapter and to preserve the assets of said person to restore to any other person any money or property, acquired by any unlawful act or practice.  The receiver shall have the authority to sue for, collect, receive and take into his possession all the goods and chattels, rights and credits, moneys and effects, lands and tenements, books, records, documents, papers, choses in action, bills, notes and property of every description, including property with which such property has been mingled if it cannot be identified in kind because of such commingling, derived by means of any unlawful act or practice, and to sell, convey and assign the same and hold, dispose and distribute the proceeds thereof under the direction of the court.  Any person who has suffered damages as a result of the use of any unlawful act or practice and submits proof to the satisfaction of the court that he has in fact been damaged may participate with general creditors in the distribution of the assets to the extent that he has sustained out-of-pocket losses.  In the case of a partnership or business entity, the receiver shall settle the estate and distribute the assets under the direction of the court.  The court shall have jurisdiction of all questions arising in such proceedings and may make such orders and judgments therein as may be required.  In lieu of the foregoing procedure, the court may permit any person alleged to have violated this chapter to post a bond in a manner and in an amount to be fixed by the court.  Said bond shall be made payable to the state and may be distributed by the court only after a decision on the merits and the process of appeals has been exhausted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The attorney general may intervene in any suit involving subdivided lands alleging violation of this chapter.  In any such suit by or against a subdivider involving subdivided lands, the subdivider promptly shall furnish the attorney general notice of the suit and copies of all pleadings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The attorney general may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Accept registrations filed in other states, in lieu of the filing required by this chapter upon the filing of a fee of $100;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Contract with similar agencies in this state or other jurisdictions to perform investigative functions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Accept grants in aid from any source.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Prior to issuing the temporary cease and desist order, the attorney general shall attempt to give telephonic or other notice of the proposal to issue a temporary cease and desist order to the person.  Every temporary cease and desist order shall include findings of fact in support of the attorney general's determination that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing the order and a provision that upon request a hearing will be held within 10 business days of the deposit in the United States mails or delivery in hand of said order to determine whether or not it becomes permanent.

(a) Failed to comply with the terms of a cease and desist order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

I. Any person aggrieved by a decision or action of the attorney general may, by petition, appeal from said decision or action to the superior court for review.  The superior court may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision or action of the attorney general as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The filing of the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the attorney general's decision.  The attorney general may grant, or the superior court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 30 days after the service of the petition, or within further time allowed by the court, the attorney general shall transmit to the superior court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review.  By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record may be shortened.  A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs.  The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If, before the date set for a court hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the attorney general, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the attorney general upon conditions determined by the court.  The attorney general may modify his findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the superior court.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-A:16 Civil Remedy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any subdivider who disposes of any lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands in violation of this chapter, or who in disposing of any lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands makes an untrue statement of a material fact, or who in disposing of any lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands omits a material fact required to be stated in a registration statement or public offering statement or necessary to make the statements made not misleading, is liable to the purchaser of such lot, parcel, unit or interest, as set forth in paragraph II, unless, in the case of an untruth or omission, it is proved that the purchaser knew of the untruth or omission or that the subdivider did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the untruth or omission, or that the purchaser did not rely on the untruth or omission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any purchaser, who is eligible for relief under paragraph I, may bring an action to restrain by temporary or permanent injunction any act or practice declared unlawful by this chapter and may recover the consideration, including all finance charges, paid in connection with the purchase of the lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per year from the date of all such payments, less the amount of any income received from such subdivided lands, upon tender of deed reconveying title to the subdivider which is as good and marketable as that which was conveyed to the purchaser by the subdivider.  In the discretion of the court, exemplary damages of up to $5,000 may also be awarded.  If the purchaser no longer owns the lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands, he may recover the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender of a reconveyance less the value of the lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands when disposed of and less interest at the rate of 6 percent per year on that amount from the date of disposition.  If the purchaser prevails in any such action, he may be awarded all reasonable court costs and attorney's fees, as approved by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who materially participates in any disposition of a lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands in the manner specified in paragraph I and knew of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist is also liable jointly and severally with the subdivider if and to the extent such liability may exist at common law or under other statutory provision.  A right to contribution exists among persons so liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every person whose occupation gives authority to a statement which with his consent has been used in an application for registration or public offering statement, if he is not otherwise associated with the subdivision and development plan in a material way, is liable only for false statements knowingly made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. At any time before the entry of an action under this section, and thereafter only with the approval of the court, a subdivider or any other person may limit his exposure herein by tendering a written offer to reimburse the injured person for all mandatory damages set forth in paragraph II, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, if any, to the date of such tender upon reconveyance of title as set forth in paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A person may not recover under this section in actions commenced more than 2 years from the date the purchaser knew or should have known of the existence of his cause of action, but in any case not more than 6 years after his first payment of money to the subdivider in the contested transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring subdivided lands to waive compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under it is void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The owner, publisher, licensee or operator of any newspaper, magazine, visual or sound radio broadcasting station or network of stations or the agents or employees of any such owner, publisher, licensee or operator of such newspaper, magazine, station or network of stations shall not be liable under this chapter for any advertising of any subdivision, lot, parcel or unit in any subdivision carried in any such newspaper or magazine or by any such visual or sound radio broadcasting station or network of stations nor shall any of them be liable under this chapter for the contents of any such advertisement.
<br>

IX. Any broker or real estate salesman violating any provision of this chapter may, in addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter, have his real estate broker's or salesman's license suspended or revoked by the real estate commission pursuant to RSA 331-A for such time as in the circumstances it considers justified.
