&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For subdivisions not entitled to exemption under RSA 356-A:3, I-a, a subdivider of subdivided lands of no more than 50 lots, parcels, units or interests may make an abbreviated registration in lieu of these requirements, which shall contain only the documents and information required by RSA 356-A:5, I(a), (c)-(h), (j), (n)-(p) and (v);  provided, however, that this section shall not apply to subdivided lands involving time share interests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A subdivider of a subdivision which has been registered under the federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act may file, in lieu of the documents and information required by RSA 356-A:5, I(b)-(e), and (i)-(u) and RSA 356-A:6, I, a copy of an effective statement of record, a property report, and any exhibits requested by the attorney general, filed with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

V. If the subdivider registers additional subdivided lands to be offered for disposition, he may consolidate the subsequent registration with any earlier registration offering subdivided lands for disposition under the same promotional plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. At any time the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that the subdivider may be unable to complete the development of the subdivided lands, or provide for its maintenance, if responsibility therefor is assumed by the subdivider, as represented in its application for registration due to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Its failure to commence or complete the development of the subdivided lands according to schedules set forth in the application;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Its failure to commence or complete the development of any other subdivided lands or condominium according to representations authorized and made by the subdivider or declarant in connection with the offering or disposing of any interest therein;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Its failure to set forth a reasonable plan to obtain adequate financing to commence or complete the development of the subdivided lands or provide for its maintenance;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Its commission of any false, deceptive or misleading acts in connection with the offering or disposing of any interest in any subdivided lands or condominium;
<br>
it may require the subdivider to post a bond, in favor of the state, or to provide evidence of financial security in such amount as the attorney general determines to be necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the commencement and completion of the development of the subdivision.  Such bond shall not be accepted unless it is with a surety company authorized to do business in this state.  Any person aggrieved by the failure of the subdivider to complete or maintain the subdivided lands may proceed on such bond against the subdivider or surety or both to recover damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Every application shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount equal to $30 per lot, parcel, unit or interest, except that the initial application fee shall not be less than $300 nor more than $2,000, and the fee for any application for registration of additional lots, parcels, units or interests shall not be less than $200 nor more than $2,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The applicant of a subdivision to be converted within the meaning of RSA 356-C:1, II, shall, in addition to the requirements contained in this section, include with the application for registration a copy of the notices described in RSA 356-C:3, I or II and a certified statement that such notices comply with the provisions of RSA 356-C:3, I or II and have been or will be mailed to each of the tenants in the subdivisions for which registration is sought, in compliance with RSA 356-C:3, I or II.
