(a) Failed to comply with the terms of a cease and desist order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Been convicted after final appeal in any court subsequent to the filing of the application for registration for a crime involving fraud, deception, false pretenses, misrepresentation, false advertising, or dishonest dealing in real estate transactions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Disposed of, concealed, or diverted any funds or assets of any person so as to defeat the rights of subdivision purchasers;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Failed to perform any stipulation or agreement made with the agency as an inducement to grant any registration, to reinstate any registration, or to approve any promotional plan or public offering statement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Made intentional misrepresentations or concealed material facts in an application for registration.
<br>
Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the attorney general finds after notice and hearing that the subdivider has been guilty of a violation for which revocation could be ordered, he may issue a cease and desist order instead.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the attorney general makes a determination that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order, he may, without hearing, issue a temporary cease and desist order subject to the requirements of RSA 356-A:12, II.
