I. If the attorney general determines after notice and hearing that a person has:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Violated any provisions of this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Directly or through an agent or employee knowingly engaged in any false, deceptive, or misleading advertising, promotional, or sales methods to offer or dispose of any interest in subdivided lands;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Made any material change in the plan of disposition and development of the subdivided lands subsequent to the order of registration without notifying the attorney general, obtaining his prior approval and making an appropriate amendment to the public offering statement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Disposed of any subdivided lands which have not been registered with the attorney general;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Violated any lawful order or rule of the attorney general;
<br>
he may issue an order requiring the person to cease and desist from the unlawful practice and to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the attorney general will carry out the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the attorney general determines that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order, he may, without hearing, issue a temporary cease and desist order.  Prior to issuing the temporary cease and desist order, the attorney general shall attempt to give telephonic or other notice of the proposal to issue a temporary cease and desist order to the person.  Every temporary cease and desist order shall include findings of fact in support of the attorney general's determination that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing the order and a provision that upon request a hearing will be held within 10 business days of the deposit in the United States mails or delivery in hand of said order to determine whether or not it becomes permanent.
