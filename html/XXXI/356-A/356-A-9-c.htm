&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-A:9-c Taxation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each lot, parcel, or unit in which time sharing interests, as defined in RSA 356-A:1, XVI, have been created shall be valued for purposes of real property taxation as if such lot, parcel, or unit were owned by a single taxpayer.  Condominium units in which time sharing interests have been created shall be taxed as wholly owned condominium units.  The total cumulative purchase price paid for time sharing interests in any such lot, parcel, or unit shall not be determinative of its assessed value.  No taxes shall be assessed against the individual owner of a time sharing interest but shall be assessed against the record owner of such lot, parcel, or unit;  the owners' association;  trustee;  or managing agent, as appropriate.
