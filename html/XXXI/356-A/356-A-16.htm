Any subdivider who disposes of any lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands in violation of this chapter, or who in disposing of any lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands makes an untrue statement of a material fact, or who in disposing of any lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands omits a material fact required to be stated in a registration statement or public offering statement or necessary to make the statements made not misleading, is liable to the purchaser of such lot, parcel, unit or interest, as set forth in paragraph II, unless, in the case of an untruth or omission, it is proved that the purchaser knew of the untruth or omission or that the subdivider did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the untruth or omission, or that the purchaser did not rely on the untruth or omission.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Any purchaser, who is eligible for relief under paragraph I, may bring an action to restrain by temporary or permanent injunction any act or practice declared unlawful by this chapter and may recover the consideration, including all finance charges, paid in connection with the purchase of the lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per year from the date of all such payments, less the amount of any income received from such subdivided lands, upon tender of deed reconveying title to the subdivider which is as good and marketable as that which was conveyed to the purchaser by the subdivider.  In the discretion of the court, exemplary damages of up to $5,000 may also be awarded.  If the purchaser no longer owns the lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands, he may recover the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender of a reconveyance less the value of the lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands when disposed of and less interest at the rate of 6 percent per year on that amount from the date of disposition.  If the purchaser prevails in any such action, he may be awarded all reasonable court costs and attorney's fees, as approved by the court.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Any person who materially participates in any disposition of a lot, parcel, unit or interest in subdivided lands in the manner specified in paragraph I and knew of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist is also liable jointly and severally with the subdivider if and to the extent such liability may exist at common law or under other statutory provision.  A right to contribution exists among persons so liable.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV.

At any time before the entry of an action under this section, and thereafter only with the approval of the court, a subdivider or any other person may limit his exposure herein by tendering a written offer to reimburse the injured person for all mandatory damages set forth in paragraph II, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, if any, to the date of such tender upon reconveyance of title as set forth in paragraph II.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI.
