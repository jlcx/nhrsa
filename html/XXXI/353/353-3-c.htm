I. All hotel keepers and all persons keeping public lodging houses or cabins may remove or cause to be removed from such establishment any guest remaining in a rental unit in violation of RSA 353:3-b or RSA 353:3-bb by notifying such guest that the establishment no longer desires to entertain him or her and requesting that the guest immediately leave.  Any guest who remains or attempts to remain in a rental unit after being so requested to leave shall be guilty of a violation.  For the purpose of this section, the term "rental unit'' shall include residential property rented for one month or less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All hotel keepers and persons keeping public lodging houses, cabins, or any rental unit may immediately remove or cause to be immediately removed by any law enforcement officer of this state, any guest who willfully denies other guests their right to quiet enjoyment of their tenancies, including but not limited to any guest who:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Disturbs, threatens, or endangers other guests;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Is less than 21 years of age and possesses alcohol;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Violates any rule of the hotel, lodging house, or campground that is posted in a conspicuous place and manner at the guest registration desk and in each guest room;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Violates any local or state law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. The right to remove, or cause to be removed, shall arise after the hotel keeper or person keeping a public lodging house, or cabin, or their agents makes a reasonable attempt to verbally warn said guest to cease and desist said breach of quiet enjoyment or violation of local or state law.  Upon such immediate eviction, the guest shall be refunded the unused portion of his or her pre-paid rental fee less damage charges for his or her actions.  For the purpose of this section, the term "rental unit'' shall include residential property rented for one month or less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any law enforcement officer of this state, upon request of a hotel keeper, or person keeping a public lodging house, or cabin, shall place under arrest and take into custody any guest who violates this section in the presence of the officer.  Upon arrest, the guest shall be deemed to have abandoned his right of occupancy of the rental unit and the operator of the establishment may then make such unit available to other guests.  The operator of said establishment shall employ all reasonable means to protect any personal property left on the premises by such guest.
