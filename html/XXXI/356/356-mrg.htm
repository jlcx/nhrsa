The attorney general may administer an oath or affirmation to any person and conduct hearings in aid of any investigation under this chapter.

Notice of hearing and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the person, who may appear in opposition to the petition.  If the court finds reasonable cause to believe that there may have been a violation of any provision of this chapter and that the testimony, documents or objects subpoenaed are relevant to the investigation, it shall order the person to appear for testimony or to produce the document or object for inspection and copying as demanded, subject to any modification of the subpoena the court prescribes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any procedure, testimony taken or document or object produced under this chapter shall be kept confidential by the attorney general before the institution against the person of an action brought under this chapter for the violation under investigation unless confidentiality is waived by the person or disclosure is authorized by the superior court.
