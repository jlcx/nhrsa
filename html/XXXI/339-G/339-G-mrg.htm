&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-G:3 Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Bottle-type water dispensers designed for dispensing both hot and cold water shall not have standby energy consumption greater than 1.2 kilowatt hours per day, as measured in accordance with the test criteria contained in Version 1.1 of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's "ENERGY STAR Program Requirements for Bottled Water Coolers,'' except that units with an integral, automatic timer shall not be tested using Section D, "Timer Usage,'' of the test criteria.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Commercial hot food holding cabinets shall have a maximum idle energy rate of 40 watts per cubic foot of interior volume, as determined by the "idle energy rate-dry test'' in ASTM F2140-01, "Standard Test Method for Performance of Hot Food Holding Cabinets'' published by ASTM International.  Interior volume shall be measured in accordance with the method shown in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's "ENERGY STAR Program Requirements for Commercial Hot Food Holding Cabinets'' as in effect on August 15, 2003.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Residential furnaces shall comply with the following Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE), and electricity ratio:
<PRE>
 Product Type Minimum Maximum electricity 
 AFUE Ratio 
 
Natural gas- and propane- 90 percent 2.0 percent 
fired furnaces 
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commission may adopt rules to exempt compliance with the residential furnace AFUE standards at any building, site or location where complying with the standards would be in conflict with any local zoning ordinance, building or plumbing code, or other rule regarding installation and venting of residential furnaces.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-G:4 Sale and Installation of Products. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After December 31, 2008, no new bottle-type water dispenser or commercial hot food holding cabinet shall be sold or offered for sale in the state unless the efficiency of the new product meets or exceeds the efficiency standards in RSA 339-G:3.  After December 31, 2009 no new bottle-type water dispenser or commercial hot food holding cabinet shall be installed in the state unless the energy efficiency of the new product meets or exceeds the efficiency standards in RSA 339-G:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 6 months after the effective date of this section, the commission, in consultation with the attorney general, shall determine if implementation of state standards for residential furnaces requires a waiver from federal preemption.  The commission shall make separate determinations for each part of the state standards including minimum Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE), maximum electricity ratio, and any prescriptive requirements.  If the commission determines that a waiver from federal preemption is not needed for any part, then after December 31, 2008, or the date which is one year after the date of said determination, if later, no new residential furnace may be sold or offered for sale in the state unless the efficiency of the new product meets or exceeds the applicable non-preempted part of the efficiency standards in RSA 339-G:3.  If the commission determines that a waiver from federal preemption is required for all or part of the state standards, then the commission shall apply for such waiver within one year of such determination and upon approval of such waiver application, the applicable state standards shall go into effect at the earliest date permitted by federal law.  The commission shall certify any determinations and approvals under this paragraph to the secretary of state and the director of the office of legislative services.
