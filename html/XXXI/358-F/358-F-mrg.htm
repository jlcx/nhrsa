Before selling to any customer any used motor vehicle which is unsafe for operation upon the highways pursuant to RSA 266:8, the dealer shall, upon the request of the customer, conduct or have conducted a safety inspection of such vehicle.  If the vehicle is found to be unsafe for operation, the dealer may sell the vehicle to the customer without correcting the defects, but only if the dealer presents to the customer at the time of sale a notice which states:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This motor vehicle will not pass a New Hampshire inspection and is unsafe for operation.  The following defects must be corrected before an inspection sticker will be issued.
<br>
The dealer shall list all inspection defects under this statement and specify the date on which the inspection was conducted and the person who performed the inspection.  The dealer may make a reasonable charge for conducting the inspection.
