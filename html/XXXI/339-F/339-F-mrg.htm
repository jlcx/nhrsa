<center><h3>Section 339-F:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-F:3 Test Method. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials ("ASTM'') standard E2187-04, "Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes.''  The commissioner may adopt a subsequent ASTM Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes upon a finding that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with ASTM Standard E2187-04 and the performance standard in RSA 339-F:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Testing shall be conducted on 10 layers of filter paper.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Forty replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The performance standard required by RSA 339-F:4 shall only be applied to a complete test trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability of the testing results.  The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.19 pursuant to RSA 339-F:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. This section does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistent with this chapter for any other purpose.

<center><h3>Section 339-F:4</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-F:4 Performance Standard. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When tested in accordance with RSA 339-F:3, no more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial shall exhibit full length burns.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each cigarette listed in a certification submitted pursuant to RSA 339-F:6 that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard set forth in paragraph I shall have at least 2 nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column.  At least one complete band shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette.  For cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design, there shall be at least 2 bands fully located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column, or 10 millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column for non-filtered cigarettes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The manufacturer of a cigarette that the commissioner determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in RSA 339-F:3 shall propose a test method and performance standard for such cigarette to the commissioner.  Upon approval of the proposed test method and a determination by the commissioner that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in paragraph I, the manufacturer may employ such test method and performance standard to certify such cigarette pursuant to RSA 339-F:6.  If another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards, or similar requirements, that include a test method and performance standard for cigarettes, and if officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved a manufacturer's proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette under a legal provision comparable to this paragraph, that manufacturer may employ that alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette in this state, provided that the manufacturer obtains the approval of the commissioner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  All other applicable requirements of this chapter shall apply to such manufacturer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This chapter shall be implemented in accordance with the substance of the New York Fire Safety Standards for Cigarettes, as amended.
