&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-F:3 Test Method. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials ("ASTM'') standard E2187-04, "Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes.''  The commissioner may adopt a subsequent ASTM Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes upon a finding that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with ASTM Standard E2187-04 and the performance standard in RSA 339-F:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Testing shall be conducted on 10 layers of filter paper.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Forty replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The performance standard required by RSA 339-F:4 shall only be applied to a complete test trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability of the testing results.  The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.19 pursuant to RSA 339-F:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. This section does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistent with this chapter for any other purpose.
