&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-F:4 Performance Standard. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When tested in accordance with RSA 339-F:3, no more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial shall exhibit full length burns.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each cigarette listed in a certification submitted pursuant to RSA 339-F:6 that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard set forth in paragraph I shall have at least 2 nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column.  At least one complete band shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette.  For cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design, there shall be at least 2 bands fully located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column, or 10 millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column for non-filtered cigarettes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The manufacturer of a cigarette that the commissioner determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in RSA 339-F:3 shall propose a test method and performance standard for such cigarette to the commissioner.  Upon approval of the proposed test method and a determination by the commissioner that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in paragraph I, the manufacturer may employ such test method and performance standard to certify such cigarette pursuant to RSA 339-F:6.  If another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards, or similar requirements, that include a test method and performance standard for cigarettes, and if officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved a manufacturer's proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette under a legal provision comparable to this paragraph, that manufacturer may employ that alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette in this state, provided that the manufacturer obtains the approval of the commissioner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  All other applicable requirements of this chapter shall apply to such manufacturer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This chapter shall be implemented in accordance with the substance of the New York Fire Safety Standards for Cigarettes, as amended.
