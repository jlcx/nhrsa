&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 359-B:2 Findings and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court makes the following findings:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting.  Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It is the purpose of this chapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 359-B:11 Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in the consumer's file is disputed by a consumer, and such dispute is directly conveyed to the consumer reporting agency by the consumer, the consumer reporting agency shall within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 30 days, beginning on the date the appropriate consumer assistance office receives notice of the dispute from the consumer, reinvestigate and record the current status of that information unless it has reasonable grounds to believe that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Within 10 business days after completion of a reinvestigation, the agency shall provide the consumer with written information, free of charge, which includes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A statement that the reinvestigation is completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A consumer report that is based on the consumer's file as that file is revised as a result of the reinvestigation.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A description or indication of any changes made in the consumer report as a result of those revisions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

III. If after such reinvestigation such information is found to be inaccurate or can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall within 10 business days change or delete such information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute, the consumer may file a brief statement setting forth the nature of the dispute.  The consumer reporting agency may limit such statements to not more than 100 words if it provides the consumer with assistance in writing in clear summary of the dispute.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Whenever a statement of a dispute is filed, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that it is frivolous or irrelevant, the consumer reporting agency shall, in any subsequent consumer report containing the information in question, clearly note that it is disputed by the consumer and provide either the consumer's statement or a clear and accurate codification or summary of the consumer's statement.

VIII. In conducting a reinvestigation, the consumer reporting agency shall review and consider all relevant information submitted by the consumer with respect to the disputed item of information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any time a consumer reporting agency is required to make a written disclosure to consumers pursuant to 15 U.S.C. section 1681g, it shall disclose, in at least 12-point type, and in bold type as indicated, the following notice:

<p>
<b>NOTICE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE CONSUMERS</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
Right to Security Freeze on Consumer Credit Report
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You have the right to place a "security freeze''  on your credit report pursuant to RSA 359-B:24.  Under New Hampshire law, what is commonly known as a credit report is referred to as a "consumer report.''  A security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your consumer report without your express authorization.  The security freeze must be requested in writing, by certified mail.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You may obtain a security freeze on your consumer report at no charge if you are a victim of identity theft and you submit a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint that you filed with a law enforcement agency about unlawful use of your personal information by another person.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The consumer reporting agency may charge you a fee for the security freeze if you are not a victim of identity theft.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent.  However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gains access to the personal and financial information in your consumer report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding new loans, credit, mortgage, insurance, government services or payments, rental housing, employment, investment, license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, internet credit card transaction, or other services, including an extension of credit at point of sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
When you place a security freeze on your consumer report, within 10 business days you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your consumer report or authorize the release of your consumer report for a specific party or period of time after the freeze is in place.  To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Proper identification to verify your identity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The proper information regarding the third party who will receive the credit report or the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Payment of the applicable fee, if any.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a freeze on a consumer report must comply with the request no later than 3 business days after receiving the request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity with which you have an existing account that requests information in your consumer report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the accounts, provided the use of your credit report is for a permissible purpose as provided by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You have the right to bring a civil action against anyone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A consumer may place a security freeze on his or her consumer report as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A consumer who has been the victim of identity theft may place a security freeze on his or her consumer report by making a request in writing, by certified mail to a consumer reporting agency with a valid copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint the consumer has filed with a law enforcement agency about unlawful use of personal information by another person.  In the case of a victim of identity theft, a consumer reporting agency shall not charge a fee for placing, removing, or temporarily lifting for a specific party or period of time a security freeze on a consumer report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A consumer who has not been the victim of identity theft may place a security freeze on his or her consumer report by making a request in writing, by certified mail to a consumer reporting agency.  A consumer reporting agency may charge a fee of no more than $10 to a consumer for each freeze, removal of a freeze, or temporary lift of a freeze for a period of time or specific party or for reissuing the same or a new personal identification number if the consumer fails to retain the original personal identification number provided by the agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Subject to the exceptions in paragraph XIII, when a security freeze has been placed on a consumer report, the consumer reporting agency shall not release the consumer report or any information from it without the express authorization of the consumer.  This subparagraph shall not prevent a consumer reporting agency from advising a third party that a security freeze is in effect with respect to the consumer report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A consumer reporting agency shall place a security freeze on a consumer report no later than 5 business days after receiving a written request from the consumer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The consumer reporting agency shall send a written confirmation of the security freeze to the consumer within 10 business days after placing the security freeze and shall provide the consumer with a personal identification number or password, other than the consumer's social security number, to be used by the consumer when providing authorization for the release of a consumer report to a specific party or for a period of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the consumer wishes to allow access to the consumer report by a specific party or for a certain period of time while a freeze is in place, the consumer may contact the consumer reporting agency, request that the freeze be temporarily lifted, and provide each of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Proper identification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency pursuant to paragraph IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The proper information regarding the specific party granted access or the time period for which the report is to be available to users.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Payment of the applicable fee, if any, pursuant to subparagraph I(b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A consumer reporting agency may develop procedures involving use of phone, fax, internet, or other electronic media to receive and process requests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a consumer report pursuant to paragraph V shall comply with the request no later than 3 business days after receiving the request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A consumer reporting agency shall remove or temporarily lift a freeze placed on a consumer report only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon consumer request, pursuant to paragraph V or XI;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the consumer report was frozen due to a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer.  If a consumer reporting agency intends to remove a freeze upon a consumer report pursuant to this subparagraph, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer in writing prior to removing the freeze on the consumer report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If a third party requests access to a consumer report on which a security freeze is in effect and this request is in connection with an application for credit or any other use and the consumer does not allow access to the consumer report for that specific party or period of time, the third party may treat the application as incomplete.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. If a consumer requests a security freeze pursuant to this section, the consumer reporting agency shall disclose to the consumer the processes of placing and temporarily lifting a security freeze and the process for allowing access to information from the consumer report for a specific party or period of time while the security freeze is in place.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. A security freeze shall remain in place until the consumer requests that the security freeze be removed.  A consumer reporting agency shall remove a security freeze within 3 business days of receiving a request for removal from a consumer who provides:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Proper identification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency pursuant to paragraph IV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 359-B:29 Police Report Regarding Identity Theft. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A person who has learned or reasonably suspects that he or she has been the victim of identify theft may contact the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over his or her place of residence, which shall take a police report of the matter, and provide the complainant with a copy of that report.  Notwithstanding the fact that jurisdiction may lie elsewhere for investigation and prosecution of a crime of identity fraud, the local law enforcement agency shall take the complaint and provide the complainant with a copy of the complaint and may refer the complaint to a law enforcement agency in a different jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall interfere with the discretion of a local law enforcement agency to allocate resources for investigations of crimes.  A complaint filed under this section is not required to be counted as an open case for purposes such as compiling open case statistics.
