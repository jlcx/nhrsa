<codesect>
A consumer reporting agency shall make all disclosures pursuant to RSA 359-B:9 and furnish all consumer reports pursuant to RSA 359-B:11, VII, without charge to the consumer if, within 30 days after receipt by such consumer of a notification pursuant to RSA 359-B:15 or notification from a debt collection agency affiliated with such consumer reporting agency stating that the consumer's credit rating may be or has been adversely affected, the consumer makes a request under RSA 359-B:9 or 359-B:11, VII.  Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge on the consumer for making disclosure to such consumer pursuant to RSA 359-B:9, the charge for which shall be indicated to the consumer prior to making disclosure;  and for furnishing notifications, statements, summaries, or codifications to a person designated by the consumer pursuant to RSA 359-B:11, VII, the charge for which shall be indicated to the consumer prior to furnishing such information and shall not exceed the charge that the consumer reporting agency would impose on each designated recipient for a consumer report, except that no charge may be made for notifying such persons of the deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or which can no longer be verified.
