&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 359-B:7 Compliance Procedures. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of RSA 359-B:5 and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under RSA 359-B:4.  These procedures shall require that prospective users of the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose.  Every consumer reporting agency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the identity of a new prospective user and the uses certified by such prospective user prior to furnishing such user a consumer report.  No consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to any person if it has reasonable grounds for believing that the consumer report will not be used for a purpose listed in RSA 359-B:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report, it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.
