&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 359-O:1 Purpose.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court has determined that certain businesses and/or individuals within the state are possessing and selling certain synthetic drugs which are described in this chapter, and are potentially dangerous to users and society, and for which the long-term effects are not yet known.  The effects of these substances are a health concern to the citizens of the state.  Not all of the substances are categorized as illegal controlled substances under state or federal law.  By selling these substances for smoking and ingestion under the guise of incense, the manufacturers avoid the United States Food and Drug Administration process for study and approval of such substances prior to distribution for consumption.  In addition, by marketing these so-called incense products directed at the controlled drug subculture, the manufacturers and sellers avoid the Schedule I implications of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the state controlled drug act.  The state has determined that there is no legitimate purpose for the sale, possession, or use of these substances.
