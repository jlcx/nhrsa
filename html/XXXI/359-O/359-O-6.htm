&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 359-O:6 Control of Synthetic Drugs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner of the department of health and human services may add, delete, or otherwise revise the control of synthetic drugs as defined under RSA 359-O:2, by rule, pursuant to RSA 541-A, after hearing and after consulting with the pharmacy board.  In making a determination regarding a synthetic drug, the commissioner shall consider the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Actual or relative potential for abuse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) State of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) History and current pattern of abuse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Scope, duration, and significance of abuse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Risk to the public health;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Potential of the substance to produce psychic or physical dependence liability;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After considering the factors in paragraph I, the commissioner shall make findings relative to the substance and adopt a rule controlling the substance if he or she finds the substance has a potential for abuse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In addition to the provisions of RSA 541-A, the commissioner shall give due notice of the time, place, and purpose of all hearings required under this chapter to podiatrists, osteopaths, hospitals, pharmacists, physicians, dentists, veterinarians, advanced practice registered nurses, optometrists, laboratories, registered manufacturers, and suppliers and to the general public by such means as he or she shall deem adequate.  From and after the hearing date, the sale or dispensation (except by prescription) of a drug or chemical containing any quantity of such substance as is the subject matter of the hearing shall be suspended pending a determination as to whether such substance is to be designated as a controlled drug.  Designation as a controlled drug shall result in the continued suspension of the sale or dispensation (except by prescription) of any drug or chemical containing any quantity of such synthetic drug until the effective date of the designation.  The substance shall thereafter be included in the definition of synthetic drug pursuant to this chapter.  If any substance is so designated, the commissioner shall publish the designation in a newspaper of general circulation in the state once each week for 3 successive weeks or on the department's public Internet website.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Substances which are precursors of the controlled precursor shall not be subject to control solely because they are precursors of the controlled precursor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If any substance is designated, rescheduled, or deleted as a controlled substance under federal law and notice thereof is given to the commissioner, the commissioner shall similarly control the substance under this chapter after the expiration of 30 days from publication in the Federal Register of a final order designating a substance as a controlled substance or rescheduling or deleting a synthetic drug, unless, within that 30-day period, the commissioner objects to inclusion, rescheduling, or deletion.  In that case, the commissioner shall publish the reasons for objection and afford all interested persons an opportunity to be heard.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the commissioner shall publish a decision, which shall be final unless altered by law.  Upon publication of objection to inclusion, rescheduling, or deletion under this chapter by the commissioner, control under this chapter shall be stayed until the commissioner publishes a decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Substances shall be listed by whatever official, common, usual, chemical, or trade name is designated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. This section shall not apply to nonprescription or proprietary medicines as defined in RSA 318:1, XVIII.
