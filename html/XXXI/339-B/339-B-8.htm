&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-B:8 Gasoline Sales. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
It shall be unlawful for any person operating a retail gasoline station to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Display, or allow to be displayed on his premises, any sign, placard, or other advertisement relating to the retail price of gasoline unless numerals thereon indicating fractions or portions of a whole number are at least half the size of the largest whole number on such sign, and no such price of gasoline shall be advertised without the tax included.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Post a different price at one pump for the same grade of gasoline as is dispensed from another pump when both pumps are supplied from a common storage at the same service station and when the gasoline dispensed from both is represented to be and is sold as the same quality of gasoline;  provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit such price differences between a self-service and an attendant-operated pump supplied from a common storage as described hereinabove.
