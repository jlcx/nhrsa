&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a unit owner fails to pay the common expenses assessed to the unit by the unit owners' association within 60 days of the date it was due, the unit owners association may, as a separate and additional remedy, subject to the existing rights of a holder of a first mortgage of record as provided in this section, collect from any tenant renting the unit any rent then or thereafter due to the owner of such unit.  The unit owners' association shall apply such rent collected against the amount owed to it by the unit owner.  Prior to taking any action under this paragraph, the unit owners' association shall give to the delinquent unit owner written notice of its intent to collect the rent owed.  Such notice shall be sent by both first class and certified mail, shall set forth the exact amount the unit owners' association claims is due and owing by the unit owner, and shall indicate the intent of the association to collect such amount from rent, along with any other amounts which become due within the current fiscal year and which remain unpaid.  A copy of such notice shall be provided to any first mortgagee of record on such unit who has previously requested in writing that the unit owners' association notify it of any delinquency in the payment of amounts due to it by the owner of such unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The unit owner shall have 30 days from the date of mailing of such notice to pay the amounts due, including collection costs, or to provide proof of the prior payment of the assessments due.  No unit owner shall be entitled to withhold payment of assessments due, off-set against the same, or make any deduction therefrom without first obtaining a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the assessment was unlawful.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the unit owner fails to timely file a response in compliance with paragraphs I and II, the unit owners' association may notify and direct each tenant renting such unit from such owner to pay all or a portion of the rent otherwise due to such owner to the association, such rent or portion of such rent to be in the amount the association claimed is due on its notice to the unit owner or the full rent, whichever is less.  The association shall have a continuing right to collect any rent otherwise payable by the tenant to such unit owner until such amount, plus any charges thereafter becoming due, are satisfied in full.  Nothing in this section shall preclude the unit owner from seeking equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction or seeking a judicial determination of the amount owed.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the unit owners' association from bringing an action under this chapter or to otherwise establish the amount owed to it by the unit owner or otherwise to seek and obtain an order requiring the tenant in such unit, or tenants in other units owned by the unit owner in the condominium, to pay to the association rent otherwise due to the unit owner or otherwise limit the unit owner's association's rights at common law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In no event shall a unit owner take any retaliatory action against any tenant who pays rent, or any portion of rent, to the unit owners' association as provided in this section.  Any tenant so paying rent shall not be deemed in default on the rent to the extent of the payment to the association.  Any waiver of the provisions of this section in any lease or rental agreement shall be void and unenforceable as against public policy.
