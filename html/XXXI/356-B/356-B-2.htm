<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This chapter shall apply to all condominiums and to all condominium projects.  This chapter shall be deemed to supersede RSA 479-A, the New Hampshire Unit Ownership of Real Property Act;  and no condominium shall be established under the latter on or after September 10, 1977.  This chapter shall not be construed to affect the validity of any provision of any condominium instrument recorded prior to September 10, 1977.  Nor shall this chapter, except as set forth in paragraphs II and III, be deemed to apply to any real estate, or any interest therein, submitted to the provisions of RSA 479-A prior to September 10, 1977.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, this subdivision, General Principles, and subdivision IV, Administration and Enforcement, shall apply to any offer or disposition on or after November 1, 1981, of time sharing interests in condominium units established under RSA 479-A, regardless of the date on which such condominium units were created.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, if any condominium instrument recorded under RSA 479-A prior to September 10, 1977, shall be amended after September 10, 1977, for the purpose of creating 10 or more additional units in any such condominium project, this subdivision, General Principles, and subdivision IV, Administration and Enforcement, shall apply to said additional units.  If said amendment creates 10 or more, but less than 26, additional units, the applicant shall be permitted to make an abbreviated registration pursuant to RSA 356-B:51, II, and shall not be required to prepare a public offering statement pursuant to RSA 356-B:52;  provided, however, this sentence shall not apply if time sharing interests are offered with respect to such additional units.
