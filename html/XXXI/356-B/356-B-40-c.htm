<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board of directors, at least annually, shall adopt a proposed budget for the unit owners' association for consideration by the unit owners.  Not later than 30 days after adoption of a proposed budget, the board of directors shall provide to all the unit owners a summary of the budget, including any reserves, and a statement of the basis on which any reserves are calculated and funded.  Simultaneously, the board shall set a date not less than 10 days or more than 60 days after providing the summary for a meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the budget.  Unless at that meeting  2/3 of all unit owners or any larger number specified in the declaration reject the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present.  If a proposed budget is rejected, the budget last ratified by the unit owners continues until the unit owners ratify a subsequent budget.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of directors, at any time, may propose a special assessment.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph III, the assessment is effective only if the board of directors follows the procedures for ratification of a budget described in paragraph I and the unit owners do not reject the proposed assessment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the board of directors determines by a  2/3 vote that a special assessment is necessary to respond to an emergency:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The special assessment becomes effective immediately in accordance with the terms of the vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notice of the special assessment shall be provided promptly to all unit owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The board of directors may spend the funds paid on account of the special assessment only for the purposes described in the vote.
