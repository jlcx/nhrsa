I. The attorney general may make necessary public or private investigations in accordance with law within or outside of this state to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, or to aid in the enforcement of this chapter or in the prescribing of rules and forms hereunder.  In aid of such investigations, the attorney general may require or permit any person to file a statement in writing, under oath and subject to penalties of perjury or otherwise as the attorney general determines, as to all the circumstances concerning matters under investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this chapter, the attorney general or any officer designated by rule may administer oaths or affirmations and, upon his own motion or upon request of any party, shall subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any matter which is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge or relevant facts or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of material evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon failure to obey a subpoena or to answer questions propounded by the investigating officer and upon reasonable notice to all persons affected thereby, the attorney general may apply to the superior court for an order compelling compliance.
