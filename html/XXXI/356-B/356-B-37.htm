I. Meetings of the unit owners' association shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the condominium instruments at least once each year after the formation of said association.  The bylaws shall specify an officer who shall, at least 21 days in advance of any annual or regularly scheduled meeting, and at least 7 days in advance of any other meeting, send to each unit owner notice of the time, place, and purpose or purposes of such meeting.  Such notice shall be sent by first class United States mail to all unit owners of record at the address of their respective units and to such other addresses as any of them may have designated to such officer.  The secretary or other duly authorized officer of the unit owners' association, who shall also be a member of the board of directors of the unit owners' association, shall prepare an affidavit which shall be accompanied by a list of the addresses of all unit owners currently on file with the association and shall attest that notice of the association meeting was mailed to all unit owners on that list by first class mail.  A copy of the affidavit and mailing list shall be available at the noticed meeting for inspection by all owners then in attendance and shall be retained with the minutes of that meeting.  The affidavit required in this section shall be available for inspection by unit owners for at least 3 years after the date of the subject meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of directors shall make copies of the minutes of board meetings available to the unit owners within 60 days of the board meeting or 15 days of the date such minutes are approved by the board, whichever occurs first.  The unit owner shall be responsible for any copying costs, except that, if the association chooses to make the minutes available electronically, there shall be no charge to the unit owner.
