<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Meetings of the unit owners' association shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the condominium instruments at least once each year after the formation of the association.  The bylaws shall specify an officer who shall, at least 21 days in advance of any annual or regularly scheduled meeting, and at least 7 days in advance of any other meeting, provide to each unit owner notice of the time, place, and purpose or purposes of such meeting in conformity with RSA 356-B:37-a.  The minimum time to give notice may be reduced or waived for a meeting called to deal with an emergency.  Purposes of the meeting shall include any budget changes or proposal to remove an officer or member of the board of directors.  The secretary or other duly authorized officer of the unit owners' association, who shall also be a member of the board of directors of the unit owners' association, shall prepare an affidavit which shall be accompanied by a list of the addresses of all unit owners currently on file with the association and shall attest that notice of the association meeting was provided to all unit owners on that list in a manner conforming to RSA 356-B:37-a.  A copy of the affidavit and unit owners list shall be available at the noticed meeting for inspection by all owners then in attendance and shall be retained with the minutes of that meeting.  The affidavit required in this section shall be available for inspection by unit owners for at least 3 years after the date of the subject meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An association shall hold a special meeting of unit owners to address any matter affecting the unit owners or the association if its president, a majority of the board of directors, or unit owners having at least 33 percent, or any lower percentage specified in the bylaws, of the votes in the association request that the secretary call the meeting.  If the association does not notify unit owners of a special meeting within 30 days after the requisite number or percentage of unit owners request the secretary to do so, the requesting members may directly notify all the unit owners of an informational meeting, the purpose of which shall be to present the issue to fellow residents and unit owners.  Only matters described in the meeting notice required by RSA 356-B:37-a may be considered at a special meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as otherwise provided in the bylaws, meetings of the association shall be conducted in accordance with the most recent edition of Roberts' Rules of Order Newly Revised.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Unit owners shall be given a reasonable opportunity at any meeting to comment regarding any matter affecting the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The declaration or bylaws may allow for meetings of unit owners to be conducted by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process, as provided in RSA 356-B:37-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board of directors shall make copies of the minutes of all meetings available to the unit owners within 60 days of the meeting or 15 days of the date such minutes are approved by the board, whichever occurs first.  The association may opt to provide the minutes electronically or publish them on the association website, in which case the owners shall be informed of the web address.
