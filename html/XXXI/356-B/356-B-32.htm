&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:32 Subdivision of Units. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the condominium instruments expressly permit the subdivision of any units, then such units may be subdivided in accordance with (a) the provisions of this section and (b) any restrictions and limitations not otherwise unlawful which the condominium instruments may specify.  No unit shall be subdivided unless the condominium instruments expressly permit it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the unit owner of any unit which may be subdivided desires to subdivide a unit, then the principal officer of the unit owners' association, or such other officer or officers as the condominium instruments may specify, shall, upon written application of the subdivider, as such unit owner shall henceforth be referred to in this section, forthwith prepare and execute appropriate instruments pursuant to paragraphs III, IV and V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An amendment to the declaration shall assign new identifying numbers to the new units created by the subdivision of a unit and shall allocate to those units, on a reasonable basis acceptable to the subdivider, all of the undivided interest in the common areas appertaining to the subdivided unit.  The new units shall jointly share all rights, and shall be equally liable jointly and severally for all obligations, with regard to any limited common areas assigned to the subdivided unit except to the extent that the subdivider may have specified in his written application that all or any portions of any limited common area assigned to the subdivided unit exclusively should be assigned to one or more, but less than all of the new units, in which case the amendment to the declaration shall reflect the desires of the subdivider as expressed in such written application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. An amendment to the bylaws shall allocate to the new units, on a reasonable basis acceptable to the subdivider, the votes in the unit owners' association allocated to the subdivided unit and shall reflect a proportionate allocation to the new units of the liability for common expenses and right to common profits formerly appertaining to the subdivided unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Such site plans and floor plans as may be necessary to show the boundaries separating the new units together with their other boundaries shall be prepared, and the new units depicted on such plans shall bear their new identifying numbers.  Such site plans and floor plans shall indicate the dimensions of the new units, and the horizontal boundaries of such units, if any, shall be identified on such plans with reference to established datum.  Such site plans and floor plans shall be certified as to their accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this paragraph by a licensed land surveyor in the case of any site plan and by a registered architect, licensed land surveyor or registered engineer in the case of any floor plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When appropriate instruments in accordance with paragraphs III, IV and V have been prepared, executed, and acknowledged, they shall be delivered forthwith to the subdivider upon payment by the subdivider of all reasonable costs for the preparation and acknowledgment thereof.  Said instruments shall become effective when the subdivider has executed and recorded them, and the recordation thereof shall be conclusive evidence that the subdivision thus effectuated did not violate any restrictions or limitations specified by the condominium instruments and that any reallocations made pursuant to paragraphs III and IV were reasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 356-B:24, IV, this section shall have no application to convertible spaces, and no such space shall be deemed a unit for the purposes of this section.  However, this section shall apply to any units formed by the conversion of all or any portion of any such space, and any such unit shall be deemed a unit for the purposes of this section.
