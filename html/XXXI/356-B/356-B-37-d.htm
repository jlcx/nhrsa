&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:37-d Executive Session.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The board of directors and association committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee.  No final vote or action may be taken during an executive session.  An executive session may be held only to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Consult with the association's attorney.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Discuss labor or personnel matters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Discuss contracts, leases, and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage or prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the board of directors or a committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.
