&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A master liability policy, in an amount specified by the condominium instruments, covering the unit owners' association, the board of directors, if any, the managing agent, if any, all persons acting or who may come to act as agents or employees of any of the foregoing with respect to the condominium, and all unit owners and other persons entitled to occupy any unit or other portion of the condominium;  and
