&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:37-c Meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees of the Association.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following requirements apply to meetings of the board of directors and committees of the association authorized to act for the association:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For purposes of this section, a gathering of board members at which the board members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the board of directors.  The board of directors and its members may not use incidental or social gatherings of board members or any other method to evade the open meeting requirements of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Not less than once each quarter, and at such additional times as may be specified in the condominium bylaws, the board of directors shall, subject to the provisions of RSA 356-B:37-d, hold an open regular meeting during which unit owners shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to comment on any matter affecting the association.  At its discretion, the board of directors may meet in a meeting not open to unit owners provided the meeting is recorded and the recording is made available to unit owners for up to 30 days upon request.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners or the meeting is called to deal with an emergency, the secretary or other officer specified in the bylaws shall give notice of each meeting of the board of directors to each board member and to the unit owners.  The notice shall be given at least 10 days before the meeting and shall state the time, date, place, and agenda of the meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If any materials are distributed to the board of directors before the meeting, the board of directors at the same time shall make copies of those materials reasonably available to unit owners, except that the board of directors need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or matters that are to be considered in executive session.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In the case of self-managed community associations, meetings of the board of directors or committees expressly for purposes of implementation of decisions made in open meetings shall be exempt from the requirements of RSA 356-B:37, 356-B:37-a, and this section.
