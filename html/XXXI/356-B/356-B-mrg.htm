<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This chapter shall apply to all condominiums and to all condominium projects.  This chapter shall be deemed to supersede RSA 479-A, the New Hampshire Unit Ownership of Real Property Act;  and no condominium shall be established under the latter on or after September 10, 1977.  This chapter shall not be construed to affect the validity of any provision of any condominium instrument recorded prior to September 10, 1977.  Nor shall this chapter, except as set forth in paragraphs II and III, be deemed to apply to any real estate, or any interest therein, submitted to the provisions of RSA 479-A prior to September 10, 1977.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, this subdivision, General Principles, and subdivision IV, Administration and Enforcement, shall apply to any offer or disposition on or after November 1, 1981, of time sharing interests in condominium units established under RSA 479-A, regardless of the date on which such condominium units were created.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I, if any condominium instrument recorded under RSA 479-A prior to September 10, 1977, shall be amended after September 10, 1977, for the purpose of creating 10 or more additional units in any such condominium project, this subdivision, General Principles, and subdivision IV, Administration and Enforcement, shall apply to said additional units.  If said amendment creates 10 or more, but less than 26, additional units, the applicant shall be permitted to make an abbreviated registration pursuant to RSA 356-B:51, II, and shall not be required to prepare a public offering statement pursuant to RSA 356-B:52;  provided, however, this sentence shall not apply if time sharing interests are offered with respect to such additional units.

A condominium including leased land, or an interest therein, within which or on which no units are situated or to be situated shall not be deemed a leasehold condominium within the meaning of this chapter, nor shall a condominium be deemed to be a leasehold condominium solely because of the offering or disposition of time sharing interests therein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XX. "Limited common area'' means a portion of the common area reserved for the exclusive use of those entitled to the use of one or more, but less than all, of the units.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXV. "Publicly held corporation,'' "subsidiary corporation,'' "closely held corporation,'' "hearing'' and "broker'' have the same meaning as set forth in the respective definitions of such terms in RSA 356-A:1;  and "agent'' and "blanket encumbrance'' have the same meaning as set forth in the respective definitions of such terms in RSA 356-A:1, except that within such definitions references to "developer'' or "subdivider'' shall mean "declarant,'' references to "lot'' or "lots'' shall mean "unit'' or "units'' and references to "subdivision'' shall mean "condominium project.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Certain spaces within the units including, without limitation, attic, basement, and/or garage space may but need not be omitted from such calculation or partially discounted by the use of a ratio, so long as the same basis of calculation is employed for all units in the condominium, and so long as that basis is described in the declaration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXVIII. "Time sharing interest'' means the exclusive right to occupy one or more units for less than 60 days each year for a period of more than 5 years from the date of execution of an instrument for the disposition of such right, regardless of whether such right is accompanied by a fee simple interest or a leasehold interest, or neither of them, in a condominium unit.  Time sharing interest shall include "interval ownership interest,'' "vacation license'' or any other similar term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXIX. "Unit'' shall mean a portion of the condominium designed and intended for individual ownership and use.  For the purposes of this chapter, a convertible space shall be treated as a unit in accordance with RSA 356-B:24, IV.

XXX. "Unit owner'' means one or more persons who owns a condominium unit, or, in the case of a leasehold condominium, whose leasehold interest or interests in the condominium extend for the entire balance of the unexpired term or terms.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXXI. "Value'' means a number of dollars or points assigned to each unit by the declaration.  Substantially identical units shall be assigned the same value, but units located at substantially different heights above the ground, or having substantially different views, or having substantially different amenities or other characteristics that might result in differences in market value, may, but need not, be considered substantially identical within the meaning of this paragraph.  If value is stated in terms of dollars, that statement shall not be deemed to reflect or control the sales price or fair market value of any unit, and no opinion, appraisal, or fair market transaction at a different figure shall affect the value of any unit, or any undivided interest in the common area, voting rights in the unit owners' association, liability for common expenses, or rights to common profits, assigned on the basis thereof.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:4 Separate Titles and Taxation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Each condominium unit shall constitute for all purposes a separate parcel of real property, distinct from all other condominium units.  If there is any unit or units owned by any person other than the declarant, each such unit or units shall be subject to separate assessment and taxation by each assessing authority and special district for all types of taxes authorized by law.  Each unit in which time sharing interests, as defined in RSA 356-B:3, XXVIII, have been created shall be valued for purposes of real property taxation as if such unit were owned by a single taxpayer.  Condominium units in which time sharing interests have been created shall be taxed as wholly owned condominium units.  The total cumulative purchase price paid for time sharing interests in any such unit shall not be determinative of the unit's assessed value.  No taxes shall be assessed against the individual owner of a time sharing interest but shall be assessed against the record owner of such unit, the owners' association, trustee, or managing agent, as appropriate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:5 Municipal Ordinances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No zoning or other land use ordinance shall prohibit condominiums as such by reason of the form of ownership inherent therein.  Neither shall any condominium be treated differently by any zoning or other land use ordinance which would permit a physically identical project or development under a different form of ownership.  No subdivision ordinance in any city or town shall apply to any condominium or to any subdivision of any convertible land, convertible space, or unit unless such ordinance is by its express terms made applicable thereto.  Nevertheless, cities and towns may provide by ordinance that proposed conversion condominiums and the use thereof which do not conform to the zoning, land use and site plan regulations of the respective city or town in which the property is located shall secure a special use permit, a special exception, or variance, as the case may be, prior to becoming a conversion condominium.  In the event of an approved conversion to condominiums, cities, towns, village districts, or other political subdivisions may impose such charges and fees as are lawfully imposed by such political subdivisions as a result of construction of new structures to the extent that such charges and fees, or portions of such charges and fees, imposed upon property subject to such conversions may be reasonably related to greater or additional services provided by the political subdivision as a result of the conversion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:6 Eminent Domain. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If any portion of the common area is taken by eminent domain, the award therefor shall be allocated to the unit owners in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common area;  provided, however, that the portion of the award attributable to the taking of any permanently assigned limited common area shall be allocated by the decree to the unit owner of the unit to which that limited common area was so assigned at the time of the taking.  If that limited common area was permanently assigned to more than one unit at the time of the taking, then the portion of the award attributable to the taking thereof shall be allocated in equal shares to the unit owners of the units to which it was so assigned or in such other shares as the condominium instruments may specify for this express purpose.  A permanently assigned limited common area is a limited common area which cannot be reassigned or which can be reassigned only with the consent of the unit owner or owners of the unit or units to which it is assigned.  In the event of a taking or acquisition of a part or all of the common areas by a condemning authority, the statutory notices of hearing shall be served on the unit owners' association acting on behalf of all of the unit owners at least 30 days prior to such hearing, and the award or proceeds of settlement shall be payable to the unit owners' association for the use and benefit of the unit owners and their mortgagees as their interest may appear in accordance with this section.  The unit owners' association shall represent the unit owners in any condemnation proceedings or in negotiations, settlements and agreements with the condemning authorities for acquisition of the common areas or any part thereof and the unit owners' association shall act as attorney-in-fact for each unit owner for the purposes of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If one or more units are taken by eminent domain, the undivided interest in the common area appertaining to any such unit shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common area.  The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include, without limitation, just compensation to the unit owner of any unit taken for his undivided interest in the common area as well as for his unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If portions of any unit are taken by eminent domain, the court shall determine the fair market value of the portions of such unit not taken and the undivided interest in the common area appertaining to any such units shall be reduced, in the case of each such unit, in proportion to the diminution in the fair market value of such unit resulting from the taking.  The portions of undivided interest in the common area thereby divested from the unit owners of any such units shall be reallocated among those units and the other units in the condominium in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common area, with any units partially taken participating in such reallocation on the basis of their undivided interests as reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence.  The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include, without limitation, just compensation to the unit owner of any unit partially taken for that portion of his undivided interest in the common area divested from him by operation of the first sentence of this paragraph and not revested in him by operation of the following sentence, as well as for that portion of his unit taken by eminent domain.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If, however, the taking of a portion of any unit makes it impractical to use the remaining portion of that unit for any lawful purpose permitted by the condominium instruments, then the entire undivided interest in the common area appertaining to that unit shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common area, and the remaining portion of that unit shall thenceforth be common area.  The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include, without limitation, just compensation to the unit owner of such unit for his entire undivided interest in the common area and for his entire unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Votes in the unit owners' association, rights to future common profits, and liabilities for future common expenses not specially assessed, appertaining to any unit or units taken or partially taken by eminent domain, shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their relative voting strength in the unit owners' association, with any units partially taken participating in such reallocation as though their voting strength in the unit owners' association has been reduced in proportion to their reduction in their undivided interests in the common area, and the decree of the court shall provide accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The decree of the court shall require recordation thereof in the registry of deeds of the county in which the condominium is located.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:7 Creation of Condominium. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No condominium shall come into existence except by the recordation of condominium instruments pursuant to this chapter.  No condominium instruments shall be recorded unless all units located or to be located on any portion of the submitted land, other than within the boundaries of any convertible lands, are depicted on site plans and floor plans that comply with RSA 356-B:20, I and II.  The foreclosure of any mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to terminate the condominium.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if a rent increase is made in accordance with RSA 356-C:3, I(a)(12), application for condominium conversion shall not be made until 3 months after such increase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:8 Release of Liens. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At the time of the conveyance to the first purchaser of each condominium unit following the recordation of the declaration, every mortgage, deed of trust, any perfected mechanics' or materialmen's liens, or any other perfected lien, affecting all of the condominium or a greater portion thereof than the condominium unit conveyed, shall be paid and satisfied of record, or the declarant shall forthwith have the said condominium unit released of record from all such liens not so paid and satisfied.  This paragraph shall not apply, however, to any withdrawable land in a contractable condominium, nor shall any provision of this paragraph be construed to prohibit the unit owners' association from mortgaging or causing a deed of trust to be placed on any portion of the condominium within which no units are located, so long as any time limit specified pursuant to RSA 356-B:36 has expired, and so long as the bylaws authorize the same.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Subsequent to recording the declaration as provided in this chapter, no lien or encumbrance shall thereafter arise against the condominium as a whole, but only against each unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas appurtenant to such unit, in the same manner and under the same conditions in every respect as liens or encumbrances may arise or be created upon or against any other separate parcel of real property subject to individual ownership;  provided that no labor performed or materials furnished with the consent or at the request of a unit owner or his agent or his contractor or subcontractor shall be the basis for the filing of a lien pursuant to the lien law against the unit or any other property of any other unit owner not expressly consenting to or requesting the same, except that such express consent shall be deemed to be given by the owner of any unit in the case of emergency repairs thereto.  Labor performed or materials furnished for the common areas, if duly authorized by the association of unit owners or board of directors in accordance with this chapter, the declaration or bylaws, shall be deemed to be performed or furnished with the express consent of each unit owner and shall be the basis for the filing of a lien pursuant to the lien law against each of the units and shall be subject to the provisions of this section.  In the event a lien against 2 or more units becomes effective, the unit owners of the separate units may remove their unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas appurtenant to such unit from the lien by payment of the fractional or proportional amounts attributable to each of the units affected.  Such individual payment shall be computed by reference to the percentages appearing on the declaration.  Subsequent to any such payment, discharge or other satisfaction, the unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas appurtenant thereto shall thereafter be free and clear of the lien so paid, satisfied or discharged.  Such partial payment, satisfaction or discharge shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce his rights against any unit and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas appurtenant thereto not so paid, satisfied or discharged.  This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the declarant from mortgaging or causing a deed of trust to be placed on any portion of convertible lands for the purpose of financing construction thereon.

Acquisition or reacquisition of such a leasehold interest by the owner of the reversion or remainder shall not cause a merger of the leasehold and fee simple interests unless all leasehold interests in the condominium are thus acquired or reacquired.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Wherever this section requires a legal description by metes and bounds of land that is submitted to this chapter or that may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, such requirement shall be deemed satisfied by any legally sufficient description and shall be deemed to require a legally sufficient description of any easements that are submitted to this chapter or that may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, as the case may be.  In the case of each such easement, the declaration shall contain the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Wherever this section requires a legal description by metes and bounds of land that is submitted to this chapter or that may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, an added requirement shall be a separate legally sufficient description of all lands in which the unit owners shall or may be tenants in common or joint tenants with any other persons, and a separate legally sufficient description of all lands in which the unit owners shall or may be life tenants.  No units shall be situated on any such lands, however, and the declaration shall describe the nature of the unit owner's estate therein.  No such lands shall be shown on the same site plans showing other portions of the condominium, but shall be shown instead on separate site plans.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:17 Allocation of Interests in the Common Areas. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The declaration may allocate to each unit depicted on site plans and floor plans that comply with RSA 356-B:20, I and II an undivided interest in the common areas proportionate to either the size or value of each unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Otherwise, the declaration shall allocate to each such unit an equal undivided interest in the common areas subject to the following exception:  each convertible space so depicted shall be allocated an undivided interest in the common areas proportionate to the size of each such space, vis-a-vis the aggregate size of all units so depicted, while the remaining undivided interests in the common areas shall be allocated equally to the other units so depicted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The undivided interests in the common areas allocated in accordance with paragraph I or II shall add up to one if stated as fractions or 100 percentum if stated as percentages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If, in accordance with paragraph I or II, an equal undivided interest in the common areas is allocated to each unit, the declaration may simply state that fact and need not express the fraction or percentage so allocated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Otherwise, the undivided interest allocated to each unit in accordance with paragraph I or II shall be reflected by a table in the declaration, or by an exhibit or schedule accompanying the declaration and recorded simultaneously therewith, containing 3 columns.  The first column shall identify the units, listing them serially or grouping them together in the case of units to which identical undivided interests are allocated.  Corresponding figures in the second and third columns shall set forth the respective areas or values of those units and the fraction or percentage of undivided interest in the common areas allocated thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided by this chapter, the amount of undivided interest in the common areas allocated to any unit shall not be altered, and any purported transfer, encumbrance or other disposition of that interest without the unit to which it appertains shall be void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The common areas shall not be subject to any suit for partition until and unless the condominium is terminated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:18 Reallocation of Interests in the Common Areas. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a condominium contains any convertible land or is an expandable condominium, then the declaration shall not allocate undivided interests in the common areas on the basis of value unless the declaration:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Prohibits the creation of any units not substantially identical to the units depicted on the site plans and floor plans recorded pursuant to RSA 356-B:20, I and II;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prohibits the creation of any units not described pursuant to RSA 356-B:16, II(f) (in the case of convertible lands) and RSA 356-B:16, III(l) (in the case of additional land), and contains from the outset a statement of the value that shall be assigned to every such unit that may be created.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Interests in the common areas shall not be allocated to any units to be created within any convertible land or within any additional land until site plans and floor plans depicting the same are recorded pursuant to RSA 356-B:20, III.  But simultaneously with the recording of such site plans and floor plans the declarant shall execute and record an amendment to the declaration reallocating undivided interests in the common areas so that the units depicted on such site plans and floor plans shall be allocated undivided interests in the common areas on the same basis as the units depicted on the site plans and floor plans recorded simultaneously with the declaration pursuant to RSA 356-B:20, I and II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If all of a convertible space is converted into common areas, including without limitation limited common areas, then the undivided interest in the common areas appertaining to such space shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated among them in proportion to their undivided interests in the common areas.  The principal officer of the unit owners' association, or such other officer or officers as the condominium instruments may specify, shall forthwith prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the case of a leasehold condominium, if the expiration or termination of any lease causes a contraction of the condominium which reduces the number of units, then the undivided interest in the common areas appertaining to any units thereby withdrawn from the condominium shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated among them in proportion to their undivided interests in the common areas.  The principal officer of the unit owners' association, or such other officer or officers as the condominium instruments may specify, shall forthwith prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:19 Assignments of Limited Common Areas. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All assignments and reassignments of limited common areas shall be reflected by the condominium instruments.  No limited common area shall be assigned or reassigned except in accordance with this chapter.  No amendment to any condominium instrument shall alter any rights or obligations with respect to any limited common area without the consent of all unit owners adversely affected thereby as evidenced by their execution of such amendment, except to the extent that the condominium instruments expressly provided otherwise prior to the first assignment of that limited common area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unless expressly prohibited by the condominium instruments, a limited common area may be reassigned upon written application of the unit owners concerned to the principal officer of the unit owners' association, or to such other officer or officers as the condominium instruments may specify.  The officer or officers to whom such application is duly made shall forthwith prepare and execute an amendment to the declaration reassigning all rights and obligations with respect to the limited common area involved.  Such amendment shall be delivered forthwith to the unit owners of the units concerned upon payment by them of all reasonable costs for the preparation and acknowledgment thereof.  Said amendment shall become effective when the unit owners of the units concerned have executed and recorded it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A common area not previously assigned as a limited common area shall be so assigned only pursuant to RSA 356-B:16, I(f), except that limited common areas may be created or expanded pursuant to an amendment to the condominium instruments consented to by  2/3 of the votes in the unit owners association, or such higher percentage as the condominium instruments may provide, and then thereafter assigned as therein provided.  The amendment to the declaration making such an assignment shall be prepared and executed by the principal officer of the unit owners' association, or by such other officer or officers as the condominium instruments may specify.  Such amendment shall be delivered to the unit owner or owners of the unit or units concerned upon payment by them of all reasonable costs for the preparation and acknowledgment thereof.  Said amendment shall become effective when the aforesaid unit owner or owners have executed and recorded it, and the recordation thereof shall be conclusive evidence that the method prescribed pursuant to RSA 356-B:16, I(f) was adhered to. The creation or expansion of limited common areas pursuant to this paragraph shall not alter the amount of undivided interest in the common areas allocated to any unit.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There shall be recorded simultaneously with the declaration one or more site plans of survey showing the location and dimensions of the submitted land, the location and dimensions of any convertible lands within the submitted land, the location and dimensions of any existing improvements, the intended location and dimensions of any contemplated improvements which are to be located on any portion of the submitted land other than within the boundaries of any convertible lands, and, to the extent feasible, the location and dimensions of all easements appurtenant to the submitted land or otherwise submitted to this chapter as a part of the common areas.  If the submitted land is not contiguous, then the site plans shall indicate the distance between the parcels constituting the submitted land.  The site plans shall label every convertible land as a convertible land, and if there be more than one such land the site plans shall label each such land with one or more letters or numbers or both different from those designating any other convertible land and different also from the identifying number of any unit.  The site plans shall show the location and dimensions of any withdrawable lands, and shall label each such land as a withdrawable land.  If, with respect to any portion or portions, but less than all, of the submitted land, the unit owners are to own only an estate for years, the site plans shall show the location and dimensions of any such portions, and shall label each such portion as a leased land.  If there is more than one withdrawable land, or more than one leased land, the site plans shall label each such land with one or more letters or numbers or both different from those designating any convertible land or other withdrawable or leased land, and different also from the identifying number of any unit.  The site plans shall show all easements to which the submitted land or any portion thereof is subject, and shall show the location and dimensions of all such easements to the extent feasible.  The site plans shall also show all encroachments by or on any portion of the condominium.  In the case of any improvements located or to be located on any portion of the submitted land other than within the boundaries of any convertible lands, the site plans shall indicate which, if any, have not been begun by the use of the phrase "(NOT YET BEGUN)'' and which, if any, have been begun but have not been substantially completed by the use of the phrase "(NOT YET COMPLETED).''  In the case of any units the vertical boundaries of which lie wholly or partially outside of structures for which floor plans pursuant to paragraph II are simultaneously recorded, the site plans shall show the location and dimensions of such vertical boundaries to the extent that they are not shown on such floor plans, and the units or portions thereof thus depicted shall bear their identifying numbers.  Each site plan shall be certified as to its accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this paragraph by a registered land surveyor, and the said surveyor shall certify that all units or portions thereof depicted on any portion of the submitted land other than within the boundaries of any convertible lands have been substantially completed.  The specification within this paragraph of items that shall be shown on the site plans shall not be construed to mean that the site plans shall not also show all other items customarily shown or hereafter required for land title surveys.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There shall also be recorded, simultaneously with the declaration, floor plans of every structure which contains or constitutes all or part of any unit or units, and which is located on any portion of the submitted land other than within the boundaries of any convertible lands.  The floor plans shall show the location and dimensions of the vertical boundaries of each unit to the extent that such boundaries lie within or coincide with the boundaries of such structures, and the units or portions thereof thus depicted shall bear their identifying numbers.  In addition, each convertible space thus depicted shall be labeled a convertible space.  The horizontal boundaries of each unit having horizontal boundaries shall be identified on the floor plans with reference to established datum.  Unless the condominium instruments expressly provide otherwise, it shall be presumed that in the case of any unit not wholly contained within or constituting one or more such structures, the horizontal boundaries thus identified extend, in the case of each such unit, at the same elevation with regard to any part of such unit lying outside of such structures, subject to the following exception:  in the case of any such unit which does not lie over any other unit other than basement units, it shall be presumed that the lower horizontal boundary, if any, of that unit lies at the level of the ground with regard to any part of that unit lying outside of such structures.  The floor plans shall be certified as to their accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this paragraph by a registered architect, registered engineer or licensed land surveyor, and such architect, engineer or land surveyor shall certify that all units or portions of units depicted on the floor plan have been substantially completed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When converting all or any portion of any convertible land, or adding additional land to an expandable condominium, the declarant shall record new site plans of survey conforming to the requirements of paragraph I.  (In any case where less than all of a convertible land is being converted, such site plans shall show the location and dimensions of the remaining portion or portions of such land in addition to otherwise conforming with the requirements of paragraph I.) At the same time, the declarant shall record, with regard to any structures on the land being converted, or added, either floor plans conforming to the requirements of paragraph II, or certifications, conforming to the certification requirements of said subsection, of floor plans previously recorded pursuant to RSA 356-B:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When converting all or any portion of any convertible space into one or more units or limited common areas, or both, the declarant shall record, with regard to the structure or portion of such structure constituting that convertible space, floor plans showing the location and dimensions of the horizontal and vertical boundaries of each unit or limited common areas, or both, formed out of such space.  Such plans shall be certified as to their accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this paragraph by a registered architect, registered engineer or licensed land surveyor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. For the purposes of paragraphs I, II and III, all provisions and requirements relating to units shall be deemed equally applicable to limited common areas.  The limited common areas shall be labeled as such, and each limited common area depicted on the site plans and floor plans shall bear the identifying number or numbers of the unit or units to which it is assigned, if it has been assigned, unless the provisions of RSA 356-B:12, V, make such designations unnecessary.

Until the expiration of the period during which conversion may occur or until actual conversion, whichever occurs first, real estate taxes shall be assessed against the declarant rather than the unit owners as to both the convertible land and any improvements thereon.  No such conversion shall occur after 5 years from the recordation of the declaration, or such shorter period of time period as the declaration may specify, provided, however, that the time limit contained in the declaration may be extended by not more than 5 years by an amendment to the declaration adopted pursuant to RSA 356-B:54, V.

<center><h3>Section 356-B:35</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:35 Contents of the Bylaws. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There shall be recorded simultaneously with the declaration a set of bylaws providing for the self-government of the condominium by an association of all the unit owners.  The unit owners' association may be incorporated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The bylaws shall provide whether or not the unit owners' association shall elect a board of directors.  If there is to be such a board, the bylaws shall specify the powers and responsibilities of the same and the number and terms of its members.  The bylaws may delegate to such board, among other things, any of the powers and responsibilities assigned by this chapter to the unit owners' association.  The bylaws shall also specify which, if any, of its powers and responsibilities the unit owners' association or its board may delegate to a managing agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In any case where an amendment to the declaration is required by RSA 356-B:18, II, III or IV, the person or persons required to execute the same shall also prepare and execute, and record simultaneously with such amendment, an amendment to the bylaws.  The amendment to the bylaws shall allocate votes in the unit owners' association to new units on the same basis as was used for the allocation of such votes to the units depicted on site plans and floor plans recorded pursuant to RSA 356-B:20, I and II, or shall abolish the votes appertaining to former units, as the case may be.  The amendment to the bylaws shall also reallocate rights to future common profits, and liabilities for future common expenses not specially assessed, in proportion to relative voting strengths as reflected by the said amendment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The bylaws shall provide that the unit owners' association shall act on behalf of each unit owner in condemnation proceedings against the common areas of the condominium.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:36 Control by the Declarant. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The condominium instruments may authorize the declarant, or a managing agent or some other person or persons selected or to be selected by the declarant, to appoint and remove some or all of the officers of the unit owners' association or its board of directors, or both, or to exercise powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned by the condominium instruments and by this chapter to the unit owners' association, the officers, or the board of directors.  But no amendment to the condominium instruments shall increase the scope of such authorization if there is any unit owner other than the declarant, and no such authorization shall be valid after the time limit set by the condominium instruments or after units to which  3/4 of the undivided interests in the common areas appertain have been conveyed, whichever occurs first.  The time limit initially set by the condominium instruments shall not exceed 5 years in the case of an expandable condominium, 3 years in the case of a condominium containing any convertible land, or 2 years in the case of any other condominium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If entered into during the period of control contemplated by paragraph I, no management contract, lease of recreational areas or facilities, or any other contract or lease executed by or on behalf of the unit owners' association, its board of directors, or the unit owners as a group, shall be binding after such period of control unless then renewed or ratified with the consent of unit owners of units to which a majority of the votes in the unit owners' association appertain.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the unit owners' association is not in existence or does not have officers at the time of the creation of the condominium, the declarant shall, until there is such an association with such officers, have the power and the responsibility to act in all instances where this chapter requires action by the unit owners' association, its board of directors, or any officer or officers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This section shall be strictly construed to protect the rights of the unit owners.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:37 Meetings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Meetings of the unit owners' association shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the condominium instruments at least once each year after the formation of said association.  The bylaws shall specify an officer who shall, at least 21 days in advance of any annual or regularly scheduled meeting, and at least 7 days in advance of any other meeting, send to each unit owner notice of the time, place, and purpose or purposes of such meeting.  Such notice shall be sent by first class United States mail to all unit owners of record at the address of their respective units and to such other addresses as any of them may have designated to such officer.  The secretary or other duly authorized officer of the unit owners' association, who shall also be a member of the board of directors of the unit owners' association, shall prepare an affidavit which shall be accompanied by a list of the addresses of all unit owners currently on file with the association and shall attest that notice of the association meeting was mailed to all unit owners on that list by first class mail.  A copy of the affidavit and mailing list shall be available at the noticed meeting for inspection by all owners then in attendance and shall be retained with the minutes of that meeting.  The affidavit required in this section shall be available for inspection by unit owners for at least 3 years after the date of the subject meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of directors shall make copies of the minutes of board meetings available to the unit owners within 60 days of the board meeting or 15 days of the date such minutes are approved by the board, whichever occurs first.  The unit owner shall be responsible for any copying costs, except that, if the association chooses to make the minutes available electronically, there shall be no charge to the unit owner.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless the condominium instruments otherwise provide, a quorum shall be deemed to be present throughout any meeting of the unit owners' association until adjourned if persons entitled to cast more than 33 1/3 percent of the votes are present at the beginning of such meeting.  The bylaws may provide for a larger percentage, or for a smaller percentage not less than 25 percent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:39 Voting. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The bylaws may allocate to each unit depicted on site plans and floor plans that comply with RSA 356-B:20, I and II, a number of votes in the unit owners' association proportionate to the undivided interest in the common areas appertaining to each such unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Otherwise, the bylaws shall allocate to each such unit an equal number of votes in the unit owners' association, subject to the following exception:  each convertible space so depicted shall be allocated a number of votes in the unit owners' association proportionate to the size of each such space, vis-a-vis the aggregate size of all units so depicted, while the remaining votes in the unit owners' association shall be allocated equally to the other units so depicted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Since a unit owner may be more than one person, if only one of such persons is present at a meeting of the unit owners' association, that person shall be entitled to cast the votes appertaining to that unit.  But if more than one of such persons is present, the vote appertaining to that unit shall be cast only in accordance with their unanimous agreement unless the condominium instruments expressly provide otherwise, and such consent shall be conclusively presumed if any one of them purports to cast the votes appertaining to that unit without protest being made forthwith by any of the others to the person presiding over the meeting.  Since a person need not be a natural person, the word "person'' shall be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to include, without limitation, any natural person having authority to execute deeds on behalf of any person, excluding natural persons, which is, either alone or in conjunction with another person or persons, a unit owner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The votes appertaining to any unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy or proxies duly executed by or on behalf of the unit owner, or, in cases where the unit owner is more than one person, by or on behalf of all such persons.  The proxy or proxies shall list the name of the person who is to vote.  No such proxy shall be revocable except by actual notice to the person presiding over the meeting, by the unit owner or by any of such persons, that it be revoked.  Any proxy shall be void if it is not dated or if it purports to be revocable without notice as aforesaid.  The proxy of any person shall be void if not signed by a person having authority, at the time of the execution thereof, to execute deeds on behalf of that person.  Any proxy shall terminate automatically upon the adjournment of the first meeting held on or after the date of that proxy.  The board of directors of the unit owners' association shall devise procedures to assure that all proxies voted at any meeting are valid and were duly executed by association members having the right to vote.  Those procedures shall include one of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The board of directors shall deliver to the unit owners, together with their notice of meeting and agenda, proxy forms bearing a control number which the board of directors shall correlate to the list of all unit owners then entitled to vote.  At the noticed meeting, the board of directors shall recover all proxies and compare them to the control list maintained for that purpose.  Any proxies which are on a form other than that provided by the board of directors or which do not correlate with the control list maintained by the board of directors shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a quorum was present at the meeting and for purposes of casting any vote at that meeting;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The board of directors shall recover at any duly noticed meeting all original proxies delivered to any person for purposes of voting at that meeting.  The board of directors shall then independently confirm the validity of those proxies by selecting a random sample of not less than 10 percent of all original proxies returned to the board of directors at the meeting and confirm with the granting owners in writing that the proxy was voluntarily given and duly signed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board of directors shall retain all proxies delivered to the board of directors and all independent written confirmation of any such proxies for inspection by the unit owners for a period of not less than 3 years from the date of the subject owners' association meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If 50 percent or more of the votes in the unit owners' association appertain to 25 percent or less of the units, then in any case where a majority vote is required by the condominium instruments or by this chapter, the requirement for such a majority shall be deemed to include, in addition to the specified majority of the votes, assent by the unit owners of a like majority of the units.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, no votes in the unit owners' association shall be deemed to appertain to any condominium unit during such time as the unit owner thereof is the unit owners' association.

I. If the condominium instruments provide that any officer or officers must be unit owners, then any such officer who disposes of all of his units in fee and/or for a term or terms of more than one year shall be deemed to have disqualified himself from continuing in office unless the condominium instruments otherwise provide, or unless he acquires or contracts to acquire another unit in the condominium under terms giving him a right of occupancy thereto effective on or before the termination of his right of occupancy under such disposition or dispositions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the condominium instruments provide that any officer or officers must be unit owners, then notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 356-B:12, I, the term "unit owner'' in such context shall, unless the condominium instruments otherwise provide, be deemed to include, without limitation, any director, officer, partner in, or trustee of any person which is, either alone or in conjunction with another person or persons, a unit owner.  Any officer who would not be eligible to serve as such were he not director, officer, partner in, or trustee of such a person shall be deemed to have disqualified himself from continuing in office if he ceases to have any such affiliation with that person, or if that person would itself have been deemed to have disqualified itself from continuing in such office under paragraph I were it a natural person holding such office.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any officer is a suitable person to receive service of process in any proceeding against the association.

I. Except to the extent otherwise provided by the condominium instruments, all powers and responsibilities with regard to maintenance, repair, renovation, restoration, and replacement of the condominium shall belong (a) to the unit owners' association in the case of the common areas, and (b) to the individual unit owner in the case of any unit or any part thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. No unit owners' association, its agents, or its employees shall willfully enter into the unit of a unit owner without providing prior notice to the owner, other than for emergency purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. No unit owner, tenant, or other person occupying a condominium unit shall willfully refuse the unit owners' association, its agents, or its employees access through a condominium unit as is necessary to enable them to exercise and discharge their respective powers and responsibilities at a reasonable time after notice which is adequate under the circumstances.  But to the extent that damage is inflicted on the common areas or any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner causing the same, or the unit owners' association if it caused the same, shall be liable for the prompt repair thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the declarant shall warrant or guarantee, against structural defects, each of the units for one year from the date each is conveyed, and all of the common areas for one year.  The one year referred to in the preceding sentence shall begin as to each of the common areas whenever the same has been completed or if later, (a) as to any common area within any additional land or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed, (b) as to any common area within any convertible land or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed, and (c) as to any common area within any other portion of the condominium at the time the first unit therein is conveyed.  For the purposes of this paragraph, no unit shall be deemed conveyed unless conveyed to a bona fide purchaser.  For the purposes of this paragraph, structural defects shall be those defects in components constituting any unit or common area which reduce the stability or safety of the structure below accepted standards or restrict the normal intended use of all or part of the structure and which require repair, renovation, restoration, or replacement.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to make the declarant responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common areas.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A master liability policy, in an amount specified by the condominium instruments, covering the unit owners' association, the board of directors, if any, the managing agent, if any, all persons acting or who may come to act as agents or employees of any of the foregoing with respect to the condominium, and all unit owners and other persons entitled to occupy any unit or other portion of the condominium;  and

To the extent that the condominium instruments expressly so provide, any other common expenses benefiting less than all of the condominium units, or caused by the conduct of less than all those entitled to occupy the same or by their licensees or invitees, shall be specially assessed against the condominium unit or units involved, in accordance with such reasonable provisions as the condominium instruments may make for such cases.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The amount of all common expenses not specially assessed pursuant to paragraphs I and II, less the amount of all common profits, shall be assessed against the condominium units in proportion to the number of votes in the unit owners' association appertaining to each such unit.  Such assessments shall be made by the unit owners' association annually, or more often if the condominium instruments so provide.  No change in the number of votes in the unit owners' association appertaining to any condominium unit shall enlarge, diminish, or otherwise affect any liabilities arising from assessments made prior to such change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:46 Lien for Assessments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The unit owners' association shall have a lien on every condominium unit for unpaid assessments levied against that condominium unit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and all lawful provisions of the condominium instruments, if perfected as hereinafter provided.  The said lien, once perfected, shall be prior to all other liens and encumbrances except (1) real estate tax liens on that condominium unit, (2) liens and encumbrances recorded prior to the recordation of the declaration, and (3) sums unpaid on any first mortgages or first deeds of trust encumbering that condominium unit and securing institutional lenders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the priority of mechanics' and materialmen's liens.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), the lien for regular monthly common assessments unpaid with respect to a residential condominium unit during the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of the memorandum specified in paragraph III, together with all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees, shall be prior to the first mortgage;  provided that the unit owners' association sends, within 70 days of the occurrence of any delinquency, the unit owner and the institutional lender holding the first mortgage written notice of the delinquency by certified mail and first class mail that the account is at least 60 days delinquent;  and additionally, sends such lender notice by certified mail and first class mail, at least 30 days prior, of its intent to file said memorandum of lien.  The lien shall not include any amounts attributable to special assessments, late charges, fines, penalties, or interest assessed by the unit owners' association, nor shall the lien apply to regular assessments or costs of collection coming due prior to the effective date of this section.  In giving the foregoing notices, the unit owners' association may rely on the records of the applicable registry of deeds as to the address of the first institutional lender unless such lender has notified the unit owners' association by certified mail of a different address.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The priority lien rights established under subparagraph (c) shall not entitle or permit the unit owners' association to assert more than one priority lien unless and until the existing priority lien is first discharged by the unit owners' association.  The priority lien rights established under subparagraph (c) also shall not apply to any mortgage executed prior to the effective date of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) After notification to the first mortgage institutional lender of a delinquency, in addition to any previously agreed to or required escrow amounts, the institutional lender may also require a residential unit owner to place an amount equal to not more than 6 months of current regular assessments in escrow to cover the cost of any delinquency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any other provision of law, all memoranda of liens arising under this section shall be recorded in the registry of deeds in each county in which any part of the condominium is located.  Such memorandum shall be indexed in the general index to deeds, and such general index shall identify the lien as a lien for condominium assessments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The unit owners' association, in order to perfect the lien given by this section, shall file, before the expiration of 6 months from the time such assessment became due and payable in the registry of deeds in the county in which such condominium is situated, a memorandum, verified by the oath of the principal officer of the unit owners' association, or such other officer or officers as the condominium instruments may specify, which contains the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A description of the condominium unit in accordance with RSA 356-B:9;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The name or names of the persons constituting the unit owners of that condominium unit;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The amount of unpaid assessments currently due or past due together with the date when each fell due;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The date of issuance of the memorandum.
<br>
It shall be the duty of the register in whose office such memorandum shall be filed as hereinabove provided to record and index the same as provided in paragraph II, in the names of the persons identified therein as well as in the name of the unit owners' association.  The cost of recording such memorandum shall be taxed against the person found liable in any judgment or decree enforcing such lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No suit to enforce any lien perfected under paragraph III shall be brought after 6 years from the time when the memorandum of lien was recorded;  provided, however, that the filing of a petition to enforce any such lien in any suit wherein such petition may be properly filed shall be regarded as the institution of a suit under this section;  and provided further that nothing herein shall extend the time within which any such lien may be perfected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The judgment or decree in an action brought pursuant to this section shall include, without limitation, reimbursement for costs and attorneys' fees, together with interest at the maximum lawful rate for the sums secured by the lien from the time such sum became due and payable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When payment or satisfaction is made of a debt secured by the lien perfected by paragraph III, said lien shall be released in the same manner as required by RSA 479:7 for mortgages.  For the purposes of this section, the principal officer of the unit owners' association, or such other officer or officers as the condominium instruments may specify, shall be deemed the duly authorized agent of the lien creditor and shall discharge said lien.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit actions at law to recover sums for which paragraph I creates a lien, maintainable pursuant to RSA 356-B:15.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any unit owner or purchaser of a condominium unit, having executed a contract for the disposition of the same, shall be entitled upon request to a recordable statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments currently levied against that unit.  Such request shall be in writing, directed to the principal officer of the unit owners' association or to such other officer as the condominium instruments may specify.  Failure to furnish or make available such a statement within 10 business days from the receipt of such request shall extinguish the lien created by paragraph I as to the condominium unit involved.  Such statement shall be binding on the unit owners' association, the board of directors, and every unit owner.  Payment of a fee not exceeding $10 may be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of such a statement if the condominium instruments so provide.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Notwithstanding any law, rule, or provision of the condominium declaration, bylaws, or rules to the contrary, the unit owners' association may authorize, pursuant to RSA 356-B, its board of directors to, after 30 days' prior written notice to the unit owner and unit owner's first mortgagee of nonpayment of common assessments, terminate the delinquent unit's common privileges and cease supplying a delinquent unit with any and all services normally supplied or paid for by the unit owners' association.  Any terminated services and privileges shall be restored upon payment of all assessments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The unit owners' association may collect an amount of up to 6 months' common expense assessments in advance from unit owners and hold the amount so collected in escrow and, upon default by any unit owner in the payment of common expense assessments, apply the same to cure such default.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:46-a Rent Collection Upon Delinquency in Payment of Common Expenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
On and after January 1, 1998:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a unit owner fails to pay the common expenses assessed to the unit by the unit owners' association within 60 days of the date it was due, the unit owners association may, as a separate and additional remedy, subject to the existing rights of a holder of a first mortgage of record as provided in this section, collect from any tenant renting the unit any rent then or thereafter due to the owner of such unit.  The unit owners' association shall apply such rent collected against the amount owed to it by the unit owner.  Prior to taking any action under this paragraph, the unit owners' association shall give to the delinquent unit owner written notice of its intent to collect the rent owed.  Such notice shall be sent by both first class and certified mail, shall set forth the exact amount the unit owners' association claims is due and owing by the unit owner, and shall indicate the intent of the association to collect such amount from rent, along with any other amounts which become due within the current fiscal year and which remain unpaid.  A copy of such notice shall be provided to any first mortgagee of record on such unit who has previously requested in writing that the unit owners' association notify it of any delinquency in the payment of amounts due to it by the owner of such unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The unit owner shall have 30 days from the date of mailing of such notice to pay the amounts due, including collection costs, or to provide proof of the prior payment of the assessments due.  No unit owner shall be entitled to withhold payment of assessments due, off-set against the same, or make any deduction therefrom without first obtaining a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the assessment was unlawful.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the unit owner fails to timely file a response in compliance with paragraphs I and II, the unit owners' association may notify and direct each tenant renting such unit from such owner to pay all or a portion of the rent otherwise due to such owner to the association, such rent or portion of such rent to be in the amount the association claimed is due on its notice to the unit owner or the full rent, whichever is less.  The association shall have a continuing right to collect any rent otherwise payable by the tenant to such unit owner until such amount, plus any charges thereafter becoming due, are satisfied in full.  Nothing in this section shall preclude the unit owner from seeking equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction or seeking a judicial determination of the amount owed.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the unit owners' association from bringing an action under this chapter or to otherwise establish the amount owed to it by the unit owner or otherwise to seek and obtain an order requiring the tenant in such unit, or tenants in other units owned by the unit owner in the condominium, to pay to the association rent otherwise due to the unit owner or otherwise limit the unit owner's association's rights at common law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In no event shall a unit owner take any retaliatory action against any tenant who pays rent, or any portion of rent, to the unit owners' association as provided in this section.  Any tenant so paying rent shall not be deemed in default on the rent to the extent of the payment to the association.  Any waiver of the provisions of this section in any lease or rental agreement shall be void and unenforceable as against public policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a vote of a majority of those attending an annual meeting of the unit owner's association, in person or by proxy, shall be necessary to adopt the provisions of this section as a part of the association's declaration or bylaws or both.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:47 Restraints on Alienation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the condominium instruments create any rights of first refusal or other restraints on free alienability of the condominium units, such rights and restraints shall be void unless the condominium instruments make provision for promptly furnishing to any unit owner or purchaser requesting the same a recordable statement certifying to any waiver of, or failure or refusal to exercise, such rights and restraints, in all cases where such waiver, failure, or refusal does in fact occur.  Failure or refusal to furnish promptly such a statement in such circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the condominium instruments shall make all such rights and restraints inapplicable to any disposition of a condominium unit in contemplation of which such statement was requested.  Any such statement shall be binding on the association of unit owners, the board of directors, and every unit owner.  Payment of a fee not exceeding $25 may be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of such a statement if the condominium instruments so provide.

Pursuant to the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005, Public Law 109-243, and notwithstanding any provision in the condominium instruments to the contrary, the unit owners' association shall not prohibit the outdoor display of the United States flag in a manner consistent with the United States flag code and RSA 3-E.  The association may adopt reasonable rules regarding the size of the flag and the manner in which the flag is displayed.  When a flag is flown from the unit owner's balcony or deck, from a bracket, the flag may extend over the vertical line of the unit owner's outboard deck line, which would put the flag into the common area, versus the unit owner's private space.

I. Upon receipt of an application for registration in proper form, the attorney general shall forthwith initiate an investigation to determine:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That the declarant can or can reasonably be expected to be able to convey or cause to be conveyed the interests in the units offered for disposition if the purchaser complies with the terms of the offer and when appropriate, the release clauses, conveyances in trust or other safeguards have been provided;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon receipt of the application for registration in proper form, the attorney general shall, within 10 business days, issue a notice of filing to the declarant.  Within 60 days from the date of the notice of filing, the attorney general shall enter an order registering the condominium or rejecting the registration.  If no order of rejection is entered within 60 days from the date of notice of filing, the condominium shall be deemed registered unless the declarant has consented in writing to a delay.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the attorney general affirmatively determines, upon inquiry and examination, that the requirements of this subdivision have been met, he shall enter an order registering the condominium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the attorney general determines upon inquiry and examination that any of the requirements of this subdivision have not been met, the attorney general shall notify the declarant that the application for registration must be corrected in the particulars specified within 15 days.  If the requirements are not met within the time allowed, the attorney general shall enter an order rejecting the registration, which shall include the findings of fact upon which the order is based.  During said 15 day period the declarant may petition for reconsideration and shall be entitled to a hearing within 15 days of receipt by the attorney general of said petition.  The attorney general shall enter his findings on said petition within 10 days of said hearing.  The attorney general shall not order a rejection of the registration until such time as the hearing, once requested, has taken place and the attorney general has entered his findings thereon, or such petition is withdrawn;  provided, however, that if by the time that said findings are entered, all of the particulars specified in the attorney general's notice have been corrected or, as a result of the attorney general's reconsideration and hearing, have been met to the attorney general's satisfaction, the attorney general shall order registration of the condominium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The declarant shall not make any material change in the plan of disposition or development of the condominium contained in an application for registration without notifying the attorney general, obtaining his prior approval and making appropriate amendment of the public offering statement.
<br>

(a) Any extension of a time limit set forth in a declaration and relating to RSA 356-B:16, III(c), RSA 356-B:16, IV(c), or RSA 356-B:23, III shall be effective upon the recordation of an amendment reflecting the agreement of owners of substantially completed units to which  2/3 of the votes in the unit owners' association appertain, or such larger majority as the condominium instruments may specify and if the existing rights to expand or contract the condominium or to exercise convertible land rights have expired, such an amendment shall also require a  4/5 vote of all unit owners of substantially completed units who are present or voting by proxy at a duly called and noticed meeting of the unit owners' association.  The amendment shall be deemed a material change requiring submission to the agency of both a copy of the amendment and a certification to include the following information:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The necessary vote that was obtained.
<br>

(5) The number of units that may be added to the condominium by reason of conversion or expansion.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The certification shall be filed on a specific form made available by the attorney general upon request.  Any amendment made pursuant to this section shall be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in any public offering statement that is required for the condominium.  A copy of such disclosure shall be submitted to the attorney general, but does not require his approval.  However, any defects or ambiguities noted therein by the attorney general and communicated to the submitting party shall be corrected prior to any further use or distribution of the statement.

If it appears that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any false, deceptive or misleading advertising to offer or dispose of any interest in a condominium unit, the attorney general may require by written notice the filing of advertising material relating to such condominium unit prior to its distribution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If it appears that a person has engaged or is about to engage in an act or practice constituting a violation of a provision of this chapter, or a rule or order hereunder, the attorney general, with or without prior administrative proceedings, may bring an action in the superior court to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order hereunder.  Upon proper showing, injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders shall be granted, and a receiver may be appointed pursuant to paragraph IV.  The attorney general is not required to post a bond in any court proceedings or prove that any other adequate remedy at law exists.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In connection with any action brought under paragraph III, the attorney general may also petition the court to appoint a receiver to take charge of the business of any person during the course of litigation when the attorney general has reason to believe that such an appointment is necessary to prevent such person from continuing to engage in any act or practice declared unlawful by this chapter and to preserve the assets of said person to restore to any other person any money or property acquired by any unlawful act or practice.  The receiver shall have the authority to sue for, collect, receive and take into his possession all the goods and chattels, rights and credits, moneys and effects, lands and tenements, books, records, documents, papers, choses in action, bills, notes and property of every description, including property with which such property has been mingled if it cannot be identified in kind because of such commingling, derived by means of any unlawful act or practice, and to sell, convey and assign the same and hold, dispose and distribute the proceeds thereof under the direction of the court.  Any person who has suffered damages as a result of the use of any unlawful act or practice, and submits proof to the satisfaction of the court that he has in fact been damaged, may participate with general creditors in the distribution of the assets to the extent that he has sustained out-of-pocket losses.  In the case of a partnership or business entity, the receiver shall settle the estate and distribute the assets under the direction of the court.  The court shall have jurisdiction of all questions arising in such proceedings and may make such orders and judgments therein as may be required.  In lieu of the foregoing procedure, the court may permit any person alleged to have violated this chapter to post a bond in a manner and in an amount to be fixed by the court.  Said bond shall be made payable to the state and may be distributed by the court only after a decision on the merits and the process of appeals has been exhausted.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The attorney general may intervene in any suit involving the declarant.  In any suit by or against a declarant involving a condominium, the declarant shall promptly furnish the attorney general notice of the suit and copies of all pleadings.

VI. The attorney general may:

II. For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this chapter, the attorney general or any officer designated by rule may administer oaths or affirmations and, upon his own motion or upon request of any party, shall subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any matter which is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge or relevant facts or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of material evidence.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The filing of the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the attorney general's decision.  The attorney general may grant, or the superior court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Within 30 days after the service of the petition, or within further time allowed by the court, the attorney general shall transmit to the superior court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review.  By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record may be shortened.

The attorney general may modify his findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the superior court.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 356-B:65 Civil Remedy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any declarant who disposes of any interest in a condominium unit in violation of this chapter, or who in disposing of any such interest makes an untrue statement of a material fact, or who in disposing of any such interest omits a material fact required to be stated in a registration statement or public offering statement or necessary to make the statements made not misleading, is liable to the purchaser of such interest, as set forth in paragraph II, unless in the case of an untruth or omission it is proved that the purchaser knew of the untruth or omission or that the declarant did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the untruth or omission, or that the purchaser did not rely on the untruth or omission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any purchaser, who is eligible for relief under paragraph I, may bring an action to restrain by temporary or permanent injunction any act or practice declared unlawful by this subdivision IV and may recover the consideration, including all finance charges paid in connection with the purchase of the condominium unit together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per year from the date of all such payments, less the amount of any income received from the condominium unit, upon tender of deed reconveying title to the declarant which is as good and marketable as that which was conveyed to the purchaser by the declarant.  In the discretion of the court, exemplary damages of up to $5,000 may also be awarded.  If the purchaser no longer owns the condominium unit, he may recover the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender of a reconveyance less the value of the condominium unit when disposed of and less interest at the rate of 6 percent per year on that amount from the date of disposition.  If the purchaser prevails in any such action, he may be awarded all reasonable costs and attorney's fees, as approved by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any person who materially participates in any disposition of any interest in a condominium unit in the manner specified in paragraph I and knew of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist shall also be liable jointly and severally with the declarant if and to the extent such liability may exist at common law or under other statutory provision.  A right to contribution exists among persons so liable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Every person whose occupation gives authority to a statement which with his consent has been used in an application for registration or public offering statement, if he is not otherwise associated with the condominium and development plan in a material way, is liable only for false statements knowingly made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. At any time before the entry of an action under this section, and thereafter only with the approval of the court, a declarant or any other person may limit his exposure herein by tendering a written offer to reimburse the injured person for all mandatory damages set forth in paragraph II, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, if any, to the date of such tender upon reconveyance of title as set forth in paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A person may not recover under this section in any action commenced more than 2 years from the date the purchaser knew or should have known of the existence of his cause of action, but in any case not more than 6 years after his first payment of money to the declarant in the contested transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Any stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring any interest in a condominium unit to waive compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under it is void.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The owner, publisher, licensee or operator of any newspaper, magazine, visual or sound radio broadcasting station or network of stations or the agents or employees of any such owner, publisher, licensee or operator of such newspaper, magazine, station or network of stations shall not be liable under this chapter for any advertising of any condominium or any interest in a condominium unit carried in any such newspaper or magazine or by any such visual or sound radio broadcasting station or network of stations nor shall any of them be liable under this chapter for the contents of any such advertisement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Any broker or real estate salesman violating any provision of this chapter may, in addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter, have his real estate broker's or salesman's license suspended or revoked by the real estate commission pursuant to RSA 331-A, for such time as in the circumstances it considers justified.
