&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. At any time the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that the declarant may be unable to complete the development of a condominium, or provide for its maintenance, if responsibility therefor is assumed by the declarant, as represented in its application for registration due to:

(a) Its failure to commence or complete the development of the condominium according to schedules set forth in the application;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Its commission of any false, deceptive or misleading acts in connection with the offering or disposing of any interest in any condominium or subdivided lands, as defined above;
<br>
he may require the declarant to post a bond in favor of the state or to provide evidence of financial security in such amount as the attorney general determines to be necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the commencement and completion of the development of the condominium.  Such bond shall not be accepted unless it is with a surety company authorized to do business in this state.  Any person aggrieved by the failure of the declarant to complete the condominium as represented in the application may proceed on such bond against the declarant or surety or both to recover damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Each application shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount equal to $30 per unit, except that the initial application fee shall be not less than $300 nor more than $2,000, and the fee for any application for registration of additional units shall be not less than $200 nor more than $2,000.
