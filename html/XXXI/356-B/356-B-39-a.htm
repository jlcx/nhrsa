<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) State the percent of votes necessary to approve each matter other than election of directors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Describe the time, date, and manner by which unit owners wishing to deliver information to all unit owners regarding the subject of the vote may do so.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Approval by ballot pursuant to this section is valid only if the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action.
