<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The bylaws shall provide the means by which the association shall elect a board of directors.  The bylaws shall specify the powers and responsibilities of the same and the number and terms of its members.  The bylaws may delegate to such board, among other things, any of the powers and responsibilities assigned by this chapter to the unit owners' association.  The bylaws shall also specify which, if any, of its powers and responsibilities the unit owners' association or its board may delegate to a managing agent.  The board of directors shall have a fiduciary relationship to members of the unit owners' association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The bylaws shall provide for election by the board of directors or, if the declaration requires, by the association members, of a president, treasurer, secretary, and any other officers of the association the bylaws specify.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The bylaws shall specify the qualifications, powers and duties, terms of office, and manner of electing and removing board members and officers and filling vacancies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. The bylaws may require an employee of a managing agent or condominium association to complete a background check prior to employment.  The cost of the background check shall be borne by the managing agent or the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The bylaws shall specify the officers who may prepare, execute, certify, and record amendments to the declaration on behalf of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The bylaws shall provide that the unit owners' association shall act on behalf of each unit owner in condemnation proceedings against the common areas of the condominium.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The bylaws shall contain any provision necessary to satisfy requirements of this chapter or the declaration concerning meetings, voting, quorums, and other activities of the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The bylaws shall provide for any matter required by laws of this state other than this chapter to appear in the bylaws of organizations of the same type as the association.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Subject to the declaration and this chapter, the bylaws may provide for any other necessary or appropriate matters, including matters that may be adopted as rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. In any case where an amendment to the declaration is required by RSA 356-B:18, II, III, or IV, the person or persons required to execute the same shall also prepare and execute, and record simultaneously with such amendment, an amendment to the bylaws.  The amendment to the bylaws shall allocate votes in the unit owners' association to new units on the same basis as was used for the allocation of such votes to the units depicted on site plans and floor plans recorded pursuant to RSA 356-B:20, I and II, or shall abolish the votes appertaining to former units, as the case may be.  The amendment to the bylaws shall also reallocate rights to future common profits, and liabilities for future common expenses not specially assessed, in proportion to relative voting strengths as reflected by the said amendment.
