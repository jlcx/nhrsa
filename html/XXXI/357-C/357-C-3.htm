<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(e) Whether and to what extent the manufacturer's original warranty applies to the vehicle;  and,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Order or accept delivery of any motor vehicle or vehicles, appliances, equipment, parts or accessories therefor, or any other commodity not required by law, which such motor vehicle dealer has not voluntarily ordered, or order or accept delivery of any motor vehicle with special features, appliances, accessories or equipment not included in the list price of such motor vehicles as publicly advertised by their manufacturer;  except that this subparagraph shall not modify or supersede any terms or provisions of a franchise requiring new motor vehicle dealers to market a representative line of those motor vehicles which the manufacturer or distributor is publicly advertising;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Order for any person any parts, accessories, equipment, machinery, tools, appliances, or any commodity whatsoever;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Pay or assume, directly or indirectly, any part of the cost of any refund, rebate, discount, or other financial adjustment made by or lawfully imposed upon the manufacturer or distributor to, or in favor of, any customer of a motor vehicle dealer or other consumer, unless voluntarily agreed to by such dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Manufacturer;  distributor;  distributor branch or division;  factory branch or division;  or any agent thereof to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities, and within a reasonable time after receipt of dealer's order, to any motor vehicle dealer having a franchise or contractual arrangement for the retail sale of new motor vehicles sold or distributed by such manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or division, or factory branch or division, any motor vehicles covered by such franchise or contract and specifically advertised by such manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or division, or factory branch or division to be available for immediate delivery;  provided, however, that the failure to deliver any motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this subparagraph if such failure is due to an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to strike or labor difficulty, shortage of materials, the seasonal nature of the production and ordering of the new motor vehicles, freight embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer, distributor, or any agent thereof, shall have no control;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Coerce, or attempt to coerce, any motor vehicle dealer to enter into any agreement with such manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or any agent thereof, or do any other act prejudicial to the dealer by threatening to cancel any franchise or any contractual agreement existing between such manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or division, or factory branch or division, and the dealer provided, however, that notice in good faith to any motor vehicle dealer of that dealer's violation of any terms or provisions of such franchise or contractual agreement shall not constitute a violation of this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the franchise or selling agreement of any such dealer without good cause;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with his business as manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or agent thereof;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Offer to sell or to sell any new motor vehicle at a lower actual price than the actual price offered to any other motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle similarly equipped or utilize any device including, but not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs which result in a lesser actual price.  However, the provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle dealer for resale to any unit of government;  to sales made directly to a unit of government;  nor to sales to a motor vehicle dealer of any motor vehicle ultimately sold, donated or used by such dealer in a driver education program.  The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply so long as a manufacturer, distributor, or any agent thereof, offers to sell or sells new motor vehicles to all motor vehicle dealers at an equal price;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Offer, sell, or lease any new motor vehicle to any person, except a distributor, at a lower actual price than the actual price offered and charged a motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle similarly equipped or utilize any device which results in such lesser actual price;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Offer or sell parts or accessories to any new motor vehicle dealer for use in his own business for the purpose of replacing or repairing the same or comparable part or accessory at a lower actual price than the actual price charged to any other new motor vehicle dealer for similar parts or accessories for use in his own business;  provided, however, that, where motor vehicle dealers operate as distributors of parts and accessories to retail outlets, nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to prevent a manufacturer, distributor, or any agent thereof, from selling to a motor vehicle dealer who operates as a distributor of parts and accessories such parts and accessories as may be ordered by such motor vehicle dealer for resale to retail outlets at a lower price than the actual price charged a motor vehicle dealer who does not operate or serve as a distributor of parts and accessories;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Prevent or attempt to prevent any motor vehicle dealer from changing the capital structure of his dealership or the means by which he finances the operation of his dealership, provided the dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the dealership and the manufacturer or distributor and that such change by the dealer does not result in a change in the executive management control of the dealership;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Prevent or attempt to prevent any motor vehicle dealer or any officer, partner or stockholder of any motor vehicle dealer from transferring any part of the interest of any of them to any other person;  provided, however, that no dealer, officer, partner or stockholder shall have the right to sell, transfer or assign the franchise or power of management or control without the consent of the manufacturer or distributor unless such consent is unreasonably withheld.  Failure to respond within 60 days of receipt of a written request for consent to a sale, transfer or assignment shall be deemed consent to the request;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Obtain any benefit from any other person with whom the motor vehicle dealer does business on account of or in relation to the transactions between the dealer and such other person, unless such benefit is promptly accounted for and transmitted to the motor vehicle dealer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Compete with a motor vehicle dealer operating under an agreement or franchise from such manufacturer or distributor in the relevant market area;  provided, however:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If any manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or division, or factory branch or division, either directly or indirectly, or through any subsidiary, affiliated entity, or person, owns, operates, or controls, in full or in part, a motor vehicle dealership in this state for the sale or service of motor vehicles in this state, the relevant market area shall be the area within the entire state of New Hampshire and, except for circumstances in which subparagraph (3) may apply, the New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board shall find good cause under RSA 357-C:9 before any such ownership, operation, or control shall be permitted.  In addition to those factors listed in RSA 357-C:9, II, the board in such circumstances shall also consider in its determination of good cause whether the proposed dealership will create an unfair method of competition to other franchisees of the same manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, subsidiary, or affiliated entity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) That a manufacturer or distributor shall not be deemed to be competing when operating a dealership either temporarily, for a reasonable period in any case not to exceed 2 years;  provided that if a manufacturer or distributor shows good cause, the board may extend this time limit and extensions may be granted by the board for periods of up to 12 months;  or unless the manufacturer or dealer through a bona fide relationship in which an independent person has made a significant investment subject to loss in the dealership and can reasonably expect to acquire full ownership of such dealership on reasonable terms and conditions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A manufacturer that has no more than 5 franchised new motor vehicle dealers doing business in this state and that directly or indirectly owns one or more of them shall not be deemed to be competing with any unaffiliated new motor vehicle dealer trading in the manufacturer's line make at a distance of 18 miles or greater provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) All the new motor vehicle dealerships selling such manufacturer's motor vehicles trade exclusively in the manufacturer's line make;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) As of March 1, 2000, the manufacturer shall have directly or indirectly owned one or more new motor vehicle dealers in this state for a continuous period of at least one year;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Neither the manufacturer nor any entity in which the manufacturer has a majority ownership interest shall acquire, operate, or control any dealership that the manufacturer did not directly or indirectly own as of March 1, 2000;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A manufacturer or distributor that sells and services motor vehicles in New Hampshire and is licensed as a dealer in New Hampshire shall not be deemed to be competing with any dealer if no dealer or other franchisee sells and services the same line make in New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) Grant a competitive franchise in the relevant market area previously granted to another franchise other than in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(m) Require a motor vehicle dealer to assent to a release assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) Impose unreasonable restrictions on the motor vehicle dealer or franchisee relative to transfer, sale, right to renew, termination, discipline, noncompetition covenants, site-contract, right of first refusal to purchase, option to purchase, compliance with subjective standards, or assertion of legal or equitable rights;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(o) Change the relevant market area set forth in the franchise agreement without good cause.  For purposes of the subparagraph, good cause shall include, but not be limited to, changes in the dealer's registration pattern, demographics, customer convenience, and geographic barriers.  At least 60 days prior to the effective date of the revised relevant market area, the manufacturer or distributor shall provide the dealer whose relevant market area is subject to the proposed change, a reasonable and commercially acceptable copy of all information, data, evaluations, and methodology that the manufacturer or distributor considered, reviewed, or relied on or based its decision on, to propose the change to the dealer's relevant market area;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(p) Require a motor vehicle franchisee to agree to a term or condition in a franchise, or in any lease related to the operation of the franchise or agreement ancillary or collateral to a franchise, as a condition to the offer, grant, or renewal of the franchise, lease, or agreement, which:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Requires the motor vehicle franchisee to waive trial by jury in actions involving the motor vehicle franchisor;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Specifies the jurisdictions, venues, or tribunals in which disputes arising with respect to the franchise, lease, or agreement shall or shall not be submitted for resolution or otherwise prohibits a motor vehicle franchisee from bringing an action in a particular forum otherwise available under the law of this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Requires that disputes between the motor vehicle franchisor and motor vehicle franchisee be submitted to arbitration or to any other binding alternate dispute resolution procedure;  provided, however, that any franchise, lease, or agreement may authorize the submission of a dispute to arbitration or to binding alternate dispute resolution if the motor vehicle franchisor and motor vehicle franchisee voluntarily agree to submit the dispute to arbitration or binding alternate dispute resolution at the time the dispute arises;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Provides that in any administrative or judicial proceeding arising from any dispute with respect to the aforesaid agreements that the franchisor shall be entitled to recover its costs, reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation from the franchisee;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Grants the manufacturer an option to purchase the franchise, or real estate, or business assets of the franchisee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(q) Fail or refuse to sell or offer to sell to all motor vehicle franchisees of a line make, all models manufactured for that line make, or requiring a dealer to pay any extra fee, execute a separate franchise agreement, purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other materials, or relocate, expand, improve, remodel, renovate, recondition, or alter the dealer's existing facilities, or provide exclusive facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or series of vehicles.  However, a manufacturer may require reasonable improvements to the existing facility that are necessary to service special or unique features of a specific model or line.  The failure to deliver any such motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this subparagraph if the failure is due to a lack of manufacturing capacity, a strike or labor difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight embargo, or other cause over which the franchisor has no control;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(r) Provide any term or condition in any lease or other agreement ancillary or collateral to a franchise which term or condition directly or indirectly violates this title;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(s) In the event of a proposed sale or transfer of a new motor vehicle dealership involving the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the ownership interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of the dealership, where the franchise agreement for the dealership contains a right of first refusal in favor of the manufacturer or distributor, then notwithstanding the terms of the franchise agreement, the manufacturer or distributor shall be permitted to exercise a right of first refusal to acquire the dealership's assets only if all of the following requirements are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The manufacturer or distributor notifies the dealer in writing of its intent to exercise its right of first refusal within 45 days of receiving notice from the franchisee of the proposed sale or transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The exercise of the right of first refusal will result in the dealer and dealer's owners receiving the same or greater consideration as they have contracted to receive in connection with the proposed change of all or substantially all ownership or transfer of all or substantially all dealership assets.  In that regard, the following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The manufacturer or distributor shall have the right to and shall assume the dealer's lease for, or acquire the real property on which the franchise is conducted, on the same terms as those on which the real property or lease was to be sold or transferred to the proposed new owner in connection with the sale of the franchise, unless otherwise agreed to by the dealer and manufacturer or distributor.  The manufacturer or distributor shall have the right to assign the lease or to convey the real property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The manufacturer or distributor shall assume all of the duties, obligations, and liabilities contained in the agreements that were to be assumed by the proposed new owner and with respect to which the manufacturer or distributor exercised the right of first refusal, including the duty to honor all time deadlines in the underlying agreements, provided that the manufacturer or distributor has knowledge of such obligations at the time of the exercise of the right of first refusal.  Failure by an assignee of the manufacturer or distributor to discharge such obligations shall be deemed a failure by the manufacturer or distributor under this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The proposed change of all or substantially all ownership or transfer of all or substantially all dealership assets does not involve the transfer of assets or the transfer or issuance of stock by the dealer or one or more dealer owners to any of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) A child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(B) A manager:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(ii) Who is otherwise qualified as a dealer operator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) A partnership or corporation controlled by any of the family members described in subparagraph (A).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(D) A trust arrangement established or to be established:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) For the purpose of allowing the new vehicle dealer to continue to qualify as such under the manufacturer's or distributor's standards;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) To provide for the succession of the franchise agreement to designated family members or qualified management in the event of the death or incapacity of the dealer or its principal owner or owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The manufacturer or distributor agrees in writing to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney fees which do not exceed the usual, customary, and reasonable fees charged for similar work done for other clients, incurred by the proposed new owner and transferee prior to the manufacturer's or distributor's exercise of its right of first refusal in negotiating and implementing the contract for the proposed change of all or substantially all ownership or transfer of all or substantially all dealership assets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment of such expenses and attorney fees shall be required if the dealer has not submitted or caused to be submitted an accounting of those expenses within 30 days of the dealer's receipt of the manufacturer's or distributor's written request for such an accounting.  Such an accounting may be requested by a manufacturer or distributor before exercising its right of first refusal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The manufacturer or distributor shall pay any fees and expenses of the motor vehicle dealer arising on and after the date the manufacturer or distributor gives notice of the exercise of its right of first refusal, and incurred by the motor vehicle dealer as a result of alterations to documents, or additional appraisals, valuations, or financial analyses caused or required of the dealer by the manufacturer or distributor to consummate the contract for the sale of the dealership to the manufacturer's or distributor's proposed transferee, that would not have been incurred but for the manufacturer's or distributor's exercise of its right of first refusal.  These expenses and fees shall be paid by the manufacturer or distributor to the dealer and to the dealer's proposed purchaser or transferee on or before the closing date of the sale of the dealership to the manufacturer or distributor if the party entitled to reimbursement has submitted or caused to be submitted to the manufacturer or distributor, an accounting of these expenses and fees within 30 days after receipt of the manufacturer's or distributor's written request for the accounting;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(t) Require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer to purchase or order any new motor vehicle as a precondition to purchasing, ordering, or receiving any other new motor vehicle or vehicles.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent a manufacturer from requiring that a new motor vehicle dealer fairly represent and inventory the full line of new motor vehicles that are covered by the franchise agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(u)(1) Allocate vehicles, to evaluate the performance of a motor vehicle franchise, or to offer to a dealer any discount, incentive, bonus, program, allowance or credit (collectively "incentives''), using sales effective measurements that the manufacturer knows or reasonably should know includes exported vehicles, after being provided with notice and the opportunity to conduct an investigation as provided in subparagraph (u)(3).  "Sales effective measurement'' means a system that measures how effective a franchisee is at selling vehicles by comparing vehicle sales by that franchisee in the territory or geographic region assigned to the franchisee to vehicles sold in the same territory by other franchisees, or other similar methods of measurement.  For the purposes of this section, "exported vehicles''  are new vehicles that:  (i) are titled in New Hampshire but not registered in New Hampshire or any other state;  (ii) are titled and registered in New Hampshire but not issued a valid New Hampshire state inspection sticker;  or (iii) are exported out of the country within 6 months of purchase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If a manufacturer uses sales effective measurements to allocate vehicles, evaluate a franchisee, or determine incentives, the manufacturer, upon the written request of one of its franchisees, shall, within 30 days, provide the vehicle identification numbers that the manufacturer possessed and used in the measurements during the time period requested by the dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If a manufacturer uses sales effective measurements to allocate vehicles, evaluate a franchisee, or determine incentives, a dealer may request that the manufacturer or distributor investigate a claim that exported vehicles are included in the measurements.  To initiate the investigation, the dealer shall provide reasonable documentation that 8 or more exported vehicles were used in the measurements.  Acceptable documentation shall include, but not be limited to, data from the division of motor vehicles and vehicle history reports from third party vendors.  Within 30 days of the dealer's request, the manufacturer shall investigate the claim and adjust those measurements proportionately to exclude any exported vehicles and adjust the allocation, evaluation, and incentives.  As part of the investigation, the manufacturer shall provide the dealer with any and all information, data, evaluations, methodology or other items, that the manufacturer or distributor considered, reviewed, or relied on, for the measurement.  The manufacturer shall have the burden to prove that it has acted in accordance with the requirements of this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(v) Require adherence to a performance standard or standards which are not applied uniformly to other similarly situated dealers.  In addition to any other requirements of law, the following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A performance standard, sales objective, or program for measuring dealer performance that may have a material effect on a dealer, including the dealer's right to payment under any incentive or reimbursement program, and the application of the standard, sales objective or program by a manufacturer, distributor or factory branch, shall be fair, reasonable, equitable and based on accurate information.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Prior to beginning any incentive or reimbursement program, the manufacturer shall provide in writing to each dealer of the same line-make that chooses to participate in the program the dealer's performance requirement or sales goal or objective, which shall include a detailed explanation of the methodology, criteria, and calculations used.  The manufacturer shall provide each dealer with the performance requirement or sales goal or objective of all dealers participating in the program whose relevant market area includes territory within this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A manufacturer shall allocate an adequate supply of vehicles, appropriate to the market, to its dealers by series, product line, and model to assist the dealer in achieving any performance standards established by the manufacturer and distributor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) A dealer that claims that the application of a performance standard, sales objective, or program for measuring dealership performance does not meet the standards listed in subparagraph (1) may request a hearing before the motor vehicle industry board pursuant to RSA 357-C:12.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the performance standard, sales objective, or program for measuring dealership performance complies with this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(w)(1) Require a dealer to purchase goods or services from a vendor selected, identified, or designated by a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or one of its affiliates by agreement, program, incentive provision, or otherwise without making available to the dealer the option to obtain the goods or services of substantially similar quality and overall design from a vendor chosen by the dealer and approved by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch;  provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and further provided that the dealer's option to select a vendor shall not be available if the manufacturer or distributor provides substantial reimbursement for the goods or services offered.  Substantial reimbursement is equal to or greater than 65 percent of the cost, which shall not be greater than the cost of reasonably available similar goods and services in close proximity to the dealer's market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Fail to provide to a dealer, if the goods and services to be supplied to the dealer by a vendor selected, identified, or designated by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch are signs or other franchisor image or design elements or trade dress to be leased to the dealer, the right to purchase the signs or other franchisor image or design elements or trade dress of substantially similar quality from a vendor selected by the dealer;  provided that the signs, images, design elements, or trade dress are approved by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch and that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  This section shall not be construed to allow a dealer to impair or eliminate the intellectual property rights of the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, nor to permit a dealer to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the intellectual property usage guidelines of the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(x) Make any express or implied statement or representation directly or indirectly that the dealer is under any obligation whatsoever to offer to sell or sell any extended service contract or extended maintenance plan, gap policy, gap waiver, or other aftermarket product or service offered, sold, backed by, or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor or to sell, assign, or transfer any of the dealer's retail sales contracts or leases in this state on motor vehicles manufactured or sold by the manufacturer or distributor to a finance company or class of finance companies, leasing company or class of leasing companies, or other specified person, because of any relationship or affiliation between the manufacturer or distributor and the finance company or companies, leasing company or leasing companies, or the specified person or persons.  Provided, however, that nothing in this subparagraph prohibits a manufacturer from requiring that a dealer disclose to a customer when the customer is about to purchase a product covered by this subparagraph that is not offered, sold, backed by, or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(y) Directly or indirectly condition the awarding of a franchise to a prospective franchisee, the addition of a line-make or franchise to an existing franchisee, the renewal of a franchise of an existing franchisee, the approval of the relocation of an existing franchisee's facility, or the approval of the sale or transfer of the ownership of a franchise on the willingness of a franchisee, proposed franchisee, or owner of an interest in the dealership facility to enter into a site control agreement or exclusive use agreement.  For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "site control agreement'' and "exclusive use agreement'' include any agreement that has the effect of either requiring that the franchisee establish or maintain exclusive dealership facilities or restricting the ability of the franchisee, or the ability of the franchisee's lessor in the event the dealership facility is being leased, to transfer, sell, lease, or change the use of the dealership premises, whether by sublease, lease, collateral pledge of lease, option to purchase, option to lease, or other similar agreement, regardless of the parties to such agreement.  Any provision contained in any agreement that is inconsistent with the provisions of this subparagraph shall be voidable at the election of the affected franchisee, prospective franchisee, or owner of an interest in the dealership facility, provided this subparagraph shall not apply to a voluntary agreement where separate and valuable consideration has been offered and accepted, provided that the renewal of a franchise agreement or the manufacturer's waiver of a contractual or statutory right shall not by itself constitute separate and valuable consideration.  Except as provided in this subparagraph, this chapter shall not apply to prospective franchisees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(z) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any agreement or franchise, require any motor vehicle dealer to floor plan any of the dealer's inventory or finance the acquisition, construction, or renovation of any of the dealer's property or facilities by or through any financial source or sources designated by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, including any financial source or sources that is or are directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. It shall be deemed a violation for a motor vehicle dealer to require a purchaser of a new motor vehicle, as a condition of sale and delivery, to also purchase special features, appliances, equipment, parts or accessories not desired or requested by the purchaser;  provided, however, that this paragraph shall not apply to special features, appliances, equipment, parts or accessories which are already installed on the car when received by the dealer and;  provided further, that the motor vehicle dealer, prior to the consummation of the purchase, reveals to the purchaser the substance of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise agreement or sales and service agreement or any other agreement, to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer by program, policy, standard, or otherwise to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Change location of the dealership;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Construct, renovate, or make any substantial changes, alterations, or remodeling to a motor vehicle dealer's sales or service facilities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Add to or replace a motor vehicle dealer's sales or service facilities;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Add to or replace or relocate purchased or leased signage or prohibit a dealer from substituting a sign owned by a dealer pursuant to RSA 357-C:3, III(w).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The prohibitions in subparagraph (a) shall not apply if the manufacturer's or distributor's requirements are reasonable and justifiable in light of the current and reasonably foreseeable economic conditions, financial expectations, availability of additional vehicle allocation, and motor vehicle dealer's market for the sale and service of vehicles, or the alteration is reasonably required to effectively display and service a vehicle based on the technology of the vehicle.  The manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of proving that changes, alterations, remodeling, or replacement to a motor vehicle dealer's sales or service facilities or signage are reasonable and justifiable under this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any cost to obtain a variance or other approval from any governmental body in order to proceed under subparagraph (a) shall be paid by the dealer in the first instance.  When subsequent efforts are required to obtain the variance or other approval, including any appeals, the manufacturer or distributor that is seeking the action listed in subparagraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) shall pay, provided that such subsequent efforts were not required because of clerical error or negligent action or inaction on the part of the dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Except as necessary to comply with health or safety laws or to comply with technology requirements necessary to sell or service a vehicle, it is unreasonable and not justifiable for a manufacturer or distributor to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer by program, policy, facility guide, standard or otherwise to change the location of the dealership or construct, replace, renovate or make any substantial changes, alterations, or remodeling to a motor vehicle dealer's sales or service facilities before the 15th anniversary of the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or the manufacturer's approval, whichever is later, from:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The date construction of the dealership at that location was completed if the construction was in substantial compliance with standards or plans provided by a manufacturer, distributor, or representative or through a subsidiary or agent of the manufacturer, distributor, or representative;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The date a prior change, alteration, or remodel of the dealership at that location was completed if the construction was in substantial compliance with standards or plans provided by a manufacturer, distributor, or representative or through a subsidiary or agent of the manufacturer, distributor, or representative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Notwithstanding the 15-year limitation on manufacturer-mandated changes in subparagraph (d), the limitation shall not be effective if the manufacturer or distributor offers substantial reimbursement for the requested changes, alterations, or remodeling of a dealer's sales or service facilities.  Substantial reimbursement is equal to or greater than 65 percent of the cost, which shall not be greater than the cost of reasonably available similar goods and services in close proximity to the dealer's market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) This paragraph shall not apply to a program that is in effect with one or more motor vehicle dealers in this state on the effective date of this subparagraph, nor to any renewal or modification of such a program.
