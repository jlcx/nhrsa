&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 357-C:5 Warranty Obligations, Transportation Damage and Indemnification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division thereof shall fulfill the terms of any express or implied warranty it makes concerning the sale of a new motor vehicle to the public or ultimate purchaser of the line make which is the subject of a contract or franchise agreement.  If it is determined by the court in an action at law that the manufacturer has violated its express or implied warranty, the court shall add to any award or relief granted an additional award for reasonable attorney's fees and other necessary expenses for maintaining the litigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any franchisor shall require or permit franchisees to perform services or provide parts in satisfaction of a warranty issued by the franchisor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The franchisor shall specify in writing to each of its new motor vehicle dealers licensed in this state, the dealers' obligations for warranty service on its products, shall compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for warranty service required of the dealer by the manufacturer, and shall provide the dealer the schedule of compensation to be paid such dealer for parts, work and service in connection with warranty services, and the time allowance for the performance of such work and service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) In no event shall a schedule of compensation for parts, work, and service in connection with warranty services fail to include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service and labor.  Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service shall be reasonable and adequate for the work to be performed.  In no event shall any manufacturer, component manufacturer, or distributor pay its dealers an amount of money for warranty work that is less than that charged by the dealer to the retail customers of the dealer for non-warranty work of like kind.  No claim which has been approved and paid by the manufacturer or distributor may be charged back to the dealer unless it can be shown that the claim was false or fraudulent, that the repairs were not properly made or were unnecessary to correct the defective condition, or that the dealer failed to reasonably substantiate that the claim was in accordance with the written requirements of the manufacturer or distributor in effect at the time the claim arose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In no event shall a manufacturer or component manufacturer fail to pay a dealer reasonable compensation for parts or components, including assemblies, used in warranty or recall repairs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The wholesale price on which a dealer's markup reimbursement is based for any parts used in a recall, service campaign, or other similar program, shall not be less than the highest wholesale price listed in the manufacturer's or distributor's wholesale price catalogue within 6 months prior to the start of the recall, service campaign, or other similar program.  If the manufacturer or distributor does not have a wholesale price catalogue, or if the part is not listed in a wholesale price catalogue, the wholesale price on which a dealer's markup reimbursement is based in a recall, service campaign, or other similar program shall be the average price charged to dealers of similar line makes in the state for the part during 6 months prior to the start of the recall, service campaign, or other similar program.  In no event shall a dealer receive less than the dealer's actual cost for that part, plus the markup as calculated pursuant to this subparagraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No new motor vehicle manufacturer shall fail to perform any warranty obligations, including tires, whether or not such tires placed on the new motor vehicle by the manufacturer are excluded under the motor vehicle manufacturer's warranty;  fail to include in written notices of factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and dealers the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to dealers for the correction of such defects;  or fail to compensate any of the new motor vehicle dealers in this state for repairs effected by such recall.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) All claims made by new motor vehicle dealers pursuant to this section for labor and parts shall be paid within 30 days following their approval.  All such claims shall be either approved and paid or disapproved within 30 days after their receipt, and any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within such period shall be deemed approved.  Notice of rejection of any claim shall be accompanied by a specific statement of the grounds on which the rejection is based.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division shall retain the right to audit warranty claims for a period of one year after the date on which the claim is paid and charge back any amounts paid on claims that are false or unsubstantiated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) A manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division shall retain the right to audit all incentive and reimbursement programs for a period of one year after the date on which the claim is paid or one year from the end of a program that does not exceed one year, whichever is later, and charge back any amounts paid on claims that are false or unsubstantiated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Any new motor vehicle dealer who is audited by a manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division shall have the right to be present or represented by counsel or other designated representative.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Any chargeback resulting from any audit shall not be made until a final order is issued by the New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board if a protest to the proposed chargeback is filed within 30 days of the notification of the final amount claimed by the manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division to be due after exhausting any procedure established by the manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division to contest the chargeback, other than arbitration.  If the chargeback is affirmed by a final order of the board, the dealer shall be liable for interest on the amount set forth in the order at a rate of the prime rate effective on the date of the order plus one percent per annum from the date of the filing of the protest.  In the absence of fraud, the board may order, based on the equities and circumstances of the parties, that the chargeback plus applicable interest be paid in installments not exceeding 12 months.  If the board finds that a warranty chargeback is the result of a fraudulent warranty claim, no installment payments shall be allowed by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) A manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division shall retain the right to charge back a fraudulent warranty claim, subject to any limitation period established in the franchise agreement but in no event longer than the limitation period provided in RSA 508:4, I.  The applicable limitation period shall commence on the date a fraudulent warranty claim is paid.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(7) If the franchise agreement between a manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division is terminated for any reason, any audit pursuant to this section shall be completed no later than 30 days after the effective date of the termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(8) Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise or agreement, a manufacturer, distributor, branch, or division shall not take or threaten to take any adverse action against a motor vehicle dealer, including charge backs, reducing vehicle allocations, or terminating or threatening to terminate a franchise or agreement because the dealer sold or leased a motor vehicle to a customer who exported the vehicle to a foreign country, unless the motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have known that the customer intended to export the vehicle.  There shall be a presumption that the motor vehicle dealer did not know or could not have reasonably known if the vehicle is titled or registered in any state in this country.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The franchisor shall not in any way restrict the nature or extent of services to be rendered or parts to be provided so that such restriction prevents the franchisee from satisfying a warranty in a workmanlike manner with all required or necessary parts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any agreement or franchise, a new motor vehicle dealer shall be solely liable for damages to new motor vehicles after acceptance from the carrier and before delivery to the ultimate purchaser.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any agreement or franchise, a manufacturer shall be liable for all damages to motor vehicles before delivery to a carrier or transporter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A new motor vehicle dealer shall be liable for damages to new motor vehicles after delivery to the carrier only if the dealer selects the method of transportation, mode of transportation, and the carrier;  in all other instances, the manufacturer shall be liable for carrier-related new motor vehicle damage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) On any new motor vehicle, any uncorrected damage or any corrected damage exceeding 6 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail price, as defined in 15 U.S.C.A. sections 1231-33, as measured by retail repair costs, shall be disclosed in writing by the manufacturer or distributor to the dealer and shall be disclosed in writing by the dealer to the ultimate purchaser prior to delivery.  Damage to glass, tires, and bumpers shall be excluded from the calculation required in this subparagraph when replaced by identical manufacturer's original equipment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Repaired damage to a customer-ordered new motor vehicle less than the amount requiring disclosure in subparagraph (d) shall not constitute grounds for revocation of the customer order.  The customer's right of revocation shall cease upon his acceptance of delivery of the vehicle, provided disclosure is made prior to delivery.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If damage to a vehicle exceeds the amount requiring disclosure in subparagraph (d) at either the time the new motor vehicle is accepted by the new motor vehicle dealer, or whenever the risk of loss is shifted to the dealer, whichever occurs first, then the dealer may reject the vehicle within a reasonable time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) If a new motor vehicle dealer determines the method of transportation, as defined in subparagraph (c), then the risk of loss during transit shall pass to the dealer upon delivery of the vehicle to the carrier.  In every other instance, the risk of loss shall remain with the manufacturer until such time as the new motor vehicle dealer accepts the vehicle from the carrier.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) A franchisor shall indemnify its franchisees from any and all reasonable claims, losses, damages, and costs, including attorney's fees resulting from or related to complaints, claims or suits against the franchisee by third parties, including but not limited to those based upon strict liability, negligence, misrepresentation, warranty and revocation of acceptance or rescission, where an action alleges fault due to:  (1) the manufacture, assembly, or design of the vehicle, parts, or accessories, or the selection or combination of parts or components;  (2) service systems, procedures or methods required, recommended or suggested to the franchisee by the franchisor;  or (3) damage to the vehicle in transit to the franchisee where the carrier is designated by the manufacturer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The franchisor shall not be liable to the franchisee by virtue of this section for any claims, losses, costs or damages arising as a result of negligence or willful malfeasance by the franchisee in its performance of delivery, preparation, or warranty obligations required by the franchisor, or other services performed;  provided, however, that the franchisor shall be liable for damages arising from or in connection with any services rendered by a franchisee in accordance with any service, system, procedure or method suggested or required by the franchisor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In any action where there are both allegations for which the franchisor is required to indemnify the franchisee and claims of negligence in the performance of services by the franchisee, the percentage of fault of each shall be determined and the franchisor's duty to indemnify the franchisee against all damages and expenses, including attorney's fees, shall be limited to that percentage of fault found to be of the type set forth in subparagraph (a).
