&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 357-C:9 Limitations on Establishing or Relocating Dealerships. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the event that a manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division thereof seeks to enter into a franchise establishing an additional new motor vehicle dealership or relocating an existing new motor vehicle dealership within a relevant market area where the same line make is then represented, the manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division thereof shall first give written notice to the New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board and each new motor vehicle dealer of such line make in the relevant market area of the intention to establish an additional dealership or to relocate an existing dealership within that market area.  Within 45 days of receiving such notice or within 45 days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division thereof, any such new motor vehicle dealership may file a protest with the New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board to the establishing or relocating of the new motor vehicle dealership.  A copy shall be served on the manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division thereof within the 45-day period.  When such protest is filed, the manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division thereof may not establish or relocate the proposed new motor vehicle dealership until the board has held a hearing, nor thereafter if the board determines that there is good cause for not permitting such new motor vehicle dealership.  For purposes of this paragraph, the reopening in a relevant market area of a new motor vehicle dealership that has not been in operation for one year or more shall be deemed the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining whether good cause has been established for not entering into or relocating an additional franchise for the same line make, the board shall consider the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The permanency of the investment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any effect on the retail new motor vehicle business and the consuming public in the relevant market area;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public welfare for an additional new motor vehicle dealership to be established;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Whether the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in that relevant market area are providing adequate competition and convenient consumer care for the motor vehicles of the line make in the market area which shall include the adequacy of motor vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of motor vehicle parts, and qualified service personnel;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Whether the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealership would increase competition, and therefore be in the public interest;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Growth or decline in population and new car registration in the relevant market area.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. At any hearing conducted by the New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board under this section, the manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division thereof seeking to establish an additional new motor vehicle dealership or relocate an existing new motor vehicle dealership shall have the burden of proof in establishing that good cause exists and that it acted in good faith.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In the event that a manufacturer, distributor, or branch or division is seeking to establish a new dealership rather than relocating an existing dealership, in addition to the definition of market area in RSA 357-C:1, XXI, in no case shall a franchisee's relevant market area be less than the area within a radius of 15 miles from any boundary of the dealership.
