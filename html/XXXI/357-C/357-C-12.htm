<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) There is established a New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter.  The board shall consist of the commissioner of the department of safety or designee who shall serve as the board's chairperson and 6 members appointed by the governor and council.  Four members of the board shall constitute a quorum.  No member of the board shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Have an ownership interest in or be employed by a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Have an ownership interest in or be a motor vehicle dealer or an employee of a motor vehicle dealer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Be employed by an association of motor vehicle dealers, manufacturers, or distributors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board shall be administratively attached to the department of safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The board shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, to implement the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Appointments shall be for terms of 4 years.  Vacancies shall be filled by appointment by the governor and council for the unexpired term.  The members shall be at-large members, and insofar as practical, should reflect fair and equitable statewide representation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Appointed members of the board may be paid a $50 per diem for each day actually engaged in the performance of their duties and may be reimbursed their actual and necessary expenses incurred in carrying out their duties as may be authorized by the governor and council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except for civil actions filed in superior court pursuant to paragraph IX of this section, the board shall have the following exclusive powers:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any person may file a written protest with the board complaining of conduct governed by and violative of this chapter.  The board shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the rules adopted by the board pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board shall issue written decisions and may issue orders to any person in violation of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The parties to protests filed pursuant to RSA 357-C:7, RSA 357-C:8, and RSA 357-C:9 shall be permitted to conduct and use the same discovery procedures as are provided in civil actions in the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board shall be empowered to determine the location of hearings, appoint persons to serve at the deposition of out-of-state witnesses, administer oaths, and authorize stenographic or recorded transcripts of proceedings before it.  Prior to the hearing on any protest, but no later than 45 days after the filing of the protest, the board shall require the parties to the proceeding to attend a prehearing conference where the chairperson or designee shall have the parties address the possibility of settlement.  If the matter is not resolved through the conference, the matter shall be placed on the board's calendar for hearings.  Conference discussions shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed or used as an admission in any subsequent hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Compliance with the discovery procedures authorized by paragraph III may be enforced by application to the board.  Obedience to subpoenas issued to compel witnesses or documents may be enforced by application to the superior court in the county where the hearing is to take place.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any party to any proceeding under this chapter who recklessly or knowingly fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with an order issued by the board shall be fined a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000.  Each day of noncompliance shall be considered a separate violation of such order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Within 20 days after any order or decision of the board, any party to the proceeding may apply for a rehearing with respect to any matter determined in the proceeding, or covered or included in the order or decision.  The application for rehearing shall set forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision or order complained of is unlawful or unreasonable.  No appeal from any order or decision of the board shall be taken unless the appellant makes an application for rehearing as provided in this paragraph, and when such application for rehearing has been made, no ground not set forth in the application shall be urged, relied on, or given any consideration by a court unless the court for good cause shown allows the appellant to specify additional grounds.  Any party to the proceeding may appeal the final order, including all interlocutory orders or decisions, to the superior court within 30 days after the date the board rules on the application for reconsideration of the final order or decision.  All findings of the board upon all questions of fact properly before the court shall be prima facie lawful and reasonable.  The order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law.  No additional evidence shall be heard or taken by the superior court on appeals from the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. (a) The New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board fund is established as a special fund in the state treasury.  The fund shall be revolving, continually appropriated and nonlapsing.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all fees and civil penalties collected as provided in this chapter shall be paid into the state treasury immediately upon collection and credited to the motor vehicle industry board fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To fund the New Hampshire motor vehicle industry board fund and to pay the start-up expenses of administration and enforcement of this chapter, the board shall impose an initial start-up fee upon each new motor vehicle dealer of $100 for each vehicle make represented by that dealer, and an initial start-up fee of $1,000 for each manufacturer which sells or distributes new motor vehicles within the state.  However, in no case shall the initial start-up fee imposed upon any new motor vehicle dealer exceed $500 per year.  Upon the filing of a protest under this chapter, the protesting party shall pay into the fund a fee of $1,500.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner of safety may draw upon the fund, established in subparagraph (a), to pay the expenses of administration and enforcement of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board shall establish all fees, in addition to the initial start-up fees, required under this chapter in accordance with RSA 357-C:12, I(c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner of safety shall have the authority to impose an additional operational fee upon any motor vehicle dealer or manufacturer which sells or distributes new motor vehicles within the state in addition to the initial start-up fee imposed pursuant to this section, if the commissioner determines that the imposition of such fee is necessary to fund the ongoing operations of the board.  However, in no case shall the additional operational fee imposed exceed $500 per year for any motor vehicle dealer and $1000 per year for any manufacturer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any agreement or franchise or the terms or provisions of any waiver, any person whose business or property is injured by a violation of this chapter, or any person so injured because such person refuses to accede to a proposal for an arrangement which, if consummated, would be in violation of this chapter, may bring a civil action in the superior court to recover the actual damages sustained by such person together with the costs of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. In cases where the board finds that a violation of this chapter has occurred or there has been a failure to show good cause under RSA 357-C:7 or RSA 357-C:9, the superior court, upon petition, shall determine reasonable attorney's fees and costs and award them to the prevailing party.
