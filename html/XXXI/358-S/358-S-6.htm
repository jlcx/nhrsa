&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 358-S:6 Buyer's Rights. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Every seller of a martial arts instruction term or monthly contract shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Refund to the buyer the pro rata cost of any unused services, within 15 days after request therefor, if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The buyer is unable to receive benefits from the seller's services by reason of death, disability, or extended illness beyond 3 months.  The martial arts school may require that the disability or extended illness be confirmed by an examination of a physician agreeable to the member and the martial arts school, provided, however, that this subparagraph shall not operate to prevent the buyer from proving the disability in a judicial proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The seller relocates the facility more than 8 miles from its present location, or the services provided by the seller are materially impaired.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The buyer moves more than 25 miles away from the martial arts school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Refund to the buyer the pro rata cost of any unused services within 15 days after the martial arts school ceases operation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances enumerated in subparagraphs I(a) or (b) of this section, the buyer or the buyer's estate shall be relieved of any further obligation for payment under the contract not then due and owing.
