<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Prior to sending the demand letter, the person fails to conduct an analysis comparing the claims in the patent to the target's products, services, and technology, or such an analysis was done but does not identify specific areas in which the products, services, and technology are covered by the claims in the patent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The demand letter lacks the information described in subparagraph II(a), the target requests the information, and the person fails to provide the information within a reasonable period of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The demand letter demands payment of a license fee or response within an unreasonably short period of time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The person offers to license the patent for an amount that is not based on a reasonable estimate of the value of the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The claim or assertion of patent infringement is meritless, and the person knew or should have known that the claim or assertion is meritless.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The claim or assertion of patent infringement is deceptive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The person or its subsidiaries or affiliates have previously filed or threatened to file one or more lawsuits based on the same or a similar claim of patent infringement;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Those threats or lawsuits lacked the information described in subparagraph II(a);  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The person attempted to enforce the claim of patent infringement in litigation and a court found the claim to be meritless.

(a) The demand letter contains the information described in subparagraph II(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The person engages in a good faith effort to establish that the target has infringed the patent and to negotiate an appropriate remedy.
