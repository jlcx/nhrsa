<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Whenever the attorney general has reason to believe that trade or commerce declared unlawful by this chapter has been, is being or is about to be conducted by any person, the attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state against such person to restrain by temporary or permanent injunction the use of such trade or commerce and may petition the court for an order of restitution of money or property to any person or class of persons injured thereby.  The action may be brought in the superior court of the county in which the person allegedly in violation of this chapter resides or in which the principal place of business is located, or, with the consent of the parties or if the person is a nonresident and has no place of business within the state, in the superior court of Merrimack county.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon a finding that any person has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice declared unlawful by this chapter, the court may make any necessary order or judgment and may award to the state civil penalties up to $10,000 for each violation of this chapter.  No such order shall require the payment of civil penalties until the process of appeal has been exhausted.  Any such order or judgment shall be prima facie evidence in any action brought under RSA 358-A:10 that the respondent has engaged in an act or practice declared unlawful by this chapter.  For the purpose of this section, the court shall determine the number of unlawful acts or practices which have occurred without regard to the number of persons affected thereby.  It shall be an affirmative defense to the assessment of civil penalties that the defendant acted pursuant to a good faith misunderstanding concerning the requirements of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. In connection with any action brought under paragraph III, the attorney general may also petition the court to appoint a receiver to take charge of the business of any person during the course of litigation when the attorney general has reason to believe that such an appointment is necessary to prevent such person from continuing to engage in any act or practice declared unlawful by this chapter and of preserving the assets of said person to restore to any other person any money or property acquired by any unlawful act or practice.  The receiver shall have the authority to sue for, collect, receive and take into the receiver's possession all the goods and chattels, rights and credits, moneys and effects, lands and tenements, books, records, documents, papers, choses in action, bills, notes and property of every description, including property with which such property has been mingled if it cannot be identified in kind because of such commingling derived by means of any unlawful act or practice, and to sell, convey and assign the same and hold, dispose and distribute the proceeds thereof under the direction of the court.  Any person who has suffered damages as a result of the use of any unlawful act or practice and submits proof to the satisfaction of the court that such person has in fact been damaged, may participate with general creditors in the distribution of the assets to the extent that the person has sustained out-of-pocket losses.  In the case of a partnership or business entity, the receiver shall settle the estate and distribute the assets under the direction of the court.  The court shall have jurisdiction of all questions arising in such proceedings and may make such orders and judgments as may be required.  In lieu of the foregoing procedure, the court may permit any person alleged to have violated this chapter to post a bond in a manner and in an amount to be fixed by the court.  The bond shall be made payable to the state and may be distributed by the court only after a decision on the merits and the process of appeals has been exhausted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any county attorney or law enforcement officer receiving notice of any alleged violation of this chapter shall immediately forward written notice of the same with any other information that the county attorney or law enforcement officer may have to the department of justice.

Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing the attorney general, in cases in which the attorney general is authorized to bring an action, from accepting in lieu thereof an assurance of discontinuance of any act or practice which violates this chapter.  Such assurance may include a stipulation for the voluntary payment by the alleged violator of the costs of investigation by the attorney general, or of an amount to be held in escrow pending the outcome of an action, or of an amount to restore to any person any money or real or personal property which may have been acquired by such alleged violator, or all 3.  Any such assurance of discontinuance shall be in writing and be filed with the superior court of Merrimack county.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 358-A:10-a Class Actions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Persons entitled to bring an action under RSA 358-A:10 may, if the unlawful act or practice has caused similar injury to numerous other persons, institute an action as representative or representatives of a class of persons who are residents of this state or whose cause of action arose within this state against one or more defendants as individuals or as representatives of a class or against one or more such defendants having a principal place of business within this state, and the petition shall allege such facts as will show that these persons or the named defendants specifically named and served with process have been fairly chosen and adequately and fairly represent the whole class, to recover actual damages as provided for in RSA 358-A:10.  The court may require the plaintiff to prove such allegations, unless all of the members of the class have entered their appearance, and the court may also determine that it shall not be sufficient to prove such facts by the admissions of the defendants who have entered their appearance.  In any action brought under this section, the court may order, in addition to actual damages, injunctive or other equitable relief and reasonable attorney's fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An action may be maintained as a class action if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) There are questions of law or fact common to the class;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class;  and, in addition
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e)(1) The prosecution of a separate action by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. Inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. Adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  The matters pertinent to the findings include:  the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;  the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class;  the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum;  and the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained.  Such order may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In any class action maintained other than under paragraph II(e)(2), the court shall direct to the members of the class the best notice practicable under the rules of court, which may include either individual notice or publication or both as determined by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under paragraph II(e)(2), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and describe those whom the court finds to be members of the class.  The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under paragraph II(e)(1) or (3), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and specify or describe those who have requested inclusion and those who have not requested exclusion as provided in paragraph IV, and whom the court finds to be members of the class.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. When appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues, or a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and this section shall then be construed and applied accordingly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In the conduct of actions to which this section applies, the court may make appropriate orders:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Determining the course of proceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Requiring, for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct to some or all of the members of any step in the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come into the action;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Imposing conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Requiring that the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent persons, and that the action proceed accordingly;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Dealing with similar procedural matters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. An action once determined to be a class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Upon commencement of any action brought under this section, the clerk of the court shall mail a copy of the complaint or other initial pleading to the attorney general and, upon entry of any judgment or decree in the action, shall mail a copy of such judgment or decree to the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. (a) The judgment in an action maintained as a class action, whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and describe those to whom notice was directed, and whom the court finds to be members of the class and, in an action in which a money judgment is sought, shall not affect the rights of any person who was not included through use of the judgment by way of collateral estoppel or otherwise.  In an action in which a money judgment is sought and which is determined in favor of the members of the class, after proof by each member of the existence and extent of that member's actual monetary damage, judgment shall be entered stating the amount awarded to each such member, and the total amount of damages assessed against the defendant shall not exceed the aggregate of the total amount awarded to each such member plus legal expenses and costs as awarded by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the court renders judgment in favor of a plaintiff class, the court may order the defendant to pay damages directly to members of the class, or order the defendant to pay damages into the court and require each member of the class to file a claim with the court.  If within one year after the date of final judgment, any plaintiff fails to file a claim for damages actually awarded the plaintiff or cannot be located despite diligent efforts by the parties, the amount of damages actually awarded the plaintiff will be refunded to the paying defendant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any judgment awarding damages to one party against a second party in a class action or counterclaim therein may be set off against any other judgment awarding damages to the second party against the first party in such action or counterclaim.
