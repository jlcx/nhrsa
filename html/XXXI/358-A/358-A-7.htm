&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 358-A:7 Assurance of Discontinuance. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing the attorney general, in cases in which the attorney general is authorized to bring an action, from accepting in lieu thereof an assurance of discontinuance of any act or practice which violates this chapter.  Such assurance may include a stipulation for the voluntary payment by the alleged violator of the costs of investigation by the attorney general, or of an amount to be held in escrow pending the outcome of an action, or of an amount to restore to any person any money or real or personal property which may have been acquired by such alleged violator, or all 3.  Any such assurance of discontinuance shall be in writing and be filed with the superior court of Merrimack county.  Matters thus closed may be reopened by the attorney general at any time it is in the public interest.  Evidence of a violation of such assurance shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act or practice declared to be unlawful by this chapter in any action thereafter commenced by the attorney general.
