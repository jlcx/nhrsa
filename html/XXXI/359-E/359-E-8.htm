&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Telemarketers are prohibited from conducting telemarketing sales calls to any customer who has registered his or her name or telephone number with the do-not-call registry maintained by the list administrator or Federal Trade Commission.  In the case of telemarketers regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, this chapter shall apply in a manner consistent with rules concerning a national do-not-call list developed by that agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In addition, any person who is required to comply with the Federal Trade Commission Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 C.F.R. part 310, as amended, shall also comply with the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Telemarketing Sales Rule for telemarketing sales calls made within the state of New Hampshire.  This section shall also apply to any person who would be required to comply with the Federal Trade Commission Telemarketing Sales Rule, if such person were making interstate telemarketing sales calls.
