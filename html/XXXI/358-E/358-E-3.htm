<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The grantor shall file with the attorney general a financial statement of the grantor, audited by an independent certified public accountant, as of the close of the most recent fiscal year of the grantor.  If any material changes in the financial condition of the grantor occur after such statement is prepared, the grantor must disclose such changes and explain their significance to the operation of a distributorship.  The attorney general may, in his discretion, waive the requirement for audited statements for grantors who have not previously had such certified audits, provided the unaudited financial statement is prepared by an independent certified public accountant.  If the grantor is controlled by any person who absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to assume the duties and obligations of the grantor under the distributorship agreement should the grantor become unable to perform, the attorney general may, in his discretion, accept a consolidated financial statement from the grantor and such person.  If the attorney general finds that a grantor has failed to demonstrate that adequate financial arrangements have been made to fulfill the obligations set forth in the distributorship agreement, the attorney general may require the escrow or impoundment of fees and other funds paid by the distributor or distributors until such obligations have been fulfilled, or, at the option of the grantor, the furnishing of a surety bond as provided by rule or order of the attorney general, if he finds that such requirement is necessary and appropriate to protect distributors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon satisfactory submission of the information and documents required by paragraphs I and II and the payment of a registration fee of $50, the attorney general shall issue a certificate stating that the distributorship has been registered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The attorney general may accept any registration filed with agencies of the United States or any other state, in lieu of the filing required by this chapter, if he determines the acceptance of such registration will adequately protect the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The attorney general may from time to time by order exempt from the provisions of this chapter any distributorship if he finds that the enforcement of all the provisions of this chapter with respect to such distributorship is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of distributors due to the limited character of the distributorship, or the small amount of money involved or because such distributorship is, in the judgment of the attorney general, otherwise adequately regulated by federal or state law or because such distributorship has been registered and approved pursuant to the laws of the United States or any other state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The grantor shall immediately notify the attorney general of any material change in information contained in the application for registration and shall make appropriate amendment of the disclosure statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. [Repealed.]
