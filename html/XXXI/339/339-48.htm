No person shall sell, offer for sale, have in possession with intent to sell, deal in, supply or give away any wood alcohol or methyl alcohol, either crude or refined, under or by whatever name the same may be called or known, or however manufactured, and whether in concentrated or dilute form, unless the container in which the same is sold, delivered, offered for sale, possessed for sale, dealt in, supplied, or given away shall bear a label or tag with the following conspicuously printed in red thereon, viz.:

"WARNING--Methanol is a violent poison.  It cannot be taken internally without inducing blindness and general physical decay, with death resulting either soon or ultimately.  Inhalation of its vapors or prolonged contact with the skin are to be avoided.  Its use in any article of food, beverage or medicinal or toilet preparation for human use internally or externally is unlawful.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Provided, however, that where wood alcohol or methyl alcohol is added by the vendor direct to the radiator of an automobile, the labeling here stipulated shall not be required.  But no person shall sell, offer for sale, have in possession with intent to sell, deal in, or supply any wood alcohol or methyl alcohol, offered or intended for other than industrial use, unless the said alcohol has added to it a dye, such as to impart a conspicuous color.
