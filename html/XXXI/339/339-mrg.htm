I. All persons who shall offer for sale or sell gasoline or diesel fuel at retail shall post the price of all grades and services of such fuel in at least 2 of the following ways:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) On a price sign affixed to the fuel dispenser in numerals not less than 4 inches high and  3/4 of an inch in width;  such price signs shall be placed on the dispenser so that they are clearly visible from both sides of the dispenser from either direction of a motorist's approach;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) On a stationary roadside fuel price sign;  the stationary roadside fuel sign must be clearly visible from the street;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) By a digital unit price indicator or an analog unit price indicator on the face of the dispenser;  the indicators must display the actual price of the fuel pumped.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. When a grade, blend, or mixture of gasoline or diesel fuel is sold from a single dispenser for a regular price and a cash discount price, both unit prices shall be posted on the dispenser in accordance with subparagraph I(a) and either subparagraph I(b) or I(c).  Roadside signs advertising the cash discount price of gasoline or diesel fuel shall disclose that the advertised price is limited to cash purchases and display the word "cash'' next to the cash discount price.  The letters in the word "cash'' or other words of disclosure shall be of the same height and width as the numerals of the cash discount price.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Numerals indicating fractions or portions of whole numbers on any posted price shall be at least  1/2 the size of the whole number on such display, and all posted prices shall reflect the total price of such fuel, including all taxes thereon.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a computing device is part of the fuel dispensing equipment, it shall compute the total price for single purchases at all the unit prices for which the grade, blend, or mixture of gasoline or diesel fuel being dispensed is offered for sale, except for the unit prices charged by contract for fleet sales and similar price-contract sales.  When a grade, blend, or mixture of fuel is offered for sale at more than one unit price through a dispenser with a computing device:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The unit price for a transaction shall be selected by controls on the dispenser to be used by the customer;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) A printed receipt of the transaction shall be made available to the customer, showing unit price, the total number of gallons dispensed, and the total price of the sale issued mechanically by the dispenser;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A printed receipt shall be made available to the customer, showing the unit price, the total number of gallons dispensed, and the total price of the sale from a person attending the dispenser or the store where the fuel is offered for sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. When a special sale price or promotional discount price is offered on a grade, blend, or mixture of gasoline or diesel fuel, the dispenser shall be set to compute transactions at the special sale price or promotional discount price.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any person who shall violate the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a violation.
