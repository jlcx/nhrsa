<center><h3>Section 350-B:2</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 350-B:2 Injunctive Relief. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined.  Upon application to the court, an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited.  Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 350-B:3 Damages. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation.  Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss.  In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under paragraph I.
