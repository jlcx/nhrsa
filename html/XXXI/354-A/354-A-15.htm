&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 354-A:15 Housing for Older Persons. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
No provisions in this chapter regarding familial status or age apply with respect to housing for older persons.  Housing for older persons means housing:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Provided under any state or federal program that the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development determines is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons as defined in the state or federal program;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years or older per unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In determining whether housing qualifies as housing for persons 55 years or older, the commission shall adopt rules which require at least the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities and service is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons by reason of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Persons residing in such housing as of September 13, 1988, who do not meet the age requirements of paragraphs II or III, provided, that new occupants of such housing meet the age requirements of paragraph II or III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Unoccupied units, provided, that such units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of paragraph II or III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any rule concerning the exemption available under this section shall be consistent with federal law.  In adopting such rules, the commission shall be guided by applicable federal regulations and interpretations concerning housing for older persons under 42 U.S.C. section 3607(b).
