Such proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court, together with a written transcript of the record upon the hearing before the commission in the case of a petition for judicial review, and issuance and service of a summons as in proceedings in equity.  The court shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript an order or decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission, with full power to issue injunctions against any respondent and to punish for contempt of court.
