<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For purposes of this section, "discrimination'' includes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person with a disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may where it is reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, a failure to design and construct those dwellings in such a manner that:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American National Standard for buildings and facilities providing accessibility and usability for physically disabled people (commonly cited as "ANSI A117.1'') suffices to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph III(c)(3).
