&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 354-A:1 Title and Purposes of Chapter. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
This chapter shall be known as the "Law Against Discrimination.''  It shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare, health and peace of the people of this state, and in fulfillment of the provisions of the constitution of this state concerning civil rights.  The general court hereby finds and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants because of age, sex, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability or national origin are a matter of state concern, that such discrimination not only threatens the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state and threatens the peace, order, health, safety and general welfare of the state and its inhabitants.  A state agency is hereby created with power to eliminate and prevent discrimination in employment, in places of public accommodation and in housing accommodations because of age, sex, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability or national origin as herein provided;  and the commission established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.  In addition, the agencies and councils so created shall exercise their authority to assure that no person be discriminated against on account of sexual orientation.

<codesect>
It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For an employer, because of the age, sex, race, color, marital status, physical or mental disability, religious creed, or national origin of any individual, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.

In addition, no person shall be denied the benefit of the rights afforded by this paragraph on account of that person's sexual orientation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For any employee to be required, as a condition of employment, to retire upon or before reaching a specified predetermined chronological age, or after completion of a specified number of years of service unless such employee was elected or appointed for a specified term or required to retire pursuant to Pt. II, Art. 78 of the constitution of New Hampshire.  It shall not be unlawful for an employer to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Establish a normal retirement age, based on chronological age or length of service or both, which may be used to govern eligibility for and accrual of pension or other retirement benefits;  provided that such normal retirement age shall not be used to justify retirement of or failure to hire any individual;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Require any individual employee to retire on the basis of a finding that the employee can no longer meet such bona fide, reasonable standards of job performance as the employer may have established.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Harassment on the basis of sex constitutes unlawful sex discrimination.  Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when:
<br>

(a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;  or
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) For the purposes of this chapter, the word "sex'' includes pregnancy and medical conditions which result from pregnancy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An employer shall permit a female employee to take leave of absence for the period of temporary physical disability resulting from pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions.  When the employee is physically able to return to work, her original job or a comparable position shall be made available to her by the employer unless business necessity makes this impossible or unreasonable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For all other employment related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions shall be considered temporary disabilities, and a female employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated in the same manner as any employee affected by any other temporary disability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) For any employer not to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For any employer to deny employment opportunities, compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment to a job applicant or employee who is a qualified individual with a disability, if such denial is based on the need of such employer to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental impairments of the applicant or employee.

<codesect>
It shall be unlawful:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a disability of:

III. For purposes of this section, "discrimination'' includes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person with a disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may where it is reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years or older per unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities and service is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons by reason of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Persons residing in such housing as of September 13, 1988, who do not meet the age requirements of paragraphs II or III, provided, that new occupants of such housing meet the age requirements of paragraph II or III.

(b) Unoccupied units, provided, that such units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of paragraph II or III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 354-A:21 Procedure on Complaints. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice may make, sign and file with the commission a verified complaint in writing which shall state the name and address of the person, employer, labor organization, employment agency or public accommodation alleged to have committed the unlawful discriminatory practice complained of and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be required by the commission.  The attorney general or one of the commissioners may, in like manner, make, sign, and file such complaint.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In connection with the filing of such complaint, the attorney general is authorized to take proof, issue subpoenas and administer oaths in the manner provided in the civil practice law and rules.  Any employer whose employees, or some of them, refuse or threaten to refuse to cooperate with the provisions of this chapter, may file with the commission a verified complaint asking for assistance by conciliation or other remedial action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) After the filing of any complaint, one of the commissioners designated by the chair shall make, with the assistance of the commission's staff, prompt investigation in connection therewith;  during the course of the investigation, the commission shall encourage the parties to resolve their differences through settlement negotiations;  and if such commissioner shall determine after such investigation that probable cause exists for crediting the allegations of the complaint, the commissioner shall immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful discriminatory practice complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion.  The members of the commission and its staff shall not disclose what has occurred in the course of such endeavors, provided that the commission may publish the facts in the case of any complaint which has been dismissed, and the terms of conciliation when the complaint has been so disposed of.  When the investigating commissioner finds no probable cause to credit the allegations in the complaint, the complaint shall be dismissed, subject to a right of appeal to superior court.  To prevail on appeal, the moving party shall establish that the commission decision is unlawful or unreasonable by a clear preponderance of the evidence.  The findings of the investigating commissioner upon questions of fact shall be upheld as long as the record contains credible evidence to support them.  If it reverses the finding of the investigating commissioner, the superior court shall remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with RSA 354-A:21, II, unless the complainant or respondent elects to proceed with a hearing in superior court pursuant to RSA 354-A:21-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In case of failure to eliminate an unlawful discriminatory practice complained of, or in advance thereof, if, in the judgment of the commissioner making the investigation, circumstances so warrant, the commissioner shall cause to be issued and served in the name of the commission, a written notice, together with a copy of such complaint, as the same may have been amended, requiring the person, employer, labor organization or employment agency named in such complaint, hereinafter referred to as respondent, to answer charges of such complaint at a hearing before 3 members of the commission, designated by the chair and sitting as the commission, at a time and place to be fixed by the chair and specified in such notice.  The place of any such hearing shall be the office of the commission or such other place as may be designated by it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The case in support of the complaint may be presented before the commission by the complainant or complainant's representative and the commissioner who shall have previously made the investigation and caused the notice to be issued shall not participate in the hearing except as a witness, nor shall he participate in the subsequent deliberation of the commission in such case;  and the aforesaid endeavors at conciliation shall not be received in evidence.  The respondent shall file a written verified answer to the complaint and appear at such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, and submit testimony.  The commission or the complainant shall have the power reasonably and fairly to amend any complaint, and the respondent shall have like power to amend his other answer.  The commission shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity.  The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and transcribed at the request of any party.  The cost of transcription shall be borne by the party requesting the transcript unless the party is indigent, in which case the commission shall pay the cost.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If, upon all the evidence at the hearing, the commission shall find that a respondent has engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in this chapter, the commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take such affirmative action, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, or the extension of full, equal and unsegregated accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges to all persons, as in the judgment of the commission, will effectuate the purpose of this chapter and including a requirement for report of the manner of compliance.  Such cease and desist orders for affirmative relief may be issued to operate prospectively.  The commission may also order compensatory damages to be paid to the complainant by the respondent and, in order to vindicate the public interest, order the respondent to pay an administrative fine.  The administrative fine shall be deposited in the general fund.  The amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) $10,000 if the respondent has not been adjudged to have committed any prior discriminatory practice in any administrative hearing or civil action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) $25,000 if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed a prior discriminatory practice in any administrative hearing or civil action and the adjudication was made no more than 5 years prior to the date of filing the current charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) $50,000 if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed 2 or more discriminatory practices in any administrative hearings or civil actions and the adjudications were made during the 7-year period preceding the date of filing of the charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) When issuing an order awarding back pay, the commission shall calculate the back pay award by determining the amount the complainant would have earned but for the unlawful discriminatory practice.  The commission shall subtract from that amount any unemployment compensation or interim earnings received by the complainant for the time period covered by the back pay award.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If upon all the evidence the commission shall find that a respondent has not engaged in any such unlawful discriminatory practice, the commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant an order dismissing the said complaint as to such respondent.  A copy of its order shall be delivered in all cases to the attorney general, and such other public officers as the commission deems relevant or proper.  The commission shall establish rules of practice to govern, expedite, and effectuate the foregoing procedure and its own actions thereunder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any complaint filed pursuant to this section by an aggrieved person must be filed within 180 days after the alleged act of discrimination.  Any complaint filed pursuant to this section by the attorney general or one of the commissioners must be so filed within 180 days after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In administering this section, the commission shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 541-A:29, II, but shall close each case or commence adjudicative proceedings on such case under RSA 354-A:21 within 24 months after the filing date of the complaint.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any party alleging to be aggrieved by any practice made unlawful under this chapter may, at the expiration of 180 days after the timely filing of a complaint with the commission, or sooner if the commission assents in writing, but not later than 3 years after the alleged unlawful practice occurred, bring a civil action for damages or injunctive relief or both, in the superior court for the county in which the alleged unlawful practice occurred or in the county of residence of the party.  Any party alleged to have committed any practice made unlawful under this chapter may, in any case in which a determination of probable cause has been made by the investigating commissioner, remove said complaint to superior court for trial.  A court in cases so removed may award all damages and relief which could have been awarded by the commission, except that in lieu of an administrative fine, enhanced compensatory damages may be awarded when the court finds the respondent's discriminatory conduct to have been taken with willful or reckless disregard of the charging party's rights under this chapter.  A superior court trial shall not be available to any party if a hearing before the commission has begun or has concluded pursuant to RSA 354-A:21, II(b), or to a complainant whose charge has been dismissed as lacking in probable cause who has not prevailed on an appeal to superior court pursuant to RSA 354-A:21, II(a).  In superior court, either party is entitled to a trial by jury on any issue of fact in an action for damages regardless of whether the complaining party seeks affirmative relief.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The charging party shall notify the commission of the filing of any superior court action, and the respondent shall notify the commission of the removal to superior court after a finding of probable cause.  After such notice, the commission shall dismiss the complaint without prejudice.  A party electing to file a civil action with the superior court under paragraph I shall be barred from bringing any subsequent complaint before the commission based upon the same alleged unlawful discriminatory practice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The commission may, after a finding of probable cause, bring suit in superior court at its own expense on behalf of an aggrieved person in housing discrimination cases.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 354-A:22 Judicial Review and Enforcement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any complainant, respondent or other person aggrieved by such order of the commission may obtain judicial review of the order, and the commission or any interested person may obtain an order of court for its enforcement, in a proceeding as provided in this section.  Such proceeding shall be brought in the superior court of the state within any county in which the unlawful practice which is the subject of the commission's order occurs or in which any person required in the order to cease and desist from an unlawful practice or to take other affirmative action resides or transacts business.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court, together with a written transcript of the record upon the hearing before the commission in the case of a petition for judicial review, and issuance and service of a summons as in proceedings in equity.  The court shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript an order or decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission, with full power to issue injunctions against any respondent and to punish for contempt of court.  No objection that has not been urged before the commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.  In petitions to enforce commission orders, the court may, in its discretion, award the complaining party reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any party may move the court to remit the case to the commission in the interests of justice for the purpose of adducing additional specified and material evidence and seeking findings thereon, or in the alternative to move the court to accept such additional evidence itself, provided he shows reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence before the commission.  The superior court shall have the authority to make all rulings of law, findings of fact and determinations of damages and fines, if any, notwithstanding any such rulings, findings or determinations made by the commission.  All such proceedings shall be heard and determined by the court as expeditiously as possible and shall take precedence over all other matters before it, except matters of like nature.  The jurisdiction of the superior court shall be exclusive and its final order or decree shall be subject to review by the supreme court in the same manner and form and with the same effect as in appeals from a final order or decree in proceedings in equity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commission's copy of the testimony shall be available at all reasonable times to all parties for examination and for the purposes of judicial review of the order of the commission.  The review shall be heard on the record without requirement of printing.  The commission may appear in court by one of its attorneys.  A proceeding under this section when instituted by any complainant, respondent or other person aggrieved must be instituted within 30 days after the service of the order of the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the complainant brings an action in federal court arising out of the same claims of discrimination which formed the basis of an order or decision of the commission, such order or decision shall be vacated and any appeal therefrom pending in any state court shall be dismissed.

No provision of this chapter shall be deemed to supersede any other provision of law for the protection of minors or for the regulation of the employment of minors.  The provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to repeal any of the provisions of the civil rights law or any other law of this state relating to discrimination because of age, sex, race, creed, color, marital status, physical or mental disability or national origin;  but, as to acts declared unlawful by this chapter the procedure provided in this chapter shall, while pending, be exclusive and the final determination therein shall exclude any other action, civil or criminal, based on the same grievance of the individual concerned.  If such individual institutes any action based on such grievance without resorting to the procedure provided in this chapter, such person may not subsequently resort to the procedure in this chapter, provided, however, that nothing in this section shall prevent any individual from applying for or receiving unemployment compensation while the procedure provided for in this chapter is pending or after the procedure provided in this chapter has been concluded.  This section shall not prevent the commission for human rights from investigating and acting upon a complaint of discrimination when the complainant has also filed a claim for unemployment compensation in which the issue of illegal discrimination is raised.
