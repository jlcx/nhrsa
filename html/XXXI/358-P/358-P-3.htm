&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 358-P:3 General Requirements of Disclosure. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The rent-to-own dealer shall disclose to the consumer the information required by RSA 358-P:4.  In a transaction involving more than one rent-to-own dealer, only one such dealer need make the disclosures, but all rent-to-own dealers shall be bound by such disclosures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The disclosures shall be made at or before consummation of the rent-to-own agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The disclosures shall be made clearly and conspicuously in writing and a copy of the rent-to-own agreement provided to the consumer.  The disclosures required under RSA 358-P:4 shall be made on the face of the contract above the line for the consumer's signature.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a disclosure becomes inaccurate as the result of any act, occurrence or agreement by the consumer after delivery of the required disclosures, the resulting inaccuracy shall not be a violation of this chapter.
