<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A consumer who fails to make a timely rental payment may reinstate the agreement, without losing any rights or options which exist under the agreement, by the payment of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All past due rental charges;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the property has been picked up, the reasonable costs of pick-up and redelivery;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any applicable late fee, within 5 days of the renewal date if the consumer pays monthly, or within 2 days of the renewal date if the consumer pays more frequently than monthly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the case of a consumer who has paid less than  2/3 of the total of payments necessary to acquire ownership and where the consumer has returned or voluntarily surrendered the property, other than through judicial process, during the applicable reinstatement period set forth in paragraph I of this section, the consumer may reinstate the agreement during a period of not less than 21 days after the date of the return of the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of a consumer who has paid  2/3 or more of the total of payments necessary to acquire ownership, and where the consumer has returned or voluntarily surrendered the property, other than through judicial process, during the applicable period set forth in paragraph I of this section, the consumer may reinstate the agreement during a period of not less than 30 days after the date of the return of the property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall prevent the rent-to-own dealer from attempting to repossess property during the reinstatement period, but such a repossession shall not affect the consumer's right to reinstate.  Upon reinstatement, the rent-to-own dealer shall provide the consumer with the same property or substitute property of comparable quality and condition.
