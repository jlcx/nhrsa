<center><h3>Section 358-P:8</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 358-P:8 Reinstatement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A consumer who fails to make a timely rental payment may reinstate the agreement, without losing any rights or options which exist under the agreement, by the payment of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) All past due rental charges;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the property has been picked up, the reasonable costs of pick-up and redelivery;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Nothing in this section shall prevent the rent-to-own dealer from attempting to repossess property during the reinstatement period, but such a repossession shall not affect the consumer's right to reinstate.  Upon reinstatement, the rent-to-own dealer shall provide the consumer with the same property or substitute property of comparable quality and condition.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 358-P:11 Enforcement;  Penalties. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) A rent-to-own dealer who fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter is liable to the consumer damaged thereby in an amount equal to the greater of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the rent-to-own dealer's failure to comply with this chapter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) 25 percent of the total of payments necessary to acquire ownership, but not less than $100 nor more than $1,000.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A rent-to-own dealer who fails to comply with this chapter is also liable to the consumer for the costs of the action and reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A consumer may not take any action to offset the amount for which a rent-to-own dealer is potentially liable under paragraph I against any amount owed by the consumer, unless the amount of the dealer's liability has been determined by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action in which the rent-to-own dealer was a party.  This section shall not bar a consumer then in default on an obligation from asserting a violation of this chapter as an original action, or as a defense or counterclaim, to an action brought by a rent-to-own dealer against the consumer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The provisions of this section are in addition to any other rights or remedies available in this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No action under this section shall be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction more than one year after the date the consumer made the last rental payment or more than one year after the date of the occurrence of the violation that is the subject of the suit, whichever is later.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 358-P:12 Rent-to-Own Dealer's Defenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a rent-to-own dealer establishes by a preponderance of evidence that a violation of this chapter was unintentional or the result of a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors, no penalty as specified in RSA 358-P:11 may be imposed and validity of the transaction is not affected.  Examples of bona fide errors are clerical errors, calculation errors, errors due to unintentionally improper computer programming or data entry, and printing errors, but do not include an error of legal judgment with respect to a rent-to-own dealer's obligations under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A rent-to-own dealer shall not be liable under this section for any failure to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter if within 60 days after discovering an error, and prior to the institution of an action under this chapter or the receipt of written notice of the error from the consumer, the rent-to-own dealer notifies the consumer of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account as are necessary to assure that the consumer is not required to pay an amount in excess of the lowest charge actually disclosed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No provision of this chapter imposing any penalty applies to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with some provision of this chapter, notwithstanding that after the act or omission has occurred the provision is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid for any reason.
