In this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. "Biometric data'' includes, but is not limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Fingerprints, palm prints, and other methods for measuring or recording ridge pattern or fingertip characteristics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Facial feature pattern characteristics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Behavior characteristics of a handwritten signature, such as shape, speed, pressure, pen angle, or sequence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Voice data used for comparing live speech with a previously-created speech model of a person's voice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Iris recognition data containing color or texture patterns or codes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Keystroke dynamics, measuring pressure applied to key pads.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Hand geometry, measuring hand characteristics, including the shape and length of fingers, in 3 dimensions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Retinal scans, reading through the pupil to measure blood vessels lining the retina.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) DNA/RNA.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. "Government agency'' includes any employee, agent, elected official or entity of the state, a municipality, or any other political subdivision of the state of New Hampshire.
