&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-A:1 Prohibited Acts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The manufacture, sale or delivery, holding or offering for sale of any misbranded hazardous substance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The alteration, mutilation, destruction, obliteration, or removal of the whole or any part of the label of, or the doing of any other act with respect to, a hazardous substance, if such act is done while such substance is held for sale, and results in such substance being a misbranded hazardous substance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The giving of a guarantee or undertaking referred to in RSA 339-A:4, which guarantee or undertaking is false, except by a person who relied upon a guarantee or undertaking to the same effect signed by, and containing the name and address of, the person residing in the state from whom he received in good faith the hazardous substance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The refusal to permit entry or inspection, or to permit the taking of a sample, as authorized by RSA 339-A:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The removal or disposal of a detained or embargoed article in violation of RSA 339-A:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The use by any person to his own advantage, or revealing other than to the commissioner of the department of health and human services or employees of the department of health and human services, or to the courts when relevant, of any information acquired under authority of RSA 339-A:5 concerning any method of process which as a trade secret is entitled to protection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The delivery or proffered delivery, for pay or otherwise, of a hazardous substance in a reused food, drug or cosmetic container or in a container which, though not a reused container, is identifiable as a food, drug, or cosmetic container by its labeling or by other identification.  The reuse of a food, drug, or cosmetic container as a container for a hazardous substance shall be deemed to be an act which results in the hazardous substance being a misbranded hazardous substance.  As used in this paragraph the term "food,'' "drug,'' and "cosmetic'' shall have the same meaning as defined in RSA 146:2.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The term "commissioner'' means the commissioner of the department of health and human services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The term "hazardous substance'' means
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any substance or mixture of substances which is toxic, is corrosive, is an irritant, is a strong sensitizer, is flammable or generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other means, if such substance or mixture of substances may cause substantial personal injury or substantial illness during or as a proximate result of any customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use, including reasonably foreseeable ingestion by children;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any substance which the commissioner by regulation finds, pursuant to the provisions of RSA 339-A:5, meets the requirements of subparagraph (a);
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any radioactive substance, if, with respect to such substance as used in a particular class of articles or as packaged, the commissioner determines by regulation that the substance is sufficiently hazardous to require labeling in accordance with this chapter in order to protect the public health.
<br>
Provided, however, that the term "hazardous substance'' shall not apply to economic poisons subject to RSA 438, nor to products subject to RSA 153, nor to foods, drugs and cosmetics subject to RSA 146, nor to substances intended for use as fuels when stored in containers and used in the treating, cooking, or refrigeration systems of a house, but such term shall apply to any article which is not itself an economic poison within the meaning of RSA 438 but which is a hazardous substance within the meaning of this paragraph by reason of bearing or containing such an economic poison.  This term shall not include any source material, special nuclear material, or by-product material, defined in RSA 125 by the United States Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and regulations issued pursuant thereto by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The term "toxic'' means any substance (other than a radioactive substance) which has the capacity to produce personal injury or illness to man through ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through any body surface.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The term "highly toxic'' means any substance which falls within any of the following categories:  (a) produces death within 14 days in half or more than half of a group of 10 or more laboratory white rats each weighing between 200 and 300 grams, at a single dose of 50 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight, when orally administered;  or (b) produces death within 14 days in half or more than half of a group of 10 or more laboratory white rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams, when inhaled continuously for a period of one hour or less at an atmospheric concentration of 200 parts per million by volume or less of gas or vapor or 2 milligrams per liter by volume or less of mist or dust, provided such concentration is likely to be encountered by man when the substance is used in any reasonably foreseeable manner;  or (c) produces death within 14 days in half or more than half of a group of 10 or more rabbits tested in a dosage of 200 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight, when administered by continuous contact with the bare skin for 24 hours or less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the commissioner finds that available data on human experience with any substance indicates different results from those obtained on animals as set forth in paragraph IV, the human data shall take precedence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The term "corrosive'' means any substance which in contact with living tissue will cause destruction of tissue by chemical action;  but shall not refer to action on inanimate surfaces.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The term "irritant'' means any substance not corrosive within the meaning of paragraph VI which on immediate, prolonged, or repeated contact with normal living tissue will induce a local inflammatory reaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The term "strong sensitizer'' means a substance which will cause on normal living tissue through an allergic or photodynamic process a hypersensitivity which becomes evident on reapplication of the same substance and which is designated as such by the commissioner.  Before designating any substance as a strong sensitizer, the commissioner, upon consideration of the frequency of occurrence and severity of the reaction, shall find that the substance has a significant potential for causing hypersensitivity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The term "extremely flammable'' shall apply to any substance which has a flash point at or below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, as determined by the Tagliabue Open Cup Tester, and the term "flammable'' shall apply to any substance which has a flash point of above 20 degrees to and including 80 degrees Fahrenheit, as determined by the Tagliabue Open Cup Tester;  except that the flammability of solids and of the contents of self-pressurized containers shall be determined by methods found by the commissioner to be generally applicable to such materials or containers, respectively, and established by rules adopted under the authority of RSA 339-A:5, which rules shall also define the terms "flammable'' and "extremely flammable'' in accordance with such methods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The term "radioactive substance'' means a substance which emits ionizing radiation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The term "label'' means a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any substance or, in the case of an article which is unpackaged or is not packaged in an immediate container intended or suitable for delivery to the ultimate consumer, a display of such matter directly upon the article involved or upon a tag or other suitable material affixed thereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 339-A:5 Enforcement;  Regulations;  Exemptions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of health and human services is charged with the enforcement of this chapter.  All inspectors and employees of the department, upon presenting appropriate credentials, shall be permitted access, at reasonable times, to any factory, warehouse, or establishment in which hazardous substances are manufactured, processed, packed, or held for sale, or to enter any vehicle being used to transport or hold such hazardous substances for purposes of inspection for compliance with this chapter and to obtain samples, if desired, provided the value thereof is tendered to the manufacturer, distributor or vendor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Declaring any substance or mixture of substances to be a hazardous substance which he finds meets the requirements of RSA 339-A:2, II(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Establishing such reasonable variations or additional label requirements as may be found necessary for the protection of the public health and safety.  Any such hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household or by children, which fails to bear a label in accordance with such rules shall be deemed to be a misbranded hazardous substance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Flammability under RSA 339-A:2, IX.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(h) Procedures for notice and hearing prior to the imposition of an administrative fine imposed under RSA 339-A:7-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the commissioner finds that because of the size of the package involved or because of the minor hazard presented by the substance contained therein, or for other good and sufficient reasons, failure to comply with the labeling requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter is impracticable or is not necessary for the adequate protection of the public health and safety, the commissioner may adopt rules exempting such substance from the requirements to the extent he determines to be consistent with adequate protection to the public health.  The commissioner may exempt from the requirements established by or pursuant to this chapter any hazardous substance or any container of a hazardous substance with respect to which he finds that adequate requirements satisfying the purposes of this chapter have been established by or pursuant to any other state law or rules adopted under such law.
