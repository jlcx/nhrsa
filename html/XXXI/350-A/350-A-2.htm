&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 350-A:2 Registrability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A mark by which the goods or services of any applicant for registration may be distinguished from the goods or services of others shall not be registered if it:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive or scandalous matter;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Consists of or comprises matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Consists of or comprises, the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or of any state or municipality, or of any foreign nation, or any simulation thereof;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Consists of or comprises the name, signature or portrait of any living individual, except with his written consent;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Consists of a mark which, (a) when applied to the goods or services of the applicant, is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, or, (b) when applied to the goods or services of the applicant, is primarily geographically descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, or (c) is primarily merely a surname;  provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the registration of a mark used in this state by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods or services.  The secretary of state may accept as evidence that the mark has become distinctive, as applied to the applicant's goods or services, proof of continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant in this state or elsewhere for the 5 years next preceding the date of the filing of the application for registration;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in this state or a mark or trade name previously used in this state by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods or services of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.
