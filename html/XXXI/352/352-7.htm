&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An art dealer shall not accept a work of art, on a fee, commission, or other compensation basis, on consignment from the artist who created the work of art unless, prior to or at the time of acceptance, the art dealer enters into a written contract with the artist that contains all of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The value of the work of art and whether it may be sold;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The time within which the proceeds of the sale are to be paid to the artist, if the work of art is sold;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The minimum price for the sale of the work of art;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The fee or percentage of the sale price that is to be paid to the art dealer for displaying or selling the work of art;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) An agreed upon date for removal of artwork and date for termination of contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
