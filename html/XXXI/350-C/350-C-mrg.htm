&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 350-C:2 Ownership Rights to Dies, Molds, Forms and Patterns. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the customer shall have all rights and title to any die, mold, form, or pattern in the possession of the molder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a customer does not claim possession from a molder of a die, mold, form, or pattern within 3 years following the last prior use of such die, mold, form, or pattern, all rights and title to any die, mold, form, or pattern shall be transferred by operation of law to the molder for the purpose of destroying or otherwise disposing of such die, mold, form, or pattern, consistent with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a molder chooses to have all rights and title to any die, mold, form, or pattern, transferred to the molder by operation of law, the molder shall send written notice by registered mail to the chief executive office of the customer or, if the customer is not a business entity, to the customer at the customer's last known address indicating that the molder intends to terminate the customer's rights and title by having all such rights and title transferred to the molder by operation of law pursuant to this subdivision.  Such notice shall include a statement of the customer's rights as set forth in paragraph IV of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV.

Thereafter, the molder may destroy or otherwise dispose of the particular die, mold, form, or pattern as the molder's own property without any risk of liability to the customer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This subdivision shall not be construed in any manner to affect any right of the customer, under federal patent or copyright law or any state or federal law pertaining to unfair competition.

I. Molders shall have a lien, dependent on possession, on all dies, molds, forms or patterns in their hands belonging to a customer, for the balance due them from such customer for any manufacturing or fabrication work, and in the value of all material related to such work.

This notice shall state that a lien is claimed for the damages set forth in or attached to such writing for manufacturing or fabrication work contracted or performed for the customer.  This notice shall also include a demand for payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the molder has not been paid the amount due within 60 days after the notice has been received by the customer as provided in paragraph II, the molder may sell the die, mold, form, or pattern at a public auction if both of the following occur:
