&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the customer shall have all rights and title to any die, mold, form, or pattern in the possession of the molder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a customer does not claim possession from a molder of a die, mold, form, or pattern within 3 years following the last prior use of such die, mold, form, or pattern, all rights and title to any die, mold, form, or pattern shall be transferred by operation of law to the molder for the purpose of destroying or otherwise disposing of such die, mold, form, or pattern, consistent with this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a molder chooses to have all rights and title to any die, mold, form, or pattern, transferred to the molder by operation of law, the molder shall send written notice by registered mail to the chief executive office of the customer or, if the customer is not a business entity, to the customer at the customer's last known address indicating that the molder intends to terminate the customer's rights and title by having all such rights and title transferred to the molder by operation of law pursuant to this subdivision.  Such notice shall include a statement of the customer's rights as set forth in paragraph IV of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) If a customer does not respond in person or by mail to claim possession of the particular die, mold, form, or pattern within 120 days following the date the notice was sent, or does not make other contractual arrangements with the molder for storage of the die, mold, form, or pattern, all rights and title of the customer, except patents and copyrights, shall transfer by operation of law to the molder.  Thereafter, the molder may destroy or otherwise dispose of the particular die, mold, form, or pattern as the molder's own property without any risk of liability to the customer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This subdivision shall not be construed in any manner to affect any right of the customer, under federal patent or copyright law or any state or federal law pertaining to unfair competition.
