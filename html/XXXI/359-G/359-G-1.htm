&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 359-G:1 Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In order to encourage the out-of-court resolution of disputes between homeowners and contractors relative to residential construction defects, this chapter provides a framework for discussion about an alleged defect.  As part of this process, RSA 359-G:4, IV allows a homeowner to provide access to the residence for an inspection.  Since an inspection is likely to lead to the timely resolution of the problem, homeowners are encouraged, but not required, to provide access for an inspection.
