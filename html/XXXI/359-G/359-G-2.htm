<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. "Construction defect'' has the meaning assigned by a written, express warranty either provided by the contractor or required by applicable statutory law.  If no written, express warranty or applicable statutory warranty provides a definition, then "construction defect'' means a matter concerning the design, construction, modification, or repair of a residence about which a person has a complaint against a contractor.  The term may include any physical damage to the residence, any appurtenance, or the real property on which the residence or appurtenance is affixed, proximately caused by a construction defect.

A residence includes the systems, other components, improvements, other structures, or recreational facilities that are appurtenant to the house, duplex, or multifamily unit at the time of its initial sale, but not necessarily a part of the house, duplex, or multifamily unit.
