<codesect>
If any other provisions in the laws which relate to education shall be found by the state board to impose upon any district obligations which, by reason of unusual circumstances or of exceptional conditions in that district, result in an unnecessary expenditure of school money, or in a procedure which is inimical to the best interests of education therein, the state board, upon like proceedings, may suspend or modify such obligations as in its judgment may be reasonable.
