&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It shall be the duty of the school board to provide, at district expense, elementary and secondary education to all pupils who reside in the district until such time as the pupil has acquired a high school diploma or has reached age 21, whichever occurs first;  provided, that the board may exclude specific pupils for gross misconduct or for neglect or refusal to conform to the reasonable rules of the school, and further provided that this section shall not apply to pupils who have been exempted from school attendance in accordance with RSA 193:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Elected school boards shall be responsible for establishing the structure, accountability, advocacy, and delivery of instruction in each school operated and governed in its district.  To accomplish this end, and to support flexibility in implementing diverse educational approaches, school boards shall establish, in each school operated and governed in its district, instructional policies that establish instructional goals based upon available information about the knowledge and skills pupils will need in the future.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. School boards shall adopt a teacher performance evaluation system, with the involvement of teachers and principals, for use in the school district.  A school board may consider any resources it deems reasonable and appropriate, including any resources that may be provided by the state department of education.  In this paragraph, "teacher'' shall have the same meaning as in RSA 189:14-a, V.
