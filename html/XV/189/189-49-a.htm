&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 189:49-a Fingerprinting Program. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The state board of education in conjunction with the department of safety shall adopt a model fingerprinting program which shall be made available to the board of education of each school district in the state.  The state board of education shall encourage each school district to adopt this program in the interest of uniformity throughout the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the school district adopts the fingerprinting program it shall be for the sole purpose of providing a means by which a missing child might be located or identified and shall be operated on the following basis:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No student shall be required to participate in the program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In order for a student to participate in the program, the parents, custodial parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person responsible for the student shall authorize the student's participation by signing a form that shall be developed by the board of education or by the principal or chief administrative officer of the nonpublic school for the program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All fingerprint cards shall be given to the parents, custodial parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person responsible for a student after the fingerprinting of the student.  A copy of a fingerprint card may be retained by a school or school district, if written permission is given by the student's parent, guardian, or legal custodian.  The student, upon reaching the age of 18, or the parent at any time, shall have the right to have the card returned and no copy shall be retained by the school or school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The name, sex, hair and eye color, height, weight, and date and place of birth of the student and other information may be indicated on the fingerprint sheet or card.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Fingerprints obtained pursuant to this section, or any medical, psychological, guidance, counseling, or other information that is derived from the use of the fingerprints, shall not be admissible as evidence against the minor who is the subject of the fingerprints in any proceeding in any court, and shall not be used against the minor after the minor reaches the age of majority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A principal or chief administrative officer of a public school, or any employee of a public school who is authorized to handle school records, shall provide access to the relevant records of a student to a law enforcement officer who indicates that an investigation is being conducted by such officer and that the student is or may be a missing child.  Copies of information in the relevant records of a student shall be provided, upon request, to the law enforcement officer, if prior approval is given by the student's parent, guardian, or legal custodian.  Information obtained by the officer shall be used solely in the investigation of the case.  The information may be used by law enforcement agency personnel in any manner that is appropriate to solving the case, including, but not limited to, providing the information to other law enforcement officers and agencies and to the office of the attorney general, division of public protection, bureau of criminal justice, for purposes of computer integration pursuant to RSA 7:10-a.
