<codesect>
An elementary school is any school approved by the state board of education in which the subjects taught are those prescribed by the state board for the grades kindergarten through 8 of the public schools.  However, a separate organization consisting of grades 7 through 9, or any grouping of these grades, may be recognized as a junior high school and so approved by the board.  Also a separate organization consisting of grades 4 through 8 or any grouping of these grades may be recognized as a middle school and so approved by the state board.  Any elementary school may include a kindergarten program which, if it is provided, shall precede the other elementary grades.
