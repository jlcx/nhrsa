<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Any teacher who has a professional standards certificate from the state board of education and who has taught for one or more years in the same school district shall be notified in writing on or before April 15 or within 15 days of the adoption of the district budget by the legislative body, whichever is later, if that teacher is not to be renominated or reelected, provided that no notification shall occur later than the Friday following the second Tuesday in May.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) School boards shall have a teacher performance evaluation policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any such teacher who has taught for 5 consecutive years or more in the teacher's current school district, or who taught for 3 consecutive years or more in the teacher's current school district before July 1, 2011, and who has been so notified may request in writing within 10 days of receipt of said notice a hearing before the school board and may in said request ask for reasons for failure to be renominated or reelected.  For purposes of this section only, a leave of absence shall not interrupt the consecutive nature of a teacher's service, but neither shall such a leave be included in the computation of a teacher's service.  Computation of a teacher's service for any other purposes shall not be affected by this section.  The notice shall advise the teacher of all of the teacher's rights under this section.  The school board, upon receipt of said request, shall provide for a hearing on the request to be held within 15 days.  The school board shall issue its decision in writing within 15 days of the close of the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any teacher who has a professional standards certificate from the state board of education shall be entitled to all of the rights for notification and hearing in paragraphs I(b), III, and IV of this section if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The teacher has taught for 5 consecutive years or more in any school district in the state and has taught for 3 consecutive years or more in the teacher's current school district;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Before July 1, 2011, the teacher taught for 3 consecutive years or more in any school district in the state and taught for 2 consecutive years or more in the teacher's current school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In cases of nonrenomination or nonreelection because of reduction in force, the reduction in force shall not be based solely on seniority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In all proceedings before the school board under this section, the burden of proof for nonrenewal of a teacher shall be on the superintendent of the local school district by a preponderance of the evidence.  Except as provided in paragraph III, the grounds for nonrenomination and nonreelection shall be determined at the sole discretion of the school board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Teacher'' means any professional employee of any school district whose position requires certification as a professional engaged in teaching.  The term "teacher'' shall also include principals, assistant principals, librarians, and guidance counselors.
