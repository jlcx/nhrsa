&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 189:9-a Pupils Prohibited for Disciplinary Reasons. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 189:6-8, the superintendent, or a representative as designated in writing, is authorized to suspend the right of pupils from riding in a school bus when said pupils fail to conform to the reasonable rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the school board.  Any suspension to continue beyond 20 school days must be approved by the school board.  Said suspension shall not begin until the next school day following the day notification of suspension is sent to the pupil's parent or legal guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a pupil has been denied the right to ride a school bus for disciplinary reasons, the parent or guardian of that pupil has a right of appeal within 10 days of suspension to the authority that suspended this pupil's right.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Until the appeal is heard, or if the suspension of pupil's right to ride the school bus is upheld, it shall be the parents' or guardians' responsibility to provide transportation to and from school for that pupil for the period of the suspension.
