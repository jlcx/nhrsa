<center><h3>Section 200-E:1</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 200-E:1 Agreement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The Interstate Agreement on Qualification of Educational Personnel is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdiction legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:
<center>
<p>
<b>Article I</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Purpose, Findings, and Policy</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. The States party to this Agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.  It is the purpose of this Agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the States party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. The party States find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from State to State in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other States.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their States of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this Compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. The designated State official of a party State may make one or more contracts on behalf of his State with one or more other party States providing for the acceptance of educational personnel.  Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the States whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those States, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this Agreement.  A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this Article only with States in which he finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in his own State.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. Any such contract shall provide for:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Its duration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating State in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving State.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any other necessary matters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
3. No contract made pursuant to this Agreement shall be for a term longer than 5 years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
4. Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred.  No contract made pursuant to this Agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving State of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
5. The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated.  However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving State.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
6. A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting States or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting States.
