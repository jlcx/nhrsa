&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) When a child with a disability, as defined in RSA 186-C:2, needs special education and the parent or guardian of the child is unknown or after reasonable efforts cannot be located, or the child is in the legal custody of the division of children, youth, and families, the commissioner, or designee, may appoint a surrogate parent who shall represent the child in the educational decision-making process, provided that for a child in the legal custody of the division of children, youth, and families, a judge overseeing the child's case pursuant to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. section 1415(b)(2)(A)(i), may appoint a surrogate parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of a child who is an unaccompanied youth as defined in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. section 11434a(6), the school district shall appoint a surrogate parent pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Appointment of Surrogate.  Appointment of a surrogate parent under this section shall be effective until the child reaches 18 years of age, and may be extended by order of the commissioner until the child graduates from high school or reaches 21 years of age, whichever occurs first.  If the surrogate parent resigns, dies or is removed, the commissioner of the department of education or designee, or the court with jurisdiction over the child's case, may appoint a successor surrogate parent in the same manner as provided in paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Right of Access.  When a surrogate parent is appointed, the surrogate parent shall have the same right of access as the natural parents or guardian to all records concerning the child.  These records shall include, but not be limited to, educational, medical, psychological and health and human service records.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Limited Liability.  No surrogate parent appointed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph III or IV shall be liable to the child entrusted to the surrogate parent or the parents or guardian of such child for any civil damages which result from acts or omissions of such surrogate parent which may arise out of ordinary negligence.  This immunity shall not apply to acts or omissions constituting gross, willful, or wanton negligence.
