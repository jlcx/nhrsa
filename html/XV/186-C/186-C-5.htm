<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The state board of education shall adopt rules establishing a process and standards for the approval and monitoring of programs of education that are maintained by school districts, regional special education centers, and private organizations or state facilities for the benefit of children with disabilities, including chartered public schools, home-based programs and alternative schools or programs;  except, however, that approval of education programs for the special district established in RSA 194:60 shall be pursuant to the standards set forth in the interagency agreements between the department of corrections and the department of education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The division of educational improvement of the department of education, through its program approval and monitoring process shall determine if a district is making diligent efforts to resolve personnel shortages that result in children with disabilities being placed out of district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of program approval and monitoring is to ensure that the programs specified in paragraph I comply with applicable federal and state law, including standards related to improving educational results and functional outcomes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Program approval and monitoring shall utilize professionally recognized program evaluation and other verification methods to ensure reliable and valid findings and corrective actions.  The department shall develop and apply standards and procedures to determine whether each program specified in paragraph I complies with the requirements of applicable federal and state law.  Such standards shall give considerable weight to rigorous benchmarks or performance outcomes and indicators required by federal and state law most relevant to achieving educational results and functional outcomes.  Program approval and monitoring shall also include, but not be limited to the following components and processes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Reporting of outcome or indicator data by school district and non-district programs to the department in a manner and frequency as the department shall determine.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Development and application of methods to ensure the accuracy of all such data including data as entered in student records and as transmitted to the department, to include necessary on-site verification of data.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Determinations by the department as to whether the reported data complies with such standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) On-site monitoring to further evaluate noncompliance, verify accuracy of data, assess the adequacy of the corrective action plans and their implementation, or other purposes as the department may determine, which may include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Regular or periodic monitoring.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Special on-site monitoring required as part of the resolution or remediation of a complaint under 34 C.F.R. sections 300.151-152, or based on reliable information received indicating that there is reason to believe that there is noncompliance with standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Random or targeted visits which may be unannounced when the department determines that an unannounced visit is needed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Program monitoring, including the on-site monitoring components, shall use multiple program evaluation techniques in accordance with professionally recognized standards and to achieve the purposes set forth in paragraphs I-III, including, but not limited to, random sampling stratified as necessary to cover discrete sites or programs such as alternative programs or schools.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Program approval and monitoring personnel or teams, which shall be knowledgeable in research-based education, special education practices, professionally recognized program evaluation practices, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and state special education laws and which shall receive appropriate training to participate in the monitoring process.  Such personnel or teams for on-site monitoring shall consist of at least one of each of the following:  an educator, an educational administrator, and a parent who resides in another school district, who shall receive mileage reimbursement.  The department may determine that for certain on-site visits less than a full team is necessary.  The department directly or by contract shall develop and train a group of parents on the requisites needed to carry out the monitoring duties.  Where volunteers or contracted personnel are used for the non-parent team slots, attempts shall be made to use or balance teams with personnel from non-school district sources such as qualified individuals from higher education.  Educators and educational administrators that are used (1) may not review schools in school districts in which they are employed or have been employed in the previous 2 years and (2) may not be from schools which in the current or prior 3 years have been the subject of mandatory technical assistance under subparagraph V(e)(2) or any of the interventions in subparagraphs V(e)(3)-(12).  The department shall make available sufficient funds for stipends or similar financial remuneration, in addition to expense reimbursements to ensure that teams have a diversity of perspectives and high quality professional membership.  The department of education may contract with an individual or organization which has the requisite expertise and skill to perform the monitoring activities, and who is otherwise independent from school district and non-school district programs in New Hampshire.  This subparagraph shall not be construed to preclude individuals who may have performed sporadic or occasional contract or volunteer work for school district or non-school district programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The department shall issue a report granting full or conditional approval, or denying, suspending, or revoking approval prior to the expiration of the existing program approval which shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Findings detailing exemplary characteristics and strengths of each program and each instance of noncompliance and failure to meet performance outcome or indicator measures in accordance with standards set forth in paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Recommendations for actions needed to correct noncompliance or failure to meet performance outcome or indicator measures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) School districts and non-district programs may appeal decisions granting conditional approval or denying, suspending, or revoking approval pursuant to paragraph VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The department may issue reports outside of the regular approval process directing school districts or non-school district programs to take any of the actions set forth in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At the conclusion of the time limit specified for the school district, public agency, private provider of special education, or other non-school district based program to have completed the corrective action specified in the orders of compliance, the administrator of the bureau of special education of the department of education shall forward to the commissioner of the department of education a written report indicating the extent to which the agency took corrective action to achieve compliance with state and federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the event the written report shows that the school district, public agency, private provider of special education, or other non-school district based program has not complied with orders issued by the department, the commissioner of the department of education shall give the written notice of the enforcement action to be taken.
