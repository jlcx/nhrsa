I. School districts or school administrative units, or both, may enter into cooperative agreements in order to provide approved programs for educating children with disabilities.  The state board of education, when appropriate because of a low incidence of a disabling condition, high cost of services, or scarcity of trained personnel, shall encourage such cooperative agreements and shall serve as a source of information, advice and guidance to school districts, school administrative units, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state board of education, together with representatives of neighboring states, shall study the feasibility of interstate agreements for the provision of services to children with disabilities.
