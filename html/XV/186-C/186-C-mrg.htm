<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The division of educational improvement of the department of education, through its program approval and monitoring process shall determine if a district is making diligent efforts to resolve personnel shortages that result in children with disabilities being placed out of district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The purpose of program approval and monitoring is to ensure that the programs specified in paragraph I comply with applicable federal and state law, including standards related to improving educational results and functional outcomes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Program approval and monitoring shall utilize professionally recognized program evaluation and other verification methods to ensure reliable and valid findings and corrective actions.  The department shall develop and apply standards and procedures to determine whether each program specified in paragraph I complies with the requirements of applicable federal and state law.  Such standards shall give considerable weight to rigorous benchmarks or performance outcomes and indicators required by federal and state law most relevant to achieving educational results and functional outcomes.  Program approval and monitoring shall also include, but not be limited to the following components and processes:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The department shall make available sufficient funds for stipends or similar financial remuneration, in addition to expense reimbursements to ensure that teams have a diversity of perspectives and high quality professional membership.  The department of education may contract with an individual or organization which has the requisite expertise and skill to perform the monitoring activities, and who is otherwise independent from school district and non-school district programs in New Hampshire.  This subparagraph shall not be construed to preclude individuals who may have performed sporadic or occasional contract or volunteer work for school district or non-school district programs.

<center><h3>Section 186-C:23</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 186-C:23 Alternative Dispute Resolution. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In order to encourage informal resolution of differences of opinion regarding the provision of special education, the following methods of alternative dispute resolution shall be available to parents and school districts:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Neutral conference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Mediation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Facilitated individualized education program meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. To assist parents and schools, this subdivision requires the local education agency to notify the department of education in writing that an individualized education program, educational placement, identification, or evaluation of a child has been rejected by the parent, and establishes a 30-day period for discussion beginning on the date such notice is received by the department of education.  Immediately following notification, the department shall communicate to the parent a description of the alternative dispute resolution process.  While the use of these informal resolution procedures is strongly encouraged, it is not mandatory for either party.  If this option is chosen by both parties, the department shall, during the 30-day period, schedule and conduct an alternative dispute resolution conference.  The conference shall not be used to delay a due process hearing;  however, both parties may agree to postpone the hearing pending a resolution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Alternative dispute resolution proceedings shall be confidential and shall not impair the right of the participants to demand a due process hearing.  Information, evidence, or the admission of any party shall not be disclosed or used in any subsequent proceeding.  Statements made and documents prepared by a party, attorney, or other participant in aid of such proceeding shall be privileged and shall not be disclosed.  In addition, the parties shall not introduce into evidence in any subsequent proceeding the fact that there was an alternative dispute resolution proceeding or any other matter concerning the conduct of such proceedings.  The authority of the department of education in alternative dispute resolution proceedings initiated under this section shall be limited to the provisions of paragraphs I and II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. There shall be no record made of any alternative dispute resolution proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Evidence that would otherwise be admissible in a due process hearing or in a subsequent court hearing shall not be rendered inadmissible as a result of its use in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding.

<center><h3>Section 186-C:25</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 186-C:25 Medicaid to Schools Program Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established within the department of health and human services a Medicaid reimbursement program to be known as the "Medicaid to schools''  program providing medical assistance for covered services furnished to children with disabilities.  The purpose of the program is to seek Medicaid reimbursement for services provided by local school districts and school administrative units to children with disabilities which are reimbursable under federal law but which were previously fully funded by such districts or administrative units.  The program shall be voluntary and is designed to assist children with disabilities by maintaining them in their own homes and communities.  This subdivision is intended to provide Medicaid funding for services which, in the absence of such funding, nevertheless qualify as special education or related services under this chapter.  It is not the intention of this subdivision to increase school district responsibility or liability beyond what is required by other sections of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Eligible services may be provided to children with disabilities and may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Occupational and physical therapy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any other service which qualifies as a special education or related service under RSA 186-C or federal law and which also qualifies for reimbursement under Medicaid as a covered service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Services provided under this subdivision shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Offer the least restrictive setting for children receiving the services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Be provided to children in conformity with any medical criteria necessary for Medicaid reimbursement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Be in addition to any special education program as defined in the New Hampshire Rules for the Education of Children with Disabilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Be provided only after obtaining informed parental consent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner of the department of health and human services, after consultation with the commissioner of the department of education, shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) State plans and reimbursement procedures necessary for local school districts or school administrative units to receive appropriate Medicaid reimbursement for eligible services under paragraph II of this section that are provided or paid for by school districts or school administrative units.  Such rules shall recognize the financial obligation of the department of health and human services, and that any disputes between the department of health and human services and a school district or school administrative unit regarding whether such reimbursement is required shall be resolved pursuant to RSA 186-C:7-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Monitoring mechanisms to ensure that services provided under this subdivision meet the requirements of paragraph III of this section.  Monitoring responsibilities shall be consistent with the jurisdiction of the different departments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A financial mechanism by which the federal mandatory matching requirement is met through collection, or other means, of 50 percent of the cost of allowable services from local school districts and/or school administrative units.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner of the department of health and human services, after consultation with the commissioner of the department of education, shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to further defining services eligible for medicaid reimbursement under this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. New Hampshire local school districts or school administrative units shall be the enrolled Medicaid providers for the purpose of administration and billing.
