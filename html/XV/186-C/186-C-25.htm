&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 186-C:25 Medicaid to Schools Program Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established within the department of health and human services a Medicaid reimbursement program to be known as the "Medicaid to schools''  program providing medical assistance for covered services furnished to children with disabilities.  The purpose of the program is to seek Medicaid reimbursement for services provided by local school districts and school administrative units to children with disabilities which are reimbursable under federal law but which were previously fully funded by such districts or administrative units.  The program shall be voluntary and is designed to assist children with disabilities by maintaining them in their own homes and communities.  This subdivision is intended to provide Medicaid funding for services which, in the absence of such funding, nevertheless qualify as special education or related services under this chapter.  It is not the intention of this subdivision to increase school district responsibility or liability beyond what is required by other sections of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Eligible services may be provided to children with disabilities and may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Screening, evaluation, and diagnostic services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Speech pathology and audiology.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Occupational and physical therapy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any other service which qualifies as a special education or related service under RSA 186-C or federal law and which also qualifies for reimbursement under Medicaid as a covered service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Services provided under this subdivision shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Offer the least restrictive setting for children receiving the services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Be provided to children in conformity with any medical criteria necessary for Medicaid reimbursement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Be in addition to any special education program as defined in the New Hampshire Rules for the Education of Children with Disabilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Be provided only after obtaining informed parental consent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner of the department of health and human services, after consultation with the commissioner of the department of education, shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) State plans and reimbursement procedures necessary for local school districts or school administrative units to receive appropriate Medicaid reimbursement for eligible services under paragraph II of this section that are provided or paid for by school districts or school administrative units.  Such rules shall recognize the financial obligation of the department of health and human services, and that any disputes between the department of health and human services and a school district or school administrative unit regarding whether such reimbursement is required shall be resolved pursuant to RSA 186-C:7-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Monitoring mechanisms to ensure that services provided under this subdivision meet the requirements of paragraph III of this section.  Monitoring responsibilities shall be consistent with the jurisdiction of the different departments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A financial mechanism by which the federal mandatory matching requirement is met through collection, or other means, of 50 percent of the cost of allowable services from local school districts and/or school administrative units.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The commissioner of the department of health and human services, after consultation with the commissioner of the department of education, shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to further defining services eligible for medicaid reimbursement under this subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. New Hampshire local school districts or school administrative units shall be the enrolled Medicaid providers for the purpose of administration and billing.
