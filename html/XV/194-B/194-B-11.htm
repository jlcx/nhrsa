&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 194-B:11 Chartered Public Schools;  Funding. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Chartered public schools shall be funded as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) There shall be no tuition charge for any pupil attending a charter conversion school located in that pupil's resident district.  Funding limitations in this chapter shall not be applicable to charter conversion schools located in a pupil's resident district.  For a chartered public school authorized by the school district, the pupil's resident district shall pay to such school an amount equal to not less than 80 percent of that district's average cost per pupil as determined by the department of education using the most recent available data as reported by the district to the department.  For pupils resident in this state who attend full-time a chartered public school authorized by a school district other than the pupil's resident school district, the state shall pay tuition pursuant to RSA 198:40-a directly to the chartered public school for such pupil.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall alter or modify the funding of the Virtual Learning Academy Charter School.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2), for a chartered public school authorized by the state board of education pursuant to RSA 194-B:3-a, the state shall pay tuition pursuant to RSA 198:40-a, I, II, and II-a plus an additional grant of $2,036 for the Virtual Learning Academy Charter School and $3,036 for all other chartered public schools directly to the chartered public school for each pupil who is a resident of this state in attendance at such chartered public school.  Beginning July 1, 2017 and every biennium thereafter, the department of education shall adjust the per pupil amount of the additional grant based on the average change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Northeast Region, using the "services less medical care services'' special aggregate index, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor.  The state shall pay amounts required pursuant to RSA 198:40-a, III directly to the resident district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For an online chartered public school which receives its initial authorization to operate from the state board of education pursuant to RSA 194-B:3-a on or after July 1, 2013, the state shall pay tuition pursuant to RSA 198:40-a directly to the online chartered public school for each pupil who is a resident of this state in attendance at such chartered public school.  In this subparagraph, "online chartered public school'' means a chartered public school which provides the majority of its classes and instruction on the Internet.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner of the department of education shall calculate and distribute chartered public school tuition payments as set forth herein.  The first payment shall be 30 percent of the per pupil amount multiplied by the number of eligible pupils present on the first day of the current school year.  Such payment shall be made no later than 15 days after the department of education receives the attendance report.  The December 1 payment shall be 30 percent of the per pupil amount multiplied by the membership on November 1, and the March 1 payment shall be 30 percent of the per pupil amount multiplied by the membership on February 1.  To calculate the final payment, the commissioner of the department of education shall multiply the per pupil amount by the average daily membership in attendance for the full school year, and subtract the total amount of the first 3 payments made.  The remaining balance shall be the final payment.  Eligible chartered public schools shall report membership in accordance with RSA 189:1-d.  In this subparagraph, "membership'' shall be as defined in RSA 189:1-d, II.  Tuition amounts shall be prorated on a per diem basis for pupils attending a school for less than a full school year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The source of funds for payments under this section shall be moneys from the education trust fund established in RSA 198:39.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The commissioner of the department of education shall submit a report to the fiscal committee of the general court for each payment made in a fiscal year by the state to a chartered public school pursuant to subparagraph (c).  For each chartered public school, the report shall contain the name and address of the school, the amount of the payment, and the number of students currently enrolled at the school.  Each report shall be submitted no later than 30 days after the payment date specified in subparagraph (c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A school district lacking a meaningful basis to determine average expenditure per pupil may use statewide average figures as determined by the department of education for the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) In accordance with current department of education standards, the funding and educational decision-making process for children with disabilities attending a chartered public school shall be the responsibility of the resident district and shall retain all current options available to the parent and to the school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a child is enrolled by a parent in a charted public school, the local education agency of the child's resident district shall convene a meeting of the individualized education program (IEP) team and shall invite a representative of the chartered public school to that meeting.  At the meeting, the IEP team shall determine how to ensure the provision of a free and appropriate public education in accordance with the child's IEP.  The child's special education and related services shall be provided using any or all of the methods listed below starting with the least restrictive environment:

(6) If the child requires transportation to and/or from the chartered public school before, after, or during the school day in order to receive special education and related services as provided in the IEP, the child's resident district shall provide transportation for the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Consistent with section 5210(1) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and section 300.209 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, when a parent enrolls a child with a disability in a chartered public school, the child and the child's parents shall retain all rights under federal and state special education law, including the child's right to be provided with a free and appropriate public education, which includes all of the special education and related services included in the child's IEP.  The child's resident district shall have the responsibility, including financial responsibility, to ensure the provision of the special education and related services in the child's IEP, and the chartered public school shall cooperate with the child's resident district in the provision of the child's special education and related services.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

State funds shall be provided in addition to any other sums provided by the state.  Grants under this section shall be administered and determined by the state board of education which shall have the authority to develop a grant application, written procedures and criteria used to determine eligibility for grants, and procedures for the administration of grants by recipients, including reporting requirements.
