&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Appeals from a school board on the matter of nonrenewal of teacher contracts, providing that the appeal to the state board of education shall be limited to the record developed at the school board hearing, except where the state board of education determines that new evidence is available which could not have been reasonably discovered at the time of the school board hearing and that such evidence may have materially affected the outcome of the school board hearing.  In such cases, the state board of education shall render a final decision in the matter or remand it to the school board for a new hearing.
<br>
