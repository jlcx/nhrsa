(b) Encourage the use of public school facilities by various educational groups and organizations within the community, subject to those guidelines and policies which might be established by local school boards.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Extend control over adult or continuing education programs organized by public or private institutions of higher or postsecondary education to the state board of education, except where such programs are already under its jurisdiction.
