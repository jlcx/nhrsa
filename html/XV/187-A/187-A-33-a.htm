&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 187-A:33-a Company Default on Matching Funds. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In the event that a company defaults on all or a portion of its matching obligations, the state's obligated pro rata portion of the project costs incurred will still be paid to the university to minimize its losses for the work that has already been completed.  The university shall notify the state within 45 days of the time a company's matching portion payment has not been received when due.
