<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court finds that because of the importance of public higher education, elected officials should be aware of the activities and needs of the university system, exercising their responsibility for legislative oversight through (1) the consideration by the appropriate legislative committees of proposed legislation pertaining to the university system;  and (2) the consideration of reports filed by the university system pursuant to RSA 187-A:16 and 187-A:22.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court also recognizes the need to protect the institutions of the university system from inappropriate external influence which might threaten the academic freedom of faculty members or otherwise inhibit the pursuit of academic excellence.  To this end, the general court has delegated broad authority to the board of trustees who shall be responsible for managing the university system in a manner which promotes academic excellence and serves the educational needs of the people of New Hampshire.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Enter into agreements and contract with other colleges and universities for the purpose of further education of any qualified New Hampshire student in fields of study not provided for in the curricula of the university system or any of its divisions or component institutions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. Contract with any city or town in this state for the maintenance of practice schools therein in connection with its teacher-trainees and to provide for the payment of such portion of the compensation of the supervising teachers employed in said practice schools as it may deem just and equitable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Authorize the retention by Keene state college or Plymouth state university of the income received and due from all sources, including bequests, trusts, student fees and tuition charges, rents, sales and any other income from whatever source derived, and to authorize the use thereof in such manner as the trustees may determine or as may be provided by law or by the conditions incident to the trusts, gifts and bequests involved.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVI. Employ such other persons as may be necessary to carry out the purposes for which the university system and any of its divisions or component institutions have been created and to prescribe their duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVII. By and with the consent of the governor and council, borrow on the credit of the university system in anticipation of income, for the purpose of forwarding its building program, not exceeding $500,000 in any one fiscal year.  All amounts so obtained in any fiscal year shall be repaid from the income of the next succeeding fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XVIII. Establish a differential in the rate of tuition to be charged all in-state and out-of-state students based on the dual legislative policy of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Limiting the number of out-of-state students who may attend the university system;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Giving due weight to the fact that the support of the university system is substantially dependent upon legislative appropriations derived from revenue contributed by persons domiciled within the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIX. Adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A establishing criteria for determining whether students shall be classified as in-state students or out-of-state students for tuition purposes, and to delegate the administration of such rules to a subcommittee or agent.  Any student in the university system who is aggrieved by a final determination of the board of trustees or of any subcommittee or agent of the board denying in-state status for tuition purposes may appeal to the superior court in the county in which the particular division of the university involved is located.  Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the final determination by the board of trustees.  In the superior court, the burden of proof shall be on the appellant to show that the determination of the board of trustees is unreasonable or unlawful and all findings by the board or its properly designated subcommittee or agent shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable.  The determination of the board of trustees shall be set aside only if, on all the evidence, the court is satisfied that it is unlawful or unreasonable according to the policy as set forth in this section, and additional criteria as may be established and published, to the student bodies of the institutions constituting the university system by the board of trustees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XX. Enter into agreements with appropriate agencies and institutions of higher education in other states and foreign countries providing for the reciprocal exchange of students.  Such agreement may include provisions for waiver or reduction of out-of-state tuition rates for designated categories of students and may include contractual payments to such out-of-state institutions within the availability of appropriations.  The board shall have the power to make such agreements on a continuing basis with mutual credits and offsets which need not be balanced in any given year.  One purpose to be accomplished thereby shall be to make available to in-state students of the university system educational facilities not available within the state of New Hampshire in exchange for acceptance by the university system of out-of-state students from jurisdictions where such facilities are made available for New Hampshire students.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXI. Acquire all risk insurance to cover donated property, real and personal, and to cover the equipment of New Hampshire public television as may be essential to remain eligible for federal funding of public television, notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 9:27 to the contrary;  provided, however, that the costs of such insurance shall be borne by New Hampshire public television from private moneys and that no state funds shall be used for this purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXII. Maintain and operate all housing facilities, dining halls or other food service facilities, student unions, and bookstores for students and faculty on all campuses of the university system, and to collect rents from such facilities.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XXIII. Require every student admitted after December 31, 2012 and receiving the in-state rate of tuition to execute an affidavit attesting he or she is a legal resident of the United States.

<center><h3>Section 187-A:34</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 187-A:34 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court recognizes the numerous benefits to the state's economic base from the establishment of businesses by inventors and the numerous benefits provided by inventors which include industrial diversification, broadening of the economic base, a great proliferation of jobs, providing financial benefits to our citizens through a greatly expanded tax base, and new products and processes for the nation's consumers.  A great number of inventions are never authoritatively considered primarily because inventors are unfamiliar with the business environment or financial structure necessary for implementing their proposals.  The general court, therefore, recognizes a need to encourage and assist inventors and, at the same time, to position this state as a leader in advanced and high technology and to foster a climate for those leaders of this state, the nation and the world.
