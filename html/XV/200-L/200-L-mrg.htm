<codesect>
This contract is entered into and shall be in force in accordance with its terms and is between and among the following states party to the "Interstate Agreement on Qualification of Educational Personnel'' which have subscribed hereto as evidenced by an attached signature page properly executed by the appropriate officials of the states involved:  Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  In each instance, such a signature page shall specifically identify this contract in such manner as to make clear that the signatures thereon represent and constitute execution of this contract.  The states entering into this contract hereby covenant and agree as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 1. Consideration and Authority.  The consideration for this contract is the mutual implementation of the policy and purpose set forth in the interstate agreement on qualification of educational personnel and the benefits flowing therefrom as declared in the said interstate agreement.  The authority for the making of this contract is the interstate agreement on qualification of educational personnel, as enacted by each of the contracting states, and the applicable statutes of each such state in implementation of the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 2. Incorporation of Interstate Agreement and Definitions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) This contract is pursuant to and in implementation of the interstate agreement on qualification of educational personnel.  All provisions of that agreement shall govern, to the extent that they apply to the subject matter of this contract, whether or not such provisions are specifically set forth or referred to herein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) As used in this contract:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
1. "Designated state official'' means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his/her state, contracts pursuant to the interstate agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
2. "State'' means the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
3. "School support professional'' means any person other than a teacher or school administrator, as defined below, on either the state or local level who is required by law to hold a certificate/license based on the minimum of a baccalaureate degree in order to be employed in a professional capacity in a school system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
4. "School administrator'' means a school professional required by law to hold a certificate/license whose primary duties involve the development, supervision, or internal management of a school, school system or school program rather than the furnishing of direct instructional or other services to pupils.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
5. "Teacher'' means a school professional required by law to hold a certificate/license whose primary function is to provide instruction to students at the preschool or kindergarten level, or in any one or more grades from grade 1 to grade 12, inclusive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 3. Interstate Acceptance;  Northeast Regional Credential.  Any teacher, school administrator, or school support professional who holds an initial or advanced certificate/license issued by a state party to this contract, which certificate/license is still in force and which has been classified as comparable pursuant to Article 4 of this contract, shall be eligible for a northeast regional credential.  The northeast regional credential shall be issued upon request by the state which has issued the state certificate/license and in accordance with the administrative procedures and payment of fee established by unanimous agreement of the designated state officials.  Such credential will allow the individual to perform those professional duties allowed by the comparable state certificate/license in any school system within any state which is a party to this contract.  The northeast regional credential shall be valid for 24 months from the date of issuance and shall be non-renewable.  Each state may designate a period of time, not to exceed 24 months, during which an individual may be employed in that state while possessing a northeast regional credential.  No northeast regional credential issued pursuant to the terms of this contract shall be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 4. Comparability of Certificates/Licenses.  The designated state officials shall determine by unanimous agreement which certificates/licenses are comparable for the purposes of this contract.  Such determination of comparability is set forth in an appendix which is attached to and made a part of this contract.  The designated state officials or their representatives shall meet at least annually to consider whether the list of comparable certificates/licenses should be revised.  Any revisions shall be made by amendment to this contract as set forth in Article 7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 5. Suspension and Revocation.  Revocation or suspension of an individual's certificate/license imposed by the issuing state shall automatically result in the imposition of the same penalty with respect to the northeast regional credential held by that individual.  The state in which the individual is employed under the northeast regional credential may revoke or suspend the northeast regional credential on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate/license initially granted by that state and in accordance with its procedural due process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 6. Construction and Severability.  This contract shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this contract shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this contract is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any of the party states or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this contract shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the contract shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 7. Amendment of Contract.  In addition to those responsibilities in Article 4, the designated state officials or their representatives may evaluate the effectiveness of the northeast regional credential and may recommend amendments to this contract.  Any provisions of this contract may be amended upon unanimous agreement of the designated state officials.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Article 8. Term.  This contract shall be for a term to commence on April 1, 1990, and shall terminate on March 31, 1995.  It may be renewed for successive periods of 5 years.  Withdrawal, except withdrawal by failure to renew, may be on one year's written notice to the designated state officials and central state recordkeeping agencies of the other party states.
