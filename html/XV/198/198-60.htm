&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever the commissioner refuses to grant a claimant tax relief, or after an audit, assesses an amount against the claimant for property tax relief granted including interest and applicable penalties for an erroneously paid claim, the claimant may appeal in writing within 30 days of notice of such refusal or assessment to the board of tax and land appeals.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of tax and land appeals may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the decision appealed from when there is an error of law or when the board finds the commissioner's action to be arbitrary or unreasonable.
