&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 198:4-c Building Trades Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Any school district may appropriate money to establish a revolving fund to aid instruction in the building construction trades.  The fund shall be used to pay necessary costs of construction projects which are carried out as part of the instructional program, including the purchase of real estate.  No project shall be undertaken unless the fund contains enough money to cover the proposed budget.  When the building is completed it shall be sold and the money received put into the fund for use in another construction project.
