Such eligible districts shall receive, at their election, either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A construction grant to cover 75 percent of the actual cost of construction of kindergarten facilities, exclusive of site acquisition and core facilities;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A construction grant to cover 100 percent of the actual cost of the design and construction of a basic code compliant kindergarten facility, but shall not include site acquisition and core facilities.  In this subparagraph, "basic code compliant kindergarten facility'' means a new building or an addition to an existing building that the commissioner of the department of education determines satisfies the minimum standards for school approval for a kindergarten program and all applicable building code standards.  The commissioner shall establish specifications pursuant RSA 198:15-s, IV for such a basic code compliant facility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A school district that displaces pupils from an existing classroom space in order to use such space to provide a kindergarten program shall be eligible for a construction grant under subparagraphs I(a) or (b) to cover the costs incurred in constructing or renovating new classroom space for the displaced pupils.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Grants under subparagraphs I(a) or (b) shall also cover the cost of initial furniture, fixtures, and equipment needed to operate a kindergarten program.

VII. Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the inclusion of the site and related facilities that are not eligible for funding by the state under this subdivision as part of kindergarten construction costs from being included in a regular building aid funding request as provided in RSA 198:15-b.  However, no school district which receives any funding under this subdivision shall be eligible to receive school building aid under RSA 198:15-b for the same project.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Kindergarten facilities constructed under this subdivision shall be the property of the school district or the city maintaining a school department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. A district shall not be deemed ineligible from receiving the full amount of a construction or transition grant for which it is otherwise eligible as a result of the district already expending funds for construction or transition costs related to providing a kindergarten program beginning in the 2008-2009 or 2009-2010 school years.

I. The amount of the annual grant to any school district duly organized, any city maintaining a school department within its corporate organization, any cooperative school district as defined in RSA 195:1, or any receiving district operating an area school as defined in RSA 195-A:1, shall be determined as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Determine each municipality's equalized valuation per pupil by dividing the municipality's equalized valuation by the average daily membership in residence within each municipality.  Assign each municipality a rank beginning with the municipality having the lowest equalized valuation per pupil ranked as number one, and continuing therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Determine each municipality's median family income, and assign each municipality a rank beginning with the municipality having the lowest median family income ranked as number one and continuing therefrom.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Add the rankings assigned in subparagraphs I(a) and I(b) and divide the sum by 2 to yield the building aid factor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The amount of the annual grant in this subdivision shall be a sum equal to a percentage of the amount of the annual payment of principal on all outstanding borrowings of the school district, city, cooperative school district, joint maintenance agreement, or receiving district, for all approved costs of construction or purchase of school buildings and school administrative unit facilities, for grants approved on or before July 1, 2013 according to the following table:
<PRE>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A cooperative school district, receiving district operating an area school, or joint maintenance agreement grant amount shall be determined by calculating the percentage of the average daily membership in residence represented by each municipality which has entered into the agreement and multiplying this percentage by each municipality's percentage of annual building aid eligibility under paragraph II of this section.  This product shall be multiplied by the projected cost of the building project.  The sum of the resulting products shall be the annual building aid grant for the cooperative school district, area school, or joint maintenance agreement.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any school district at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing indefinitely, until specific rescission of such authority, the school board to apply for, accept and expend, without further action by the school district, unanticipated money from a state, federal or other governmental unit or a private source which becomes available during the fiscal year.  The following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Such warrant article to be voted on shall read:  "Shall the school district accept the provisions of RSA 198:20-b providing that any school district at an annual meeting may adopt an article authorizing indefinitely, until specific rescission of such authority, the school board to apply for, accept and expend, without further action by the school district, unanticipated money from a state, federal or other governmental unit or a private source which becomes available during the fiscal year?''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a majority of voters voting on the question vote in the affirmative, the proposed warrant article shall be in effect in accordance with the terms of the article until such time as the school district votes to rescind its vote.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such money shall be used only for legal purposes for which a school district may appropriate money.  No funds disbursed from the education trust fund pursuant to RSA 198:42 shall, under any circumstances, emergency or otherwise, be deemed to be unanticipated money under the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) For unanticipated funds in the amount of $5,000 or more, the school board shall hold a prior public hearing on the action to be taken.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The school district may at any annual or special meeting appropriate such sums of money as it deems necessary to create expendable trust funds for specific purposes for the maintenance and operation of schools and for any other public purpose that is not foreign to the school district's institution or incompatible with the objects of their organization.  The school board may be named agents to expend such trust funds.  Expenditure from such trust funds shall be made only for the purpose for which the trust fund was established.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. School district trust funds created pursuant to this section shall be held in custody by the trustee named pursuant to RSA 31:22 of trust funds of the town wherein the school district lies, or in the case of school districts embracing 2 or more towns, by the trustees of trust funds of that town which the voters of the school district may elect at the annual school district meeting.  In order to expend such funds, the school board shall hold a public hearing prior to the expenditure to be made.  Notice of the time, place, and subject of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the relevant municipality at least 7 days before the meeting is held.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A trust fund created under the provisions of this section that is established for the purpose of maintaining health insurance funds for the benefit of employees and retired employees of any school district, including an OPEB trust established pursuant to paragraph VII, shall be exempt from the provisions of paragraph II, and when so established, the school district may name its own trustees who may expend any funds in the trust for the payment of health claims or health insurance premiums for the benefit of any employees or retired employees of the school district.  An annual accounting and report of the activities of the trust shall be presented to the school board of the district and published in the annual report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Trust funds created pursuant to this section shall be revocable by majority vote of the legal voters present and voting at any annual meeting, unless the vote creating the trust expressly provides that the trust shall be irrevocable, and upon revocation the trustees of trust funds holding the account for said trust shall pay all the moneys in such funds to the school treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any trust fund created under this section shall be subject to the same provisions concerning custody, investment, expenditure, change of purpose and audit as are reserve funds established under RSA 35:1 or 35:1-c.  The legal validity of such a fund properly established shall not be affected by its designation as a "trust,'' "reserve,'' "capital reserve,'' or any other designation.  A trust fund established for maintaining health insurance funds as set forth in paragraph III shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 35:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The district may authorize the acceptance of privately-donated gifts, legacies and devises to be utilized for the same purpose as a trust fund created under this section;  provided, however, that such gifts, legacies or devises shall be invested and accounted for separately from, and not commingled with, amounts appropriated under paragraph I, and shall be subject to the custody and investment provisions applicable to trust funds accepted under RSA 31:31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) A school district that created, on or before January 1, 2012, an actuarial liability to pay other post-employment benefits (OPEB) to employees or officers after their termination of service may establish an irrevocable trust to pay those benefits.  In this paragraph, the term "other post-employment benefits'' means employee benefits other than pensions that are received after employment ends, and may include such medical, disability, or other health benefits, as are covered by Statement No. 45 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).  The term "trust'' means a trust qualified under GASB Statement No. 43.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Deposits to any fund under such a trust and any earnings on those deposits shall be irrevocable and shall be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of retirees and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the plans or programs providing other post-employment benefits, except that funds governed by the trust may be withdrawn for other purposes only when an employer's liability owed to former officers or employees for other post-employment benefits has been satisfied or otherwise eliminated pursuant to subparagraph (d)(2).  The assets of any trust created pursuant to this paragraph or in which a school district participates pursuant to this paragraph shall be exempt from taxation and execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other process.  No public officer, employee, or agency shall divert, use, or authorize the use of such funds for any purpose other than as provided in law for other post-employment benefits covered by the trust and administrative expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The trustees of any trust created pursuant to this paragraph shall have the full power to invest, reinvest, and manage the assets of the trust.  The trustees shall invest the assets of the trust with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.  The trustees shall also diversify such investments so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.  The trustees may engage a trust administrator, investment consultants, or other qualified professionals to assist with management and investment of the funds of the trust and may pay for these services out of the funds of the trust.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The school district may withdraw money from the funds of a trust created pursuant to this paragraph only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) As needed to pay other post-employment benefits owed to former officers and employees;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) When all other post-employment benefits liability owed to former officers or employees of the employing entity has been satisfied or otherwise defeased.
