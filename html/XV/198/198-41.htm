(b) Subtract the amount of the education tax warrant to be issued by the commissioner of revenue administration for such municipality reported pursuant to RSA 76:8 for the next tax year.

II. For municipalities where all school districts therein provide education to all of their pupils by paying tuition to other institutions, the department of education shall determine the total education grant for each municipality as the lesser of the 2 following calculations:

(b) For each fiscal year from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2016, the department of education shall not distribute a total education grant on behalf of all pupils who reside in a municipality that exceeds 108 percent of the total education grant distributed to such municipality in the previous fiscal year.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the department of education shall not distribute a total education grant on behalf of all pupils who reside in a municipality that exceeds 160 percent of the total education grant distributed to such municipality in the previous fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) For fiscal year 2012, the department of education shall identify all municipalities in which the fiscal year 2012 total education grant will be less than the fiscal year 2011 total education grant.  The department shall distribute a stabilization grant to each of those municipalities equal to 100 percent of the decrease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For fiscal year 2013, the department of education shall identify all municipalities in which the fiscal year 2013 total education grant, including any stabilization grant distributed pursuant to subparagraph (a), will be less than the fiscal year 2011 total education grant.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, the department of education shall distribute a total education grant to each municipality in an amount equal to the total education grant for the fiscal year in which the grant is calculated plus the amount of the fiscal year 2012 stabilization grant, if any, distributed to the municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter, the department of education shall distribute a total education grant to each municipality in an amount equal to the total education grant for the fiscal year in which the grant is calculated plus a percentage of the municipality's fiscal year 2012 stabilization grant, if any, distributed to the municipality;  the percentage shall be 96 percent for fiscal year 2017, and shall be reduced by 4 percent of the amount of the 2012 education grant for each fiscal year thereafter.  No stabilization grant shall be distributed to any municipality for any fiscal year in which the municipality's education property tax revenue collected pursuant to RSA 76 exceeds the total cost of an adequate education or to any municipality for any fiscal year in which the municipality's ADMA is zero.

VII. When final determination year data is available, but not later than April 1, the department shall make a final determination of grant amounts.  A municipality's grant estimate shall not be less than 95 percent of the estimate reported pursuant to paragraph V.  The department shall adjust the April grant disbursement required pursuant to RSA 198:42 so that the total amount disbursed for the fiscal year shall match the final grant determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII.
