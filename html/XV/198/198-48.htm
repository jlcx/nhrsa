<codesect>
Distributions under RSA 198:42 are based on adequate education costs determined in RSA 198:41 and are independent of how the municipalities decide to spend the distributions or other funds they may raise for education.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing in this subdivision is intended in any way to limit or control how school districts operate or spend their budgets except that adequate education grants must be expended for educational purposes.  Adequate education grants shall not be considered unanticipated funds under RSA 198:20-b.
