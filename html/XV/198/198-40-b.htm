&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A school district which receives differentiated aid under RSA 198:40-a, I(b)-(e) for schools within its jurisdiction, shall separately account for such aid as part of its financial accounting procedures.  Differentiated aid shall only be used to provide enhanced programs in schools within its jurisdiction for which such aid has been allocated that are known to improve pupil achievement, including but not limited to:  pre-kindergarten programs, full-day kindergarten programs, extended learning time, professional development opportunities for teachers, hiring of additional instructional and non-instructional personnel, programs designed to reduce class size, parental involvement programs, additional technology resources, drop out prevention programs, principal incentive programs, and curriculum enrichment programs.  The school district shall determine which programs are most needed and most appropriate for their pupils.  The department shall annually review and update the list of approved programs from which a school district may choose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A school district which receives differentiated aid under RSA 198:40-a, I(b)-(e) for use in schools within its jurisdiction shall annually submit a report to the commissioner documenting for each school within its jurisdiction for which such aid has been allocated, the enhanced programs selected for implementation, an explanation of the specific educational needs which the program is intended to address, an explanation of how the program will be implemented in the school, and an estimate of the cost of implementing the program.  The commissioner shall review these reports to ensure that differentiated aid will be used to provide programs approved under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A school district which receives differentiated aid for schools within its jurisdiction pursuant to RSA 198:40-a, I-III shall direct such aid to the schools for which such aid was calculated.  A school district which receives differentiated aid for pupils that attend schools in another school district, shall direct such aid to the school district where its pupils are being educated.  Any differentiated aid directed from one school district to another pursuant to this paragraph shall be a credit against any existing financial liability between the school districts.
