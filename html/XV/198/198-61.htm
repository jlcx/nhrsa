&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 198:61 Refund of Tax Claims. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The department of revenue administration shall review a claim for tax relief filed with it and, if such claim is determined to be valid, shall certify such amount to the state treasurer within 120 days who shall pay such claims from funds in the education trust fund.  Such sums are hereby appropriated and the governor is authorized to draw a warrant from the education trust fund to satisfy the state's obligation under this section.  Such warrant for payment shall be issued regardless of the balance of funds available in the education trust fund.  If the balance in the education trust fund, after the issuance of any such warrant, is less than zero, the commissioner of the department of revenue administration shall inform the fiscal committee and the governor and council of such balance.  This reporting shall not in any way prohibit or delay the payment of valid claims.  The department shall notify a claimant whose claim is rejected in whole or in part of such determination within 90 days of the department's receipt of the claim and all required documentation.
