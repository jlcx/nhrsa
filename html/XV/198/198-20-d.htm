<codesect>
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a school district or a city with a dependent school district may incur debt in anticipation of reimbursement under RSA 186-C:18 and under RSA 198:42.  The governing body, after notice and public hearing, may elect to borrow such funds and to recognize the proceeds of the borrowing as revenue for property tax rate setting purposes by providing written notification to the commissioner of the department of revenue administration stating the specific amount of borrowing to be recognized as revenue.  Any borrowing under this section shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 33, relative to debt limits.
