<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The adequate education grant determined in RSA 198:41 shall be distributed to each municipality's school district or districts from the education trust fund in 4 payments of 20 percent on September 1, 20 percent on November 1, 30 percent on January 1, and 30 percent on April 1 of each school year;  provided that for a dependent school district, the grant determined in RSA 198:41 shall be distributed to the municipality, which shall appropriate and transfer the grant funds to its dependent school department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2005, and every fiscal year thereafter, the amount necessary to fund the grants under RSA 198:41 is hereby appropriated to the department from the education trust fund created under RSA 198:39.  The governor is authorized to draw a warrant from the education trust fund to satisfy the state's obligation under this section.  Such warrant for payment shall be issued regardless of the balance of funds available in the education trust fund.  If the balance in the education trust fund, after the issuance of any such warrant, is less than zero, the commissioner of the department of administrative services shall inform the fiscal committee and the governor and council of such balance.  This reporting shall not in any way prohibit or delay the distribution of adequate education grants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department of education shall certify the amount of each grant to the state treasurer and direct the payment thereof to the school district or municipality.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For chartered public schools approved by the state board of education, the department of education may expend budgeted amounts to fund chartered public school payments under RSA 194-B:11, I.  Said amounts are hereby appropriated to the department from the education trust fund established under RSA 198:39.  The education trust fund shall be used to satisfy the state's obligation under this paragraph.  The payment shall be issued regardless of the balance of funds available in the education trust fund.  The department of education may request additional funds from the fiscal committee of the general court, with the approval of governor and council, for a new chartered public school approved for initial operation by the state board of education pursuant to RSA 194-B:3-a.
