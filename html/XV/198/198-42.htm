&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 198:42 Distribution Schedule of Adequate Education Grants;  Appropriation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The adequate education grant determined in RSA 198:41 shall be distributed to each municipality's school district or districts legally responsible for the education of the pupils who attend approved public schools within the district or in other districts or who attend approved programs for children with disabilities, as the case may be, from the education trust fund in 4 payments of 20 percent on September 1, 20 percent on November 1, 30 percent on January 1, and 30 percent on April 1 of each school year;  provided that for a dependent school district, the grant determined in RSA 198:41 shall be distributed to the municipality, which shall appropriate and transfer the grant funds to its dependent school department.  During the course of the school year, the commissioner may make adjustments in grant payments necessitated by variations in the ADMA data for a school district for any fiscal year in which the ADMA calculation is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2005, and every fiscal year thereafter, the amount necessary to fund the grants under RSA 198:41 is hereby appropriated to the department from the education trust fund created under RSA 198:39.  The governor is authorized to draw a warrant from the education trust fund to satisfy the state's obligation under this section.  Such warrant for payment shall be issued regardless of the balance of funds available in the education trust fund.  If the balance in the education trust fund, after the issuance of any such warrant, is less than zero, the commissioner of the department of administrative services shall inform the fiscal committee and the governor and council of such balance.  This reporting shall not in any way prohibit or delay the distribution of adequate education grants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department of education shall certify the amount of each grant to the state treasurer and direct the payment thereof to the school district.  When a payment of a grant is made to a school district, the municipality on whose behalf the payment is made shall receive notification from the state treasurer of the amount of the payment made to its school district or districts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For the fiscal year-beginning July 1, 2011, and every fiscal year thereafter, the department of education may expend funds up to 110 percent of budgeted amounts as necessary to fund chartered public school tuition payments under RSA 194-B:11, I.  Said amounts are hereby appropriated to the department from the education trust fund established under RSA 198:39.  The education trust fund shall be used to satisfy the state's obligation under this paragraph.  The payment shall be issued regardless of the balance of funds available in the education trust fund.  In the event that chartered public school tuition payments exceed budgeted amounts by over 10 percent, the department of education may expend funds in excess of said amounts, with the approval of the fiscal committee of the general court and governor and council.  Said funds shall be paid from the education trust fund established under RSA 198:39 upon the warrant of the governor out of any money in the fund not otherwise appropriated.
