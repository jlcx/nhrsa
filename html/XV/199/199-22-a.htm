I. Any school board may operate or allow to be operated for the benefit of persons age 60 or over a meal program on school property including the use of school equipment.  Such program may be operated on a profit basis and any surplus funds may be used to defray expenses or otherwise as the school board shall direct.  Provided that such program shall be operated at no expense to the district and shall not interfere with the education of the students.  The price charged for any meal may be based on the recipient's ability to pay as determined by the school board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The use in such program of food service equipment, food, and other items which are restricted in use to the benefit of the students is not authorized by this section unless such program is granted the permission upon such conditions as the restricting federal or state authority deems necessary.  In addition to any such conditions, the school board shall maintain such records as will accurately reflect the percentage of use of school property, school food service equipment, food, and other such restricted items between the geriatric program and the child nutrition program.  Further, insofar as practicable, grants in aid for replacement and original equipment shall be requested on the basis of the percentage of use from both available child nutrition funds and from available geriatric program grants.
