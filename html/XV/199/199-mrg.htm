<codesect>
The district may decide upon the location of its schoolhouses by vote or by a committee appointed for the purpose, provided, however, that all plans, specifications, and the selection of site for any new school buildings for any school district within the state shall be approved by the school board of the district in which it is proposed to construct such a building.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all new construction and substantial renovation of public school buildings, including those constructed by grant or loans of funds from state, the federal government, or other sources.  The district shall investigate feasible options in the course of deciding to renovate or replace an existing school building.  In considering such options, the district shall hold at least one public hearing and shall seek input from municipal boards and departments.  The district shall also review the municipality's zoning regulations and master plan in order to maximize best planning practices.  For the purposes of this chapter, in addition to their usual meanings, the words "schoolhouse'' and "school building'' also mean educational administration building, including school administrative unit facilities.
