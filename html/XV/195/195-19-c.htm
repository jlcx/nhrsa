&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:19-c Special Provisions for Cooperative School Districts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At the organizational meeting of the cooperative school district, the checklists for each pre-existing district shall be used.  The school board of any pre-existing district which does not have a checklist shall make a list of the legal voters in the district for use at such meeting as supervisors are required to do in towns as provided in RSA 654:25-654:31.  Thereafter, the cooperative school board shall make, correct and post a list of the legal voters of the cooperative school district acting as supervisors are required to do;  except that such list shall indicate with respect to each voter the pre-existing district in which he is domiciled.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, whenever each of the pre-existing school districts is coextensive with the town in which it is located, the cooperative school district may, at an annual cooperative school district meeting, under an article in the warrant for such meeting, vote that the supervisors of each town, acting as the supervisors of the cooperative school district, shall make, correct and post in each pre-existing district a checklist of the voters in each pre-existing district and shall certify to the same acting as supervisors of the cooperative school district and shall attend the cooperative school district meeting.  At each cooperative school district election, the checklists prepared by the supervisors in each pre-existing district in accordance with this section shall be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An updated checklist shall be used at all cooperative school district elections and meetings for the same purposes as checklists are used by towns as provided in RSA 669:5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any registered voter on a town or city checklist, who has his domicile within a cooperative school district, shall be eligible to vote at any cooperative school district election or meeting in the district where he has his domicile.  The supervisors of the checklists for the various cities and towns within a cooperative school district shall make an appropriate notation on their respective checklists with respect to which school district a registered voter is entitled to vote in.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any cooperative school district, which uses the checklists of the cities and towns within the district for an election or meeting pursuant to paragraph III, shall not be required to maintain a separate school district checklist or conduct sessions of the supervisors of the checklist.
