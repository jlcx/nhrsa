Thereafter all cooperative school district officers shall assume office at the close of the annual meeting.  The cooperative school board shall have the same powers and duties as school boards in school districts as prescribed by RSA 189.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Treasurer.  The treasurer of a cooperative school district shall be appointed by the cooperative school board for one or more terms not to exceed 5 years each, shall not be a member of the cooperative school board, and shall receive for services such sum as the cooperative school board may determine.
