&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:28 Disposition of Property. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If a pre-existing school district withdraws from the cooperative school district, the cooperative school district shall transfer and convey title to any school building and land located in the withdrawing district to the withdrawing district upon payment by the withdrawing district of the costs of capital improvements and additions to said school building incurred by the cooperative school district, less the share which the withdrawing school district has already paid toward such costs and the share which the withdrawing school district is required to contribute toward such costs as provided in RSA 195:27.  The amount of said capital improvements and additions and the time of transfer of title shall be determined by the agreement for withdrawal between the cooperative school district and the withdrawing school district.  The withdrawing school district forfeits its equity in all other cooperative school district facilities.
