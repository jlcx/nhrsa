&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:25 Procedure for Withdrawal. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
After the tenth anniversary of the date of operating responsibility, the school board of a cooperative school district may undertake a study of the feasibility and suitability of the withdrawal of one or more member districts from the cooperative district.  A similar study shall be undertaken if, after the tenth anniversary of the date of operating responsibility, a pre-existing district shall, by a majority vote on a warrant article at a regular or special town meeting, direct the school board to conduct such a study.  The study shall be conducted by a committee composed of at least one member of the school board from each of the pre-existing districts, one member of the board of selectmen from each town, and such other members as may be appointed by the committee.  Within 180 days after the date of its formation, the committee shall report its findings to the state board of education.  The committee shall submit to the state board of education either a report that withdrawal is not feasible or suitable, or a report that includes a withdrawal plan prepared in accordance with RSA 195:26.  If the committee determines that withdrawal is not feasible or suitable, the town which voted to undertake the study may submit a minority report at the same time as the committee report is filed with the state board of education.  If the committee report does not include a withdrawal plan, the minority report may include a withdrawal plan prepared in accordance RSA 195:26.  If the state board approves a withdrawal plan, whether submitted by the committee or by minority report, the plan shall be submitted to the voters of the cooperative school district in accordance with RSA 195:29.
