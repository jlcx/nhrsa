&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:4 Powers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. During the period from the date of the vote of the organization of any cooperative school district organized prior to July 1, 1963, to the date of operating responsibility such cooperative school district shall have all the authority and privileges of a regular school district for bonding purposes, for the construction of school facilities and for all other necessary functions to obtain proper facilities for the provision of a complete program of education.  When necessary the school board of the cooperative school district is authorized to prepare a budget and call a special meeting of the voters of the district for the purpose of adopting the budget and to determine the financial appropriations.  Such meeting shall have the same authority as an annual meeting for these purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Election of Officers.  Every such school district may, as provided in RSA 195:19, adopt a bylaw to specify the number, composition, method of selection, and terms of office of its cooperative school board;  provided that its cooperative school board shall consist of an odd number of members, not more than 15 for terms not exceeding 3 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Checklists.  At the meetings held in the preexisting districts for the purpose of accepting the articles of agreement, or any existing arrangements, and at the organization meeting of the cooperative school district the checklist for each preexisting district shall be used.  The school board of any preexisting district which does not have a checklist shall make, post, and correct a list of the voters in the district for use at such meetings as supervisors are required to do in regard to the list of voters in their towns.  Thereafter the cooperative school board shall make, post, and correct a list of the voters of the cooperative school district acting as supervisors are required to do, except that such list shall indicate with respect to each voter the preexisting district in which the voter is domiciled.  Any 2 members of the cooperative school board shall constitute a quorum at sessions for the correction of the checklist.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions whenever each of the preexisting school districts is coextensive with the town in which it is located the cooperative school district may, at an annual cooperative school district meeting, under an article in the warrant for such meeting, vote that the supervisors of each town, acting as the supervisors of the cooperative school district, shall make, post and correct in each preexisting district a checklist of the voters in each preexisting district and shall certify the making, posting, and correction of the checklist acting as supervisors of the cooperative school district.  At each annual meeting for the election of officers of the cooperative district the checklists prepared by the supervisors in each preexisting district in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall be used and the town supervisors from each preexisting district shall attend such annual meeting.  The voters of the cooperative district shall be those whose names appear on the checklists as provided by this paragraph.  The supervisors shall be paid such compensation as the district may provide.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. For purposes of state-wide supervision a cooperative school district shall be a school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The members of the cooperative school board shall serve with or without remuneration as the district shall determine, but they shall be paid their necessary expenses while upon official business.

The cooperative school board elected at the organization meeting shall organize and take office at the close of such meeting and proceed to assume its responsibilities and duties with respect to the administration and planning of the new cooperative school district;  provided, however, that the cooperative board shall have no administrative authority as to the schools in the pre-existing districts until the date of operating responsibility.  Thereafter all cooperative school district officers shall assume office at the close of the annual meeting.  The cooperative school board shall have the same powers and duties as school boards in school districts as prescribed by RSA 189.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:6 Powers and Duties of Cooperative School Districts. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Each cooperative school district shall be a body corporate and politic with power to sue and be sued, to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property for the use of schools therein, and to make necessary contracts in relation thereto, and have and possess all the powers and be subject to all the liabilities conferred and imposed upon school districts under the provisions of RSA 194.  Whenever a cooperative school district assumes all the functions of a pre-existing district, it shall also assume the outstanding indebtedness and obligations thereof as of the date of operating responsibility;  and on such date of operating responsibility the pre-existing districts shall be deemed dissolved, and any and all assets, property and records thereof not previously disposed of shall vest in the cooperative school district, unless otherwise provided in the articles of agreement or existing arrangements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Each cooperative school district shall have the power to borrow money and issue its notes or bonds in conformity with the provisions of RSA 33, provided, however, indebtedness of a cooperative district organized to provide both elementary and secondary schools may be incurred to an amount not to exceed 10 percent of its assessed valuation as last equalized by the commissioner of revenue administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever only a part of the educational facilities of a local school district are incorporated into a cooperative school district, such local district shall continue in existence and function as previously.  The cooperative school district shall assume only those outstanding debts and obligations of the local school district which pertain to the property acquired by the cooperative school district for use by the cooperative school district.  In such case no cooperative school district shall for elementary school purposes incur debt to an amount exceeding 5 percent, and for secondary school purposes, if organized for grades 9 through 12, to an amount exceeding 5 percent, and for secondary school purposes if organized for grades 7 through 12, to an amount not exceeding 6 percent of the total assessed valuation of such district as last equalized by the commissioner of revenue administration.  No cooperative school district described in this paragraph shall incur indebtedness if it subjects the taxable property of any school district forming a part thereof to debt, when added to the debt of such school district, of more than 10 percent of the total assessed value of such taxable property as last equalized by the commissioner of revenue administration.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) One-half of all such costs shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratio that the equalized valuation of each preexisting district bears to that of the cooperative district and  1/2 shall be apportioned on the average daily membership for the preceding year.
<br>

If a cooperative school district was organized prior to July 1, 1963, the basis for the apportionment of all such costs may be subject to review, pursuant to an article for that purpose duly inserted in the warrant for a district meeting to be held at any time after the expiration of the 5-year period measured from the date of the first annual meeting.  If the apportionment formula for a cooperative school district has been duly changed, the basis for the apportionment of all such costs may be subject to review, pursuant to an article for that purpose duly inserted in the warrant for a district meeting to be held at any time after the expiration of the 5-year period measured from the date of the meeting at which the last change was made to the cost apportionment formula.  In either case, the cooperative school district may then by majority vote elect to apportion all such costs by the adoption of one of the formulas set forth in RSA 195:7, I(a), (b), or (c).  Such apportionment may be reviewed in the same manner at any time in order to permit the enlargement of the territory of a school district or an increase in the number of grades for which the district shall be responsible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:9 Taking Over Property. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever a cooperative school district planning board is formed and it is proposed that a cooperative school district is to be established, the properties belonging to the districts that are to be used by the cooperative district shall be separately appraised by a committee to consist of 3 persons.  The commissioner of education shall designate one person on the committee, and the commissioner of revenue administration shall designate 2 persons, one of whom shall be a member of or a qualified appraiser employed by the department of revenue administration.  A member who is not in the employ of the state shall be paid $25 per day plus actual expenses in the performance of such member's duties.  A member who is in the employ of the state shall not be paid extra compensation other than the state salary, but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses in the performance of such member's duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. All expenses incurred in conducting an appraisal by the persons designated by the commissioner of revenue administration including the salaries and expenses of state employees, shall be paid in the first instance from the appropriation for the department of revenue administration.  Likewise, the salary and expenses incurred by the person designated by the commissioner of education, including the salaries and expenses of state employees, shall be paid in the first instance from the appropriation for the department of education.  The commissioner of revenue administration and the commissioner of education shall report the amount of money paid by them for the appraisal to the cooperative school district planning board.  The planning board shall reimburse the department of revenue administration and the department of education for these expenses.  If the planning board does not have sufficient funds to make reimbursement, it shall apportion the expenses among the several districts requesting the appraisal.  The reimbursements shall be credited to the appropriations for the department of revenue administration and the department of education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The decision of the committee with respect to the appraisal shall be final.  Unless otherwise provided in the articles of agreement, at the next annual assessment a tax equivalent to the total appraised value of the property to be used by the cooperative district shall be levied upon the several districts comprising the cooperative school district in the proportion that the equalized valuation of each bears to the equalized valuation of the whole and there shall be remitted to the taxpayers of each pre-existing district the appraised value of its property.  Whenever the cooperative school board decides the foregoing adjustment will work a hardship on any one or all of the pre-existing districts, it may, of its own motion, or upon petition of any of the residents of a pre-existing district provide that such adjustment be made over a period of not exceeding 20 years.

(a) The cooperative school board shall annually within 20 days of the close of the meeting certify to the commissioner of revenue administration and the state department of education, upon blanks prescribed and provided by the commissioner of revenue administration for the purpose, a certificate of the several appropriations voted by the district and estimated revenues, so far as known, and such other information as the commissioner of revenue administration may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner of revenue administration shall examine such certificates and delete any appropriations which appear not made in accordance with the law, and adjust any sum, in accordance with RSA 21-J:35, which may be used as a setoff against the amount appropriated when it appears to the commissioner of revenue administration such adjustment is in the best public interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The commissioner of revenue administration shall certify to the state department of education the amount to be apportioned among the pre-existing school districts.  This amount shall be the balance before the adequate education grant revenues are applied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Unless the provisions of RSA 195:14-a are adopted, the state department of education shall determine each municipality's proportional share of the net appropriation after application of the grants as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) First, the department shall determine each pre-existing district's proportional share of the amount to be apportioned based on the cooperative school district formula.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Second, the department shall then deduct each pre-existing school district's adequate education grant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the resulting amount is less than zero, the department shall reduce the adequate education grant under RSA 198:41 by the difference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The department shall notify the commissioner of the department of revenue administration of its determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Upon certification by the commissioner of revenue administration, the selectmen of each town shall seasonably assess the taxes as provided by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The selectmen shall pay over to the treasurer of the cooperative district such portions of the sums so raised as may reasonably be required according to a schedule of payments needed for the year as prepared by the treasurer and approved by the cooperative school board, but no such payment shall be greater in percentage to the total sum to be raised by one local district than that of any other local district comprising such cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Non-voted Appropriations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whenever a cooperative school district assumes any obligations of a preexisting district the cooperative school board shall also certify to the commissioner of revenue administration and the state department of education the amount to be raised by taxation to pay such obligations as they become due, and the state department of education shall determine the proportional part thereof to be borne by each preexisting district and notify the commissioner of revenue administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The commissioner of revenue administration shall then add the amount determined under subparagraph (a) to the other sums to be raised by said pre-existing districts and include the same in computing the rate percent of taxation for each pre-existing district, unless the articles of agreement or existing arrangement provides otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whenever a cooperative school district has assumed the obligations of a preexisting district, the amount of each payment of principal and interest on all obligations which have been thus assumed shall be annually assessed and collected without any vote or other act of approval whatsoever.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The adequate education grant used in subparagraph I(d) shall be based on the revised estimated revenues contained in the report required in RSA 198:4-d, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the commissioner finds that the actual adequacy grant used in the prior year was inaccurate or inappropriate, the commissioner shall perform a town-specific reconciliation adjustment for each town's estimates in question against the apportionment.  The difference between the recomputed apportionment and the apportionment determined under subparagraph (a), and the difference between the actual adequate education grant provided under RSA 198:42 for the prior year and the grant amount estimated in the prior year under subparagraph (a), shall be the basis for the town-specific reconciliation adjustment.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As an alternative to the apportionment of operating costs set forth in RSA 195:14, the cooperative school board may fix a specific percentage of the state adequate education grant amount received in a given year to be applied to the operating costs of the cooperative school district, before the apportionment of remaining cooperative school district operating costs.  Such percentage shall not be less than zero percent and not more than 100 percent and shall be the same in each city or town in the cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The question on the adoption of an alternative method of apportioning operating costs shall be proposed as an article in the warrant of the next cooperative school district annual or special meeting pursuant to RSA 195:13.  A majority of voters present and voting on the question in each city or town in the cooperative school district shall be required to approve the alternative method of apportioning operating costs.  Upon approval, the clerk of the cooperative school district shall send to the state board of education a certified copy of the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The procedure for modification or rescission of an alternative method of apportioning operating costs shall be as set forth in the alternative method of apportioning operating costs and shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 195:18, III(i).  A majority of voters present and voting on the question in each city or town in the cooperative school district shall be required to approve the modification or rescission.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:16 Enlargement of Territory. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A cooperative school district organized prior to July 1, 1963 may be enlarged in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The school board of any school district situated in proximity to an existing cooperative school district may petition the cooperative school board to meet with it to study jointly the advisability and the terms of enlarging the cooperative school district to include such district.  It shall thereupon be the duty of the cooperative school board to meet with the other school board as requested and engage in such joint study.  After such joint study the 2 school boards may recommend that the cooperative school district be so enlarged, and if they so recommend, they shall submit proposed articles of agreement in writing signed by a majority of each board setting forth in detail:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The date of operating responsibility, when the cooperative district shall assume control of operation of schools within the joining school district, upon which date the joining school district shall cease to exist;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The number, composition, method of selection and terms of office of its cooperative school board, all in accordance with the provisions of RSA 195:19 through 23 inclusive, provided that its cooperative school board shall consist of an odd number of members not more than 15 for terms not exceeding 3 years;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The specific school properties and other assets in the district to be acquired by the cooperative school district and the disposition of those not acquired including the records;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The initial location of the school or schools which will serve the joining school district;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The indebtedness of the joining school district which the cooperative school district is to assume;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The method of apportioning the capital outlay costs and operational costs under RSA 195:7 or under the articles of agreement of the cooperative school district, which method may be different from the formula previously adopted by the cooperative school district notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 195:8 or its articles of agreement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The manner in which state aid referred to in RSA 195:15 or any other available state aid shall be allocated, unless otherwise expressly provided by law;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Provisions similar to those outlined in RSA 195:18, IV, if desirable;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Any other matters, not incompatible with law, which the 2 school boards may consider appropriate to include in the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An executed copy of such proposed articles of agreement shall be submitted to the board;  and if it finds that the proposed enlargement would be in accord with the standards set forth in RSA 195:2 and approves the agreement, it shall cause the agreement to be submitted to the cooperative school district and to the joining school district for acceptance by each.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The cooperative school board and the school board of the joining school district, upon receipt of written notice of such approval by the board, shall cause the agreement to be filed with their respective district clerks and submitted to the voters of their respective districts as soon as may reasonably be possible at duly called meetings, the voting to be by ballot with the use of the checklist, after reasonable opportunity for debate in open meeting.  The article in the warrant and the question on the ballot shall be in substantially the following form:
<blockquote>
"Shall the proposed agreement on file with the district clerk, joining __________ school district to __________ cooperative school district be approved?''
</blockQuote>
<PRE>
 Yes _________ No _________

<br>
If a majority of the voters present and voting at such meetings in each district shall vote in the affirmative, the clerk of each district shall forthwith send to the board a certified copy of the warrant, certificate of posting, evidence of publication, if required, and minutes of meeting.  If the board finds that a majority of the voters present and voting in each district meeting have voted in favor of the enlargement, it shall issue its certificate to that effect, and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the lawful enlargement of the cooperative school district.  Articles of agreement so adopted shall be deemed to amend the inconsistent provisions in any pre-existing articles of agreement of the cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. Within 60 days after the board has issued its certificate of the lawful enlargement of the cooperative school district, the board shall fix a time and place for a special meeting of the qualified voters within the districts, and shall prepare the warrant for the meeting after consultation with school boards of the pre-existing school district and cooperative school district.  The warrant shall include articles for the selection of such school board members as may be necessary as a result of the enlargement and other items of business that require action under the terms of the articles of agreement.  The warrant shall be under the hand of the commissioner, in the name of the board, and the commissioner shall cause attested copies of same to be posted at least 14 days before the meeting in 3 public places in each district and a copy of the same to be published at least one week before the date of the meeting in some newspaper generally circulated within the cooperative school district.  The expense of posting and publishing the warrant shall be paid by the state.  The agent or agents of the commissioner who post and cause publication of the warrant shall make a return thereof, which, with the warrant, shall be made a part of the district records.  The meeting shall be called to order by the moderator of the cooperative school district.  This meeting shall have the same power and authority as an annual meeting with reference to the raising or appropriating of money.  At this meeting and at all future special and annual meetings, qualified voters of the joining district are eligible for participation in all matters of the cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Except for operating responsibility with respect to the schools in the joining district, which authority shall commence on the date specified in the articles of agreement, the cooperative school district and its school board shall have full powers and duties in the enlarged district from the date of the certificate of enlargement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The failure of the voters to approve the acquisition of a school district shall not prevent the commencement of enlargement proceedings under this section with respect to such district thereafter.

<center><h3>Section 195:18</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:18 Procedure for Formation of Cooperative School District. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Cooperative school districts shall be organized solely in accordance with the following procedure:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Any school district pursuant to an article in the warrant for any annual or special meeting may vote to create a cooperative school district planning committee consisting of 3 qualified voters of whom at least one shall be a member of the school board.  The members of the committee shall be elected at the meeting at which the committee is created, unless the district determines that they shall be appointed by the moderator.  The members of the committee shall serve without pay for a term ending (1) at the third annual meeting of the district following the creation of the committee, if the committee is created at an annual meeting, or (2) at the first annual meeting of the district next following the expiration of 3 years from the date of the creation of the committee, if the committee is created at a special meeting, or (3) upon the final adjournment of the organization meeting of any cooperative school district of which the district becomes a part.  If the term of the committee ends at an annual meeting of the district, the district may create a successor cooperative school district planning committee pursuant to the foregoing provisions.  Vacancies on the committee shall be filled by the moderator for the balance of the unexpired term.  The district may appropriate money to meet the expenses of the committee at the meeting at which it is created or at any subsequent district meeting notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 32 or RSA 197:3, and such expenses may include the cost of publication and distribution of reports.  Cooperative school district planning committees from any 2 or more school districts may join together to form a cooperative school district planning board which shall organize by the election of a chairperson and a clerk-treasurer.  The planning board may thereafter admit to membership planning committees from other school districts, but the members of a planning committee shall not be members of more than one planning board at any one time.  A cooperative school district planning board shall act by a majority vote of its total membership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any school district which votes at any annual or special district meeting to create a cooperative school district planning committee under RSA 195:18 shall elect the members of such committee as provided in RSA 195:18.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. It shall be the duty of the cooperative school district planning board to study the advisability of establishing a cooperative school district in accordance with the standards set forth in RSA 195:2, its organization, operation and control, and the advisability of constructing, maintaining and operating a school or schools to serve the needs of such district;  to estimate the construction and operating costs thereof;  to investigate the methods of financing such school or schools, and any other matters pertaining to the organization and operation of a cooperative school district;  and to submit a report or reports of its findings and recommendations to the several school districts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A cooperative school district planning board may recommend that a cooperative school district composed of all the school districts represented by its membership or any specified combination of such school districts be established.  The planning board shall prepare proposed articles of agreement for the proposed cooperative school district, which shall be signed by at least a majority of the membership of the planning board, which set forth the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The school districts which shall be combined to form the proposed cooperative school district and the name of such cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The number, composition, method of selection and terms of office of its cooperative school board, all in accordance with the provisions of RSA 195:19 through 23 inclusive, provided that the cooperative school board shall consist of an odd number of members not more than 15 for terms not exceeding 3 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The grades for which the cooperative school district shall be responsible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The specific properties of pre-existing districts to be acquired by the cooperative school district and the general location of any proposed new schools to be initially established or constructed by the cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The method of apportioning the operating expenses of the cooperative school district among the several preexisting districts and the time and manner of payment of such shares.  Home education pupils who do not receive services from the cooperative school district, except an evaluation pursuant to RSA 193-A:6, II shall not be included in the average daily membership relative to apportionment formulas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The indebtedness of any preexisting district which the cooperative school district is to assume.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The method of apportioning the capital expenses of the cooperative school district among the several preexisting districts, which need not be the same as the method for apportioning operating expenses, and the time and manner of payment of such shares.  Capital expenses shall include the costs of acquiring land and buildings for school purposes, including property owned by a preexisting district;  the construction, furnishing and equipping of school buildings and facilities;  and the payment of the principal and interest of any indebtedness which is incurred to pay for the same or which is assumed by the cooperative school district.  Home education pupils who do not receive services from the cooperative school district, except an evaluation pursuant to RSA 193-A:6, II, shall not be included in the average daily membership relative to apportionment formulas.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The manner in which the state aid referred to in RSA 195:15, or any other available state aid, shall be allocated, unless it is otherwise expressly provided by the law making such aid available.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The method by which the articles of agreement may be amended with the approval of the board;  except that no amendment may permit secession of territory. The provisions adopted under either subparagraph (e) or (g) above may be subject to review pursuant to an article for that purpose duly inserted in the warrant for a district meeting which may be held at any time after the expiration of the 5-year period measured from the date of the first annual meeting.  If the apportionment formula for a cooperative school district has been duly changed, the basis for the apportionment of all such costs may be subject to review pursuant to an article for that purpose duly inserted in the warrant for a district meeting which may be held at any time after the expiration of the 5-year period measured from the date of the meeting at which the last change was made to the cost apportionment.  However, such provisions may be amended at any time in order to permit the enlargement of a cooperative school district or an increase in the number of grades for which the cooperative school district shall be responsible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The date of operating responsibility of the proposed cooperative school district, and a proposed program for the assumption of operating responsibility for education by the proposed cooperative school district and any school construction;  which the cooperative school district shall have the power to vary by vote as circumstances may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Any other matters, not incompatible with law, which the cooperative school district planning board may consider appropriate to include in the articles of agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 195:9, the articles of agreement, or any amendment thereto, may provide for the donation, the sale or the transfer under a lease-purchase agreement of any school property owned by a pre-existing district to the cooperative school district, except that no lease-purchase agreement shall extend for a period of more than 20 years.  The adoption of the articles of agreement or any such amendment shall be sufficient authorization for the appropriate school boards to carry out the transaction.  Obligations incurred by the cooperative school district in connection with any lease-purchase agreement hereunder shall not be deemed indebtedness of the cooperative school district for the purposes of ascertaining its borrowing capacity.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Before final approval of a proposed articles of agreement by the planning board, it shall hold at least one public hearing thereon within the proposed cooperative school district and shall give such notice thereof as it may determine to be reasonable.  An executed copy of the proposed articles of agreement shall be submitted by the planning board to the board, and, when the board finds that the same are in accord with the standards set forth in RSA 195:2, it shall approve the same and cause them to be submitted to the school boards of the several pre-existing districts for acceptance by the districts as provided in paragraph VI.  Upon such submission, the board shall cause the approved articles of agreement to be published once in some newspaper generally circulated within the proposed cooperative school district at the expense of the state.  The planning board may amend a proposed articles of agreement to conform to recommendations of the board after holding a further public hearing thereon with notice as above provided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Upon the receipt of written notice of the board's approval of the articles of agreement, the school board of each preexisting district which is to be included in the cooperative school district shall cause the articles of agreement to be filed with the clerk of such preexisting district and submitted to the voters of the district as soon as may reasonably be possible at an annual meeting or at a special meeting called for the purpose, the voting to be by ballot with the use of the checklist, after reasonable opportunity for debate in open meeting.  The duty to call such meeting for such purpose may be enforced by the superior court in an equity proceeding commenced by any voter or taxpayer of such school district.  The article in the warrant for each district meeting and the question on the ballot to be used at the meeting shall be in substantially the following form:
<blockquote>
"Shall the school district accept the provisions of RSA 195 (as amended) providing for the establishment of a cooperative school district, together with the school districts of __________ and __________ etc., in accordance with the provisions of the proposed articles of agreement filed with the school district clerk?''
</blockQuote>
<PRE>
 Yes _________ No _________
</PRE>
<br>
If a majority of the voters present and voting in each district shall vote in the affirmative, the clerk of each preexisting district shall forthwith send to the board a certified copy of the warrant, certificate of posting, evidence of publication if required, and minutes of the meeting in such district.  If the board finds that a majority of the voters present and voting in each preexisting district meeting have voted in favor of the establishment of the cooperative school district, it shall issue its certificate to that effect.  Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the lawful organization and formation of the cooperative school district as of the date of its issuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If any pre-existing district fails to vote in the affirmative on the proposed articles of agreement within 90 days after its school board receives notice of approval thereof by the board, such district shall be deemed to have rejected the same.  If the proposed articles of agreement fail of adoption as herein required, they may be resubmitted to all or a different combination of the several pre-existing districts either in their original form or as amended by the cooperative school district planning board, with the approval of the board, such articles if amended to be published once by the board as provided in the case of initial articles of agreement in paragraph V, and shall in such case be again acted upon by each district, as provided herein;  but, prior to the approval thereof by the board for resubmission, the planning board shall hold one further hearing thereon as provided in paragraph V in the case of initial articles of agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board shall fix a time and place for a special meeting of the qualified voters within the cooperative school district for the purpose of organization and shall prepare the warrant for the meeting after consultation with the cooperative school district planning board.  The warrant shall include articles for the selection of a school board and other necessary officers, the appropriation of money for the operation of the district, and any other items of business that require action at the organization meeting.  The warrant shall be under the hand of the commissioner, in the name of the board, and the commissioner shall cause attested copies of same to be posted at least 14 days before the meeting in 3 public places in each pre-existing district and a copy of the same to be published at least one week before the date of the meeting in some newspaper generally circulated within the cooperative school district.  The expense of posting and publishing the warrant shall be paid by the state.  The agent or agents of the commissioner who post and cause publication of the warrant shall make a return thereof, which, with the warrant, shall be made a part of the district records.  The organization meeting shall have the same power and authority as an annual meeting with reference to the raising or appropriating of money.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The organization meeting of a cooperative school district shall be called to order by the chairperson of the cooperative school district planning board, or by the clerk-treasurer thereof, who shall serve as temporary chairperson for the first order of business which shall be the election of a moderator and of a temporary clerk, by ballot, who shall be qualified voters of the district.  From and after the issuance of the certificate of formation by the board to the date of operating responsibility of the cooperative school district, such district shall have all the authority and powers of a regular school district for the purposes of incurring indebtedness, for the construction of school facilities and for such other functions as are necessary to obtain proper facilities for a complete program of education.  When necessary in such interim, the school board of the cooperative school district is authorized to prepare a budget and call a special meeting of the voters of the district, which meeting shall have the same authority as an annual meeting, for the purpose of adopting the budget, making necessary appropriations, and borrowing money.  Whenever the organization meeting is held on or before April 20 in any calendar year, no annual meeting need be held in such calendar year.  Sums of money raised and appropriated at the organization meeting or any interim meeting prior to the first annual meeting shall be forthwith certified to the commissioner of revenue administration and the state department of education upon blanks prescribed and provided by the commissioner of revenue administration for the purpose, together with a certificate of estimated revenues, so far as known, and such other information as the commissioner of revenue administration may require.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall examine such certificates and delete any appropriations which appear not made in accordance with the law, and adjust any sum which may be used as a setoff against the amount appropriated when it appears to the commissioner such adjustment is in the best public interest.  The commissioner of revenue administration shall certify to the state department of education the total amount of taxes to be raised for said cooperative school district and the state department of education shall determine the proportional share of said taxes to be borne by each preexisting school district and notify the commissioner of revenue administration of its determination.  Upon certification by the commissioner of revenue administration the selectmen of each town shall seasonably assess the taxes as provided by law.  The selectmen shall pay over to the treasurer of the cooperative district such portion of the sums so raised as may reasonably be required according to a schedule of payments needed for the year as prepared by the treasurer and approved by the cooperative school board, but no such payment shall be greater in percentage to the total sum to be raised by one local district than that of any other local district comprising such cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The provisions of RSA 195:7 and 8 shall not apply to cooperative school districts organized under this section, but all other sections of this chapter shall apply to such districts, except as otherwise expressly provided in this section or in any articles of agreement adopted pursuant hereto.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I-X or any other law to the contrary, no single school district that includes a city shall be prohibited from participating in a school district planning committee.

<codesect>
After the tenth anniversary of the date of operating responsibility, the school board of a cooperative school district may undertake a study of the feasibility and suitability of the withdrawal of one or more member districts from the cooperative district.  A similar study shall be undertaken if, after the tenth anniversary of the date of operating responsibility, a pre-existing district shall, by a majority vote on a warrant article at a regular or special town meeting, direct the school board to conduct such a study.  The study shall be conducted by a committee composed of at least one member of the school board from each of the pre-existing districts, one member of the board of selectmen from each town, and such other members as may be appointed by the committee.  Within 180 days after the date of its formation, the committee shall report its findings to the state board of education.  The committee shall submit to the state board of education either a report that withdrawal is not feasible or suitable, or a report that includes a withdrawal plan prepared in accordance with RSA 195:26.  If the committee determines that withdrawal is not feasible or suitable, the town which voted to undertake the study may submit a minority report at the same time as the committee report is filed with the state board of education.  If the committee report does not include a withdrawal plan, the minority report may include a withdrawal plan prepared in accordance RSA 195:26.  If the state board approves a withdrawal plan, whether submitted by the committee or by minority report, the plan shall be submitted to the voters of the cooperative school district in accordance with RSA 195:29.
