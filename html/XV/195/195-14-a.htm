&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195:14-a Alternative Method of Apportioning Operating Costs. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. As an alternative to the apportionment of operating costs set forth in RSA 195:14, the cooperative school board may fix a specific percentage of the state adequate education grant amount received in a given year to be applied to the operating costs of the cooperative school district, before the apportionment of remaining cooperative school district operating costs.  Such percentage shall not be less than zero percent and not more than 100 percent and shall be the same in each city or town in the cooperative school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The question on the adoption of an alternative method of apportioning operating costs shall be proposed as an article in the warrant of the next cooperative school district annual or special meeting pursuant to RSA 195:13.  A majority of voters present and voting on the question in each city or town in the cooperative school district shall be required to approve the alternative method of apportioning operating costs.  Upon approval, the clerk of the cooperative school district shall send to the state board of education a certified copy of the warrant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The procedure for modification or rescission of an alternative method of apportioning operating costs shall be as set forth in the alternative method of apportioning operating costs and shall not be subject to the provisions of RSA 195:18, III(i).  A majority of voters present and voting on the question in each city or town in the cooperative school district shall be required to approve the modification or rescission.
