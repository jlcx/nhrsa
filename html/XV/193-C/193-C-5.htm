&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193-C:5 Areas of Assessment.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The statewide academic areas to be assessed shall include reading and language arts, mathematics, and science.  History, geography, civics, and economics remain required critical areas of study.  Therefore, assessment of these subjects remains within the purview of the local school board.  The statewide assessment program shall only measure student understanding of key content-specific concepts, skills, and knowledge applied within or across academic content domains.
