&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193-C:1 Statement of Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Improvement and accountability in education are of primary concern to all of the citizens of New Hampshire.  A well-educated populace is essential for the maintenance of democracy, the continued growth of our economy, and the encouragement of personal enrichment and development.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A statewide education improvement and assessment program built upon the establishment of educational standards specifying what students should know and be able to do is an important element in educational improvement.  Such a program also serves as an effective measure of accountability when the assessment exercises or tasks are valid and appropriate representations of the curriculum standards that students are expected to achieve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Widespread participation in the establishment of a statewide education improvement and assessment program is essential.  Consultation with educators at all levels, business people, government officials, community representatives, and parents must occur in the development of educational standards.  In turn, widespread dissemination of those standards, once established, must occur.  Teachers, administrators, and school board members must be fully apprised of these state-developed standards.  They must, in turn, communicate these expectations to students and parents, and find and implement methods to enable students to acquire and apply the requisite knowledge and skills.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In addition, the assessment results must be reported to students, parents, teachers, administrators, school board members, and to all other citizens of New Hampshire in order that informed decisions can be made concerning curriculum, in-service education, instructional improvement, teacher training, resource allocation, and staffing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The purpose of the statewide education improvement and assessment program is not to establish a statewide curriculum.  It is, rather, to establish what New Hampshire students should know and be able to do and to develop and implement effective methods for assessing that learning and its application so that local decisions about curriculum development and delivery can be made.

<center><h3>Section 193-C:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193-C:3 Program Established;  Goals. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
There is established within the department of education a statewide education improvement and assessment program.  The commissioner shall develop and implement this program in conjunction with the state board of education and the legislative oversight committee.  In carrying out this program, the commissioner shall consult widely with educators at all levels, business people, government officials, community representatives, and parents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The aims of this program shall be to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Define what students should know and be able to do.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Develop and implement methods for assessing that learning and its application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Report assessment results to all citizens of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Help to provide accountability at all levels.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Use the results, at both the state and local levels, to improve instruction and advance student learning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Since the program is not a minimum competency testing program, assessment instruments should be designed to reflect the range of learning exhibited by students.  The assessment portion of the program shall consist of a variety of assessment tasks which can be objectively scored.  The assessment instruments shall include, but not be limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Constructed response items which require students to produce answers to questions rather than to select from an array of possible answers.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A writing sample.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Other open-ended performance tasks.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The following criteria shall be used in the development of the program:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Educational standards specifying what students should know and be able to do shall be clearly defined before assessment procedures and exercises are developed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The assessment exercises or tasks shall be valid and appropriate representations of the standards the students are expected to achieve.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At each grade level assessed, the standards and expectations shall be the same for every New Hampshire student.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Teachers shall be involved in designing and using the assessment system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Assessment frameworks and reports shall be understandable and widely disseminated to parents, teachers, administrators, other school personnel, school board members, teacher preparation programs, business people, government officials, and community members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The assessment system shall be subject to continuous review and improvement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The assessment system shall generate data which may be used:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) At the student level, by students, parents, and teachers, to determine what the student knows and is able to do in relationship to the state-established standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) At the classroom and school building levels, to monitor student progress and to enhance learning.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At the district level, to measure school and district-wide progress toward meeting goals and outcomes, to revise curriculum, to design in-service education programs, and to improve instruction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) At the state level, to measure what students know and are able to do in relation to the attainment of goals and outcomes from the assessment frameworks, and to report the results to the citizens of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) At the state level, to target services to schools, improve existing programs, develop new initiatives, and revise standards for school improvement, teacher certification, etc.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) At the college level, to integrate into teacher preparation programs instruction in state-established standards, techniques for enhancing student learning in these areas, and the use of assessment results to improve instruction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) At all levels, to correlate, to the extent possible, with national goals and international standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) At all levels, to provide a basis for accountability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) At the end of grade 3, to determine if pupils are reading at grade level on a standardized reading test to be developed by the department as part of a statewide assessment system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) At the school, district, and state levels, to provide performance reports on specific subgroups of pupils as required by federal law.
