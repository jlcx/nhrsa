Provide a forum for the discussion, development, crystallization and recommendation of public policy alternatives in the field of education.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Provide a clearing house of information on matters relating to educational problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. Facilitate the improvement of state and local educational systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society which requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advance in educational opportunities, methods and facilities.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspB. It is the policy of this compact to encourage and promote local and state initiative in the development, maintenance, improvement and administration of educational systems and institutions in a manner which will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspC. The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the nation, and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.<center><p><b>Article II.

The voting members of the steering committee shall serve for terms of 2 years, except that members elected to the first steering committee of the commission shall be elected as follows:  15 for one year and 15 for 2 years.  The chairman, vice chairman, and treasurer of the commission shall be members of the steering committee and, anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, shall serve during their continuance in these offices.

No person shall serve more than 2 terms as a member of the steering committee:  provided that service for a partial term of one year or less shall not be counted toward the 2 term limitation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspB.
