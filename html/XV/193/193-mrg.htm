&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193:1 Duty of Parent;  Compulsory Attendance by Pupil. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A parent of any child at least 6 years of age and under 18 years of age shall cause such child to attend the public school to which the child is assigned in the child's resident district.  Such child shall attend full time when such school is in session unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The child is attending a New Hampshire public school outside the district to which the child is assigned or an approved New Hampshire private school for the same time;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The child is receiving home education pursuant to RSA 193-A and is therefore exempt from this requirement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The relevant school district superintendent has excused a child from attendance because the child is physically or mentally unable to attend school, or has been temporarily excused upon the request of the parent for purposes agreed upon by the school authorities and the parent.  Such excused absences shall not be permitted if they cause a serious adverse effect upon the student's educational progress.  Students excused for such temporary absences may be claimed as full-time pupils for purposes of calculating state aid under RSA 186-C:18 and adequate education grants under RSA 198:41;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The child is attending a public or private school located in another state which has been approved by the state education agency of the state in which the school is located;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The pupil has been exempted from attendance pursuant to RSA 193:5;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The pupil has successfully completed all requirements for graduation and the school district is prepared to issue a diploma or the pupil has successfully achieved the equivalent of a high school diploma by either:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Obtaining a high school equivalency certificate;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Documenting the completion of a home school program at the high school level by submitting a certificate or letter to the department of education;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The pupil has been accepted into an accredited postsecondary education program;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The pupil obtains a waiver from the superintendent, which shall only be granted upon proof that the pupil is 16 years of age or older and has an alternative learning plan for obtaining either a high school diploma or its equivalent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Alternative learning plans shall include age-appropriate academic rigor and the flexibility to incorporate the pupil's interests and manner of learning.  These plans may include, but are not limited to, such components or combination of components of extended learning opportunities as independent study, private instruction, performing groups, internships, community service, apprenticeships, and on-line courses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Alternative learning plans shall be developed, and amended if necessary, in consultation with the pupil, a school guidance counselor, the school principal and at least one parent or guardian of the pupil, and submitted to the school district superintendent for approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the superintendent does not approve the alternative learning plan, the parent or guardian of the pupil may appeal such decision to the local school board.  A parent or guardian may appeal the decision of the local school board to the state board of education consistent with the provisions of RSA 21-N:11, III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A child who reaches the sixth birthday after September 30 shall not be required to attend school under the provisions of this section until the following school year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In this section, "parent'' means a parent, guardian, or person having legal custody of a child.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Nonpublic, public chartered school, or home educated pupils shall have access to curricular courses and cocurricular programs offered by the school district in which the pupil resides.  The local school board may adopt a policy regulating participation in curricular courses and cocurricular programs, provided that such policy shall not be more restrictive for non-public, public chartered school, or home educated pupils than the policy governing the school district's resident pupils.  In this section, "cocurricular'' shall include those activities which are designed to supplement and enrich regular academic programs of study, provide opportunities for social development, and encourage participation in clubs, athletics, performing groups, and service to school and community.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193:3 Change of School or Assignment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person having custody of a child may apply to the school board for relief if the person thinks the attendance of the child at the school to which such child has been assigned will result in a manifest educational hardship to the child.  If the person having custody of the child is aggrieved by the decision of the school board, the person may appeal to the state board of education, and the state board of education, after investigating the case and giving notice to the school board, may order such child to attend another school in the same district, if such a school is available, or to attend school in another district.  In case the child is assigned to attend school in another district, the district in which such child resides shall pay tuition computed as provided in RSA 193:4 to the district in which such child attends.  The state board of education may also permit such child to withdraw from school attendance for such time as it may deem necessary or proper or may make such other orders with respect to the attendance of such child at school as in its judgment the circumstances require.  Children with disabilities as defined in RSA 186-C:2 shall be accorded a due process review pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 186-C:16.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The state board of education shall adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to manifest educational hardship and related issues which affect a child's attendance at school.  Each school district shall establish a policy, consistent with the state board's rules, which shall allow a school board, with the recommendation of the superintendent, to take appropriate action including, but not limited to, assignment to a public school in another district when manifest educational hardship is shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Each school board shall establish a change of school assignment policy, based on the best interest of the pupil and requiring a vote of the school board to reassign a pupil from the public school to which he or she is currently assigned to another public school, or to approve a request from another superintendent to accept a transfer of a pupil from a school district that is not part of the school administrative unit, provided that the following conditions are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The pupil's parent or legal guardian petitions the superintendent for a change of school assignment or consents to the superintendent's recommendation for such a change;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The superintendent determines that such a change would be in the pupil's best interest;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The school board of each school district involved in the reassignment of the pupil votes to approve the reassignment;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The total reassignments or transfers in any one school year shall not exceed one percent of the average daily membership in residence of a school district, or 5 percent of the average daily membership in residence of any single school, whichever is greater, unless the school board votes to exceed this limit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In accordance with the number of pupils authorized in this paragraph, a superintendent may recommend reassignment of a pupil:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) To another school within the same school district;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) To another school district within the same school administrative unit;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) To a school district in another school administrative unit, subject to the pupil meeting the admission requirements of such school, and subject to the agreement of the superintendent of the receiving school administrative unit and the approval of the school boards of each school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A pupil reassigned under this paragraph shall be counted in the average daily membership in residence of the pupil's resident school district.  The pupil's resident district shall forward any tuition payment due to the district to which the pupil was reassigned.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The superintendents involved in the reassignment of a pupil shall jointly establish a tuition rate for each such pupil.  Some or all of the tuition may be waived by the superintendent of the receiving district for the good cause shown or pursuant to school board policy of the receiving district.  The cost of transportation shall be the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The superintendent of the pupil's resident school administrative unit shall notify the department of education within 30 days of any reassignment of pupils under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Nothing in this paragraph shall alter or impair the right of a child with a disability, as defined in RSA 186-C:2, to be accorded a due process review pursuant to rules adopted under RSA 186-C:16.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Notwithstanding RSA 21-N:11, III, for the purposes of this paragraph, the decision of the superintendent shall be final.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) Any person having custody of a child may apply to enroll that child in a public school or public academy outside the school district in which the person and child reside.  If the non-resident school district or public academy agrees to enroll the child it may charge tuition to the parent or may enter into an agreement for payment of tuition with the school district in which the child resides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) When a child is enrolled pursuant to subparagraph (a), the district in which the child is enrolled shall immediately notify the district in which the child resides of the name, date of birth, address, and grade assignment of the child.  This same notification shall be made at the beginning of each school year for which the child is enrolled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) When a child is enrolled pursuant to subparagraph (a), the district in which the child resides shall retain all responsibility for the provision of special education and related services pursuant to RSA 186-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The decision by a school district or a public academy to deny enrollment of a non-resident pupil shall not be based, in whole or in part, on whether such pupil is a child with a disability as defined in RSA 186-C:2, I, or a child that requires an accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The decision of a parent to enroll a child in a charter school shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Disputes related to the provision of special education services under this paragraph shall be governed by RSA 186-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A placement made by a child's special education team pursuant to that child's individualized education program shall not be deemed a change of school assignment for purposes of this section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193:12 Legal Residence Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall attend school, or send a pupil to the school, in any district of which the pupil is not a legal resident, without the consent of the district or of the school board except as otherwise provided in this section or in RSA 193:28.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For purposes of this section, the legal residence of a pupil shall be as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of a minor, legal residence is where his or her parents reside, except that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the parents live apart and are not divorced, legal residence is the residence of the parent with whom the child resides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2)(A) In a divorce decree where parents are awarded joint decision making responsibility or joint legal custody, the legal residence of a minor child is the residence of the parent with whom the child resides.  In a divorce decree, or parenting plan developed pursuant to RSA 461-A, a child's legal residence for school attendance purposes may be the school district in which either parent resides, provided the parents agree in writing to the district the child will attend and each parent furnishes a copy of the agreement to the school district in which the parent resides.  The parents shall update their parenting plan to reflect this agreement.  If a parent is awarded sole or primary residential responsibility or physical custody by a court of competent jurisdiction in this or any other state, legal residence of a minor child is the residence of the parent who has sole or primary residential responsibility or physical custody.  If the parent with sole or primary physical custody lives outside the state of New Hampshire, the pupil does not have residence in New Hampshire.  If the court order is for equal or approximately equal periods of residential responsibility, the child's legal residence for school attendance purposes shall be as stated in the order.  If a child is in a court-ordered residential placement, foster home, or group home pursuant to RSA 169-B, RSA 169-C, RSA 169-D, RSA 170-C, or RSA 463, residence shall be determined in accordance with RSA 193:28.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Nothing in this subparagraph shall require a school district to provide transportation for a child to another school in the school district in which the child resides, or beyond the designated attendance area for the school to which the child is assigned, or beyond the geographical limits of the school district in which the child resides.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the minor is in the custody of a legal guardian appointed by a New Hampshire court of competent jurisdiction or a court of competent jurisdiction in another state, territory, or country, legal residence is where the guardian resides.  If the department of health and human services has been appointed legal guardian, the residence of the minor is where the child is placed by the department or the court.  Legal guardianship shall not be appointed solely for the purpose of allowing a pupil to attend school in a district other than the district of residence of the minor's parent or parents.  Whenever a petition for guardianship or legal custody is filed in a court of competent jurisdiction on behalf of a relative of a child, other than a parent, the child shall be permitted to attend school in the district in which the relative of the child resides pending a court determination relative to custody or guardianship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No minor placed in a home for children or health care facility, as defined in RSA 193:27, by another state which charges the state of New Hampshire, a political subdivision of the state of New Hampshire, or a New Hampshire school district, for the regular or special education costs for New Hampshire children placed in that state, shall be deemed a legal resident for purposes of school assignment, unless the sending state agrees to reimburse the receiving district, as defined in RSA 193:27, for regular education and special education costs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c)(1) If a parent with legal custody of a child moves from New Hampshire to another state while the child is in a court-ordered residential placement in this state or another state pursuant to RSA 169-B, RSA 169-C, RSA 169-D, RSA 170-C, or RSA 463, the departments of education and health and human services shall make a written request of the receiving state to assume the programmatic and financial liability of the child's placement in this state or another state until physical custody of the child is returned to a parent or legal guardian.  In this subparagraph, "receiving state'' shall mean the state to which the child's parents move.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the receiving state refuses to accept financial liability, the departments of education and health and human services shall enter into an agreement to provide the child with general and special education and residential services until legal custody of the child is returned to a parent or legal guardian.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purposes of this title, "legal resident'' of a school district means a natural person who is domiciled in the school district and who, if temporarily absent, demonstrates an intent to maintain a principal dwelling place in the school district indefinitely and to return there, coupled with an act or acts consistent with that intent.  A married person may have a domicile independent of the domicile of his or her spouse.  If a person removes to another town with the intention of remaining there indefinitely, that person shall be considered to have lost residence in the town in which the person originally resided even though the person intends to return at some future time.  A person may have only one legal residence at a given time.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The term "homeless children and youths'' means individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, and shall include the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Children and youths who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason;  are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations;  are living in emergency or transitional shelters;  are abandoned in hospitals;  or are awaiting foster care placement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Children and youths who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Children and youths who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Migratory children, as defined in 20 U.S.C. 6399 who qualify as homeless because such children are living in circumstances as described in subparagraphs (a)-(c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as provided in subparagraph II(b), nothing in this section shall limit or abridge the right of any child placed and cared for in any home for children, as defined in RSA 193:27, or of any child placed in the home of a relative of that child by the department of health and human services, or placed in the home of a relative or friend by a court pursuant to RSA 169-B, RSA 169-C, RSA 169-D, RSA 170-C, or RSA 463, to attend the public schools of the school district in which the home for children or home of the relative or friend in which a child is placed by the department of health and human services or by a court of competent jurisdiction is located, as provided in RSA 193:28.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. Whenever a parent or guardian voluntarily places a child with a relative at the recommendation or request of the department of health and human services, that child shall be permitted to attend the public schools of the school district in which that relative resides provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon request of the school district, the department of health and human services shall confirm that the department recommended or requested that the child be placed with the relative to promote the child's well being, and not for the purpose of allowing the child to attend school in the district where the relative resides;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon request of the school district, the relative shall take reasonable steps to secure a court award of guardianship over the child, the child being allowed to attend school in that district while the relative seeks guardianship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-b. Whenever a dispute arises among one or more school districts, the department of health and human services, or one or more of the previously mentioned parties, as to the residency of a child who is in the legal custody or guardianship of the department of health and human services, or who has been placed pursuant to a court order in a proceeding under RSA 169-B, RSA 169-C, RSA 169-D, or RSA 463, the department of health and human services shall request in writing that the superintendents involved resolve the dispute.  If the residency dispute remains unresolved 10 days after such request, the department of health and human services shall request that the commissioner of the department of education determine the residence of the child.  The child shall be permitted to attend school in the district in which the child has been placed by the court or the department of health and human services pending the resolution of the residency dispute.  Liability as to the cost of school attendance provided under this paragraph shall be determined by the commissioner of education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) The commissioner of the department of education, or designee, shall decide residency issues for all pupils, excluding homeless children and youths, in accordance with this section.  If more than one school district is involved in a residency dispute, or the parents who live apart cannot agree on the residence of a minor child, the respective superintendents shall jointly make such decision.  In those instances when an agreement cannot be reached, the commissioner of the department of education, or designee, shall make a determination within 30 days of notice of the residency dispute and such determination shall be final.  If the unresolved residency dispute has resulted in an interruption of educational or related services, or such an interruption is likely to occur if the determination cannot be made before the expiration of 30 days, the determination shall be made within 14 days.  With the agreement of the school districts involved and of the minor child's parent or legal representative, the time for determination of the residency dispute may be extended.  Residency disputes may be submitted to the commissioner for determination by a school district involved in a dispute.  In cases where the failure to resolve a residency dispute has resulted in or is likely to result in the interruption of educational or related services, a minor child's parent or legal representative may submit a residency dispute for determination to the commissioner.  In all cases, all parties with an interest in the dispute shall be notified of the pendency of the proceedings, shall have an opportunity to review all information provided to the commissioner, and shall have an opportunity to present facts and legal arguments to the commissioner.  The commissioner's decision, including a written explanation for that decision, shall be provided to the parties of record and a copy of such explanation shall be kept on file by the department of education.  No school district shall deny a pupil attendance or implementation of an existing individualized education program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A pupil shall remain in attendance in the pupil's school of origin during the pendency of a determination of residency.  If a child does not have a school of origin within this state, the child shall be immediately admitted to the school in which enrollment is sought pending determination of the residency dispute, provided such school is in the school district in which the child temporarily resides.  For the purpose of this paragraph, "school of origin'' means the school the child attended when permanently housed or the school in which the child was last enrolled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 21-N:11, III any person aggrieved by a determination of the commissioner may appeal such determination to a court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Nothing in this section shall require a district to provide transportation for a student beyond the geographical limits of that district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Each school district shall adopt an admission and attendance of non-resident students policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The commissioner of education may enter into agreements with other states relative to liability for educational costs, including special education costs, of students placed in New Hampshire by those states, or of students placed outside the state of New Hampshire.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. For the purpose of determining liability for a child placed and cared for in any home for children or health care facility, the provisions of RSA 193:29 shall apply.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The superintendent or chief administering officer, or a representative designated in writing by the superintendent, is authorized to suspend pupils from school for a period not to exceed 10 school days for gross misconduct or for neglect or refusal to conform to the reasonable rules of the school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The school board or a representative designated in writing of the school board is authorized, following a hearing, to continue the suspension of a pupil for a period in excess of 10 school days.  The school board's designee may be the superintendent or any other individual, but may not be the individual who suspended the pupil for the first 10 days under subparagraph (a).  Any suspension shall be valid throughout the school districts of the state, subject to modification by the superintendent of the school district in which the pupil seeks to enroll.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any suspension in excess of 10 school days imposed under subparagraph (b) by any person other than the school board is appealable to the school board, provided that the superintendent received such appeal in writing within 10 days after the issuance of the decision being appealed.  The school board shall hold a hearing on the appeal, but shall have discretion to hear evidence or to rely upon the record of a hearing conducted under subparagraph (b).  The suspension under subparagraph (b) shall be enforced while that appeal is pending, unless the school board stays the suspension while the appeal is pending.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any pupil who brings or possesses a firearm as defined in section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code in a safe school zone as defined in RSA 193-D:1 without written authorization from the superintendent or designee shall be expelled from school by the local school board for a period of not less than 12 months.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The local school board shall adopt a policy which allows the superintendent or chief administering officer to modify the expulsion requirements set forth in paragraphs II and III on a case by case basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any pupil expelled by a local school board under the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 shall not be eligible to enroll in another school district in New Hampshire for the period of such expulsion.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A pupil expelled from school in another state under the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 shall not be eligible to enroll in a school district in New Hampshire for the period of such expulsion.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For any child placed and cared for in any home for children or health care facility, the sending district shall make payments to the receiving district as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) For a child attending a public school in the receiving district who receives special education as required by RSA 186-C, the sending district is liable for either the average per pupil cost of the receiving district as estimated by the state board of education under RSA 193:4, or for the actual prorated cost of the special education and any related services, as defined in RSA 186-C:2, provided by the receiving district, whichever is greater.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For a child attending a public school to which the receiving district as defined in RSA 193:27 shall pay tuition under an AREA or other contractual agreement, the sending district as defined in RSA 193:27 is liable for all costs which said receiving district must pay under that agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a child is assigned to an out-of-district special education program, the sending district is liable for all costs under RSA 186-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Actual fiscal liability under paragraph I commences upon enactment of this statute.  However, the determination of liability as applied in paragraph I refers to children placed in a home for children or health care facility prior to as well as subsequent to enactment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the receiving district receives any state or federal aid for educating a child in any home for children or health care facility, including but not limited to aid for foster children under RSA 198:23, that amount shall be deducted from the liability of the sending district for that child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h2>Parents as Teachers Program</h2></center>

<center><h3>Section 193:34</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193:34 Policy and Purposes. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. This act recognizes the importance of the early childhood years upon children's brain development.  Given appropriate stimulation, babies develop critical cognitive and social skills from birth to age 3.  These early years provide a window of opportunity to enrich a child's cognitive and social development.  The least intrusive and most successful way to impact early childhood experiences is to educate parents as to how they can best teach their children.  Studies have shown that parents who are trained as to how to interact with their children can help their children enter school ready to learn and are more likely to stay involved with their child's educational process throughout the school years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The Parents as Teachers Program was established in 1981 and has a presence in 49 states, including New Hampshire.  The New Hampshire program is operated at 8 sites in New Hampshire by the Parent Information Center with funds from Goals 2000.  The Parents as Teachers Program creates a partnership between parents and early childhood development professionals.  Early childhood development professionals conduct monthly home visits and group meetings to help parents understand what to expect from their children in each stage of development and to teach parents how to encourage learning, manage challenging behavior and strengthen parent-child relationships.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The purpose of this subdivision is to expand the Parents as Teachers Program in New Hampshire by developing 2 school district based programs, one of which shall be in a rural community and one in an urban community.

<center><h3>Section 193:35</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193:35 Parents as Teachers Program Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of education shall establish the school district based Parents as Teachers Program for a rural community in Sullivan county in cooperation with School Administrative Unit 6 and the Parent Information Center.  Sullivan county will be the rural site for the program because of its unique demographic profile, including the high number of risk factors affecting its children, the demonstrated interest of its public officials in the program, and the capacity to link the program to existing programs within the county including Good Beginnings, the Parent Information Center, and department of education programs in Sullivan county.  The department shall use the following criteria to measure the effectiveness of the program:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whether the pilot program was implemented according to the criteria established by the Parents as Teachers National Center.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The number of families served, the number of contacts with each family, and family profile information for the families served, including the percentages of families served by town.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The total cost and the cost per family for the program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The number of children identified with Parents as Teachers participants that were identified as having developmental delays who have received services during the pilot program to address these delays.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The number of children identified with Parents as Teachers participants who were, during the pilot program, the subject of a founded report of abuse or neglect pursuant to RSA 169-C.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The results of 3-year-old developmental screening for all children of appropriate age identified with Parents as Teachers participants.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The level of parental participant knowledge and achievement including, but not limited to high school equivalency completion, employment, and volunteerism.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department shall, consistent with available funding and the expressed commitment of an urban community, establish a school district based Parents as Teachers Program in an urban community on or before January 1, 2002.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The programs established by this subdivision shall serve parents of children aged birth through 3 years of age.  The programs shall utilize at least  1/2 of the appropriated funds to serve areas with high concentrations of low income families in order to serve parents who are educationally or economically disadvantaged.
