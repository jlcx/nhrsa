&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193:1-c Access to Public School Programs by Nonpublic, Public Chartered Schools or Home Educated Pupils. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Nonpublic, public chartered school, or home educated pupils shall have access to curricular courses and cocurricular programs offered by the school district in which the pupil resides.  The local school board may adopt a policy regulating participation in curricular courses and cocurricular programs, provided that such policy shall not be more restrictive for non-public, public chartered school, or home educated pupils than the policy governing the school district's resident pupils.  In this section, "cocurricular'' shall include those activities which are designed to supplement and enrich regular academic programs of study, provide opportunities for social development, and encourage participation in clubs, athletics, performing groups, and service to school and community.  For purposes of allowing access as described in this section, a "home educated pupil'' shall not include any pupil who has graduated from a high school level program of home education, or its equivalent, or has attained the age of 21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a parent to establish a home education program which exceeds the requirements of RSA 193:1.
