<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No school board shall adopt a policy of automatically separating or placing together twins or other multiples.  In this section, "multiples'' means triplets or more.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A parent or guardian of twins or other multiples in elementary school may, no later than 60 days before the first day of each school year or upon registration in the case of children enrolling in a new school, request that the twins or multiples be placed in the same classroom or in separate classrooms.  This request shall be granted unless the principal, after meeting with the parents or guardians and after careful consideration of the reasons for their recommendation and of the best interests of their children and other children in the school affected by this decision, decides that a different placement is necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This section is not intended to limit a parent's or guardian's right to appeal.
