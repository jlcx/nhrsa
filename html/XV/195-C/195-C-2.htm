&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195-C:2 State Guarantee. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Upon the receipt of a report from the authority containing a recommendation that bonds or notes of a school district should be guaranteed by the state, the governor with the advice and consent of the council may award an unconditional state guarantee with respect to such bonds or notes in accordance with the authority's recommendation or in some lesser amount or percentage, or on the alternative basis of guarantee, as the best interests of the state may require.  The full faith and credit of the state are and shall be pledged for any such guarantees, and the total outstanding amount of the principal of and interest on such bonds and notes which has been guaranteed by the state under this section shall at no time exceed $95,000,000.  The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, is authorized to draw a warrant for such a sum out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of honoring any guarantee awarded under this section.  In the event that any state funds shall be so used, the state may recover the amount thereof as provided in RSA 530.
