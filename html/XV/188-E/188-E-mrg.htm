<codesect>
The commissioner, department of education, is hereby authorized and directed to designate high schools, and public academies as defined in RSA 194:23, II, offering career and technical education programs as career and technical education centers.  In instances where it is educationally and economically feasible to do so, the commissioner may designate individual career and technical education programs in other than the career and technical education centers as regional programs.  An out-of-state school or program may be designated, when it is in the best interest of the state, as a part of the New Hampshire regional career and technical education plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 188-E:3 Construction or Renovation of Regional Career and Technical Education Centers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner, department of education, shall make grants available to designated regional centers for construction of career and technical education facilities or renovation of existing regional career and technical education centers.  The state board shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A and RSA 21-N:9, II, which the commissioner shall carry out, relative to requirements for approval of regional career and technical education centers to receive funds for construction or renovation of such facilities.  The rules shall include criteria which guarantee potential sending districts an opportunity to enroll students in the regional career and technical education program, and basic criteria for planning such facilities through cooperative development of plans by the career and technical education staff of the state department of education and the local school district's staff.  When such plans appear to be both educationally and financially acceptable, the department's career and technical education staff shall recommend to the commissioner that they be approved for funding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon completion, the constructed or renovated facility shall become the property of the school district or public academy, for use by the career and technical education center exclusively.  Provision of the site, parking, and other related areas shall be the responsibility of the local community.  Site work, including but not limited to cut and fill work, compaction, demolition, relocation of utilities, relocation of roadways and sidewalks, and similar work within an area extending to one foot beyond the outside edge of the exterior walls of the building, shall be eligible for grants under paragraph I.  Nothing shall prohibit the inclusion of the site and related facilities which are not funded as part of construction cost by the state under this chapter from being included in a regular building aid grant application of the district as provided in RSA 198:15-b.  However, no school district which receives any funding under this chapter shall be eligible to receive school building aid grants under RSA 198:15-b for the same project.  Maintenance, repair, and upkeep of the constructed or renovated facility, including all classroom and laboratory spaces, shall be the responsibility of the school district or public academy, as the case may be.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 188-E:11 Equipment and Instruction Program;  Revolving Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established an equipment and instruction program in which any regional vocational center may establish a revolving fund to be used for capital improvement costs for the replacement or upgrading of equipment, or for aiding instruction in the various vocational programs offered by the center.  The fund shall be used to pay necessary costs of equipment and related instructional materials which are required to provide up-to-date adult, business and industry training, re-training or customized programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a revolving fund is established, the revenues from non-school district sources generated by vocational educational programs in excess of legitimate and customary school district expenses shall be placed in the fund.  Such revenues shall include, but are not limited to, profits from program operations consisting of capitalization costs calculated as part of rental services, cash gifts to vocational education programs, and moneys from the sale of donated equipment.  The revolving fund shall be established as a separate school district account and shall be used only for the purposes specified in paragraph I.
