&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 188-E:1 Designation of Regional Centers and Courses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner, department of education, is hereby authorized and directed to designate high schools, and public academies as defined in RSA 194:23, II, offering vocational education programs as vocational education centers.  In instances where it is educationally and economically feasible to do so, the commissioner may designate individual vocational courses in other than the vocational education centers as regional courses.  An out-of-state school or course may be designated, when it is in the best interest of the state, as a part of the New Hampshire regional vocational education plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 188-E:3 Construction or Renovation of Regional Vocational Centers. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner, department of education, shall make grants available to designated regional centers for construction of vocational education facilities or renovation of existing regional vocational centers.  The state board shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A and RSA 21-N:9, II, which the commissioner shall carry out, relative to requirements for approval of regional vocational education centers to receive funds for construction or renovation of such facilities.  The rules shall include criteria which guarantee potential sending districts an opportunity to enroll students in the regional vocational program, and basic criteria for planning such facilities through cooperative development of plans by the vocational education staff of the state department of education and the local school district's staff.  When such plans appear to be both educationally and financially acceptable, the department's vocational staff shall recommend to the commissioner that they be approved for funding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon completion, the constructed or renovated facility shall become the property of the school district or public academy, as the case may be.  Provision of the site, parking, and other related areas shall be the responsibility of the local community.  Site work, including but not limited to cut and fill work, compaction, demolition, relocation of utilities, relocation of roadways and sidewalks, and similar work within an area extending to one foot beyond the outside edge of the exterior walls of the building, shall be eligible for grants under paragraph I. Nothing shall prohibit the inclusion of the site and related facilities which are not funded as part of construction cost by the state under this chapter from being included in a regular building aid grant application of the district as provided in RSA 198:15-b.  However, no school district which receives any funding under this chapter shall be eligible to receive school building aid grants under RSA 198:15-b for the same project.
