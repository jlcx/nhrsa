&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 188-E:1 Designation of Regional Centers and Courses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner, department of education, is hereby authorized and directed to designate high schools, and public academies as defined in RSA 194:23, II, offering vocational education programs as vocational education centers.  In instances where it is educationally and economically feasible to do so, the commissioner may designate individual vocational courses in other than the vocational education centers as regional courses.  An out-of-state school or course may be designated, when it is in the best interest of the state, as a part of the New Hampshire regional vocational education plan.
