&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 188-E:1 Designation of Regional Centers and Programs.  &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commissioner, department of education, is hereby authorized and directed to designate high schools, and public academies as defined in RSA 194:23, II, offering career and technical education programs as career and technical education centers.  In instances where it is educationally and economically feasible to do so, the commissioner may designate individual career and technical education programs in other than the career and technical education centers as regional programs.  An out-of-state school or program may be designated, when it is in the best interest of the state, as a part of the New Hampshire regional career and technical education plan.
