&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Occurs off of school property or outside of a school-sponsored activity or event, if the conduct interferes with a pupil's educational opportunities or substantially disrupts the orderly operations of the school or school-sponsored activity or event.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The school board of each school district and the board of trustees of a chartered public school shall, no later than 6 months after the effective date of this section, adopt a written policy prohibiting bullying and cyberbullying.  Such policy shall include the definitions set forth in RSA 193-F:3.  The policy shall contain, at a minimum, the following components:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A statement prohibiting bullying or cyberbullying of a pupil.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement prohibiting retaliation or false accusations against a victim, witness, or anyone else who in good faith provides information about an act of bullying or cyberbullying and, at the time a report is made, a process for developing, as needed, a plan to protect pupils from retaliation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A requirement that all pupils are protected regardless of their status under the law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A statement that there shall be disciplinary consequences or interventions, or both, for a pupil who commits an act of bullying or cyberbullying, or falsely accuses another of the same as a means of retaliation or reprisal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A statement indicating how the policy shall be made known to school employees, regular school volunteers, pupils, parents, legal guardians, or employees of a company under contract to a school, school district, or chartered public school.  Recommended methods of communication include, but are not limited to, handbooks, websites, newsletters, and workshops.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A procedure outlining the internal reporting requirements within the school or school district or chartered public school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The content of the notification shall comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. 1232g.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) A provision that the superintendent or designee may, within the 48-hour period, grant the school principal or designee a waiver from the notification requirement if the superintendent or designee deems such waiver to be in the best interest of the victim or perpetrator.  Any such waiver granted shall be in writing.  Granting of a waiver shall not negate the school's responsibility to adhere to the remainder of its approved written policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) A written procedure for investigation of reports, to be initiated within 5 school days of the reported incident, identifying either the principal or the principal's designee as the person responsible for the investigation and the manner and time period in which the results of the investigation shall be documented.  The superintendent or designee may grant in writing an extension of the time period for the investigation and documentation of reports for up to an additional 7 school days, if necessary.  The superintendent or superintendent's designee shall notify in writing all parties involved of the granting of an extension.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) A requirement that the principal or designee develop a response to remediate any substantiated incident of bullying or cyberbullying, including imposing discipline if appropriate, to reduce the risk of future incidents and, where deemed appropriate, to offer assistance to the victim or perpetrator.  When indicated, the principal or designee shall recommend a strategy for protecting all pupils from retaliation of any kind.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) A requirement that the principal or designee report all substantiated incidents of bullying or cyberbullying to the superintendent or designee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) Identification, by job title, of school officials responsible for ensuring that the policy is implemented.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The department of education may develop a model policy in accordance with the requirements set forth in this chapter which may be used by schools, school districts, and chartered public schools as a basis for adopting a local policy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A school board or board of trustees of a chartered public school shall, to the greatest extent practicable, involve pupils, parents, administrators, school staff, school volunteers, community representatives, and local law enforcement agencies in the process of developing the policy.  The policy shall be adopted by all public schools within the school district and, to the extent possible, the policy should be integrated with the school's curriculum, discipline policies, behavior programs, and other violence prevention efforts.
