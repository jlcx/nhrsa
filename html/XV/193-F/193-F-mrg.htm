&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193-F:2 Purpose and Intent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All pupils have the right to attend public schools, including chartered public schools, that are safe, secure, and peaceful environments.  One of the legislature's highest priorities is to protect our children from physical, emotional, and psychological violence by addressing the harm caused by bullying and cyberbullying in our public schools.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Bullying in schools has historically included actions shown to be motivated by a pupil's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry or ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, physical, mental, emotional, or learning disability, gender, gender identity and expression, obesity, or other distinguishing personal characteristics, or based on association with any person identified in any of the above categories.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. It is the intent of the legislature to protect our children from physical, emotional, and psychological violence by addressing bullying and cyberbullying of any kind in our public schools, for all of the historical reasons set forth in this section, and to prevent the creation of a hostile educational environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The sole purpose of this chapter is to protect all children from bullying and cyberbullying, and no other legislative purpose is intended, nor should any other intent be construed from the enactment of this chapter.
