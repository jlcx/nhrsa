If the state board disapproves the plan, the state board's designee shall work with the school or school district to amend the plan so that it meets state board approval.  One year following the designation, if the school or school district is not making satisfactory progress in implementing its plan, the commissioner of education shall issue a notice to the school or school district and shall initiate a process for providing assistance pursuant to paragraph II;  or
