&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193-H:1-a Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of this chapter is to create an accountability model that will best support schools and educators as they work to enable all students to progress toward college and career readiness with clearly defined learning outcomes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. New Hampshire's student assessment system should promote and measure knowledge and skills that lead students to graduate from high schools ready for college and career.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Students best learn at their own pace as they master content and skills, allowing them to advance when they demonstrate the desired level of mastery rather than progressing based on a predetermined amount of seat time in a classroom will assure that students will reach college and career readiness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. New Hampshire's system of educator support should promote the capacity of educators to deeply engage students in learning rigorous and meaningful knowledge, skills, and work-study practices for success in college, career, and citizenship.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Competency-based strategies provide flexibility in the way that credit can be earned and awarded and provide students with personalized learning, including those that are offered through on-line, blended, and community based opportunities.

Any such decision shall be included in the corrective action plan.
