The council shall prescribe the means for presenting evidence of the fulfillment of these requirements.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. At the earliest practicable time, the police standards and training council shall require that all uncertified part-time and full-time police officers, state corrections officers, and probation-parole officers, prior to assuming their duties, successfully pass a medical examination including a drug screening administered under the direction of a licensed physician according to protocols adopted by the council.  Such examination, when conducted, shall be valid for a period of one year for purposes of application for employment.

III-b.

III-c. No later than January 1, 1999, the police standards and training council shall require that all uncertified part-time and full-time police officers, state corrections officers, and probation-parole officers, prior to assuming their duties, successfully pass a psychological screening test battery administered under the direction of a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist according to protocols adopted by the council and designed to detect behavioral traits that could adversely affect the person's ability to perform the essential functions of a law enforcement officer.  Such an examination shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of administration for purposes of application for such employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-d. Beginning January 1, 2001, the police standards and training council shall require that all certified police officers, state corrections officers, and probation-parole officers, hired after that date, as a condition of continued certification and employment furnish the council every 3 years with a certificate from a licensed physician, physician's assistant, or registered nurse practitioner who has conducted a medical examination of the officer according to protocols adopted by the council, certifying that in the opinion of the examiner the officer is physically capable of participating in the council's physical fitness test.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-e. Any officer who is unable to meet the medical requirements of paragraph III-d may request an additional medical examination by a physician chosen by the council.  If the officer is still unable to meet the standards, such officer's certification shall be placed in a probationary status for a period of up to 2 years, during which time the officer may request re-examination at any time.  If following the 2-year period the officer is still unable to meet the standards, the officer's certification shall be suspended until such time as such officer obtains the medical certification required in paragraph III-d.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-f. Beginning January 1, 2001, the police standards and training council shall require that all certified police officers, state corrections officers, and probation-parole officers, hired after that date, as a condition of continued certification and employment every 3 years pass a physical fitness performance test administered by the hiring authority or the council, according to protocols adopted by the council.

If, following the 2-year period, the officer is still unable to meet the standards, the officer's certification shall be suspended until such time as such officer is able to pass the physical performance test.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-h. In any case where the council has reasonable grounds to doubt that the medical examination performed as required in paragraph III-d was performed in accordance with the appropriate protocols, the council may require the officer to submit to a separate examination by a physician selected by the council, at the council's expense.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-i. A licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or person acting under the licensee's supervision, whose examination administered under this chapter results in an employment decision adverse to a police, corrections, or probation-parole officer shall be immune from suit resulting from such examination or decision, providing such examination is conducted in good faith, not in a wanton or reckless manner.
