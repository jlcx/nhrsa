I. The general court finds that because of the importance of public community college education, elected officials should be aware of the activities and needs of the community college system, exercising their responsibility for legislative oversight through (1) the consideration by the appropriate legislative committees of proposed legislation pertaining to the community college system;  and (2) the consideration of reports filed by the community college system of New Hampshire pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court also recognizes the need to protect the institutions of the community college system of New Hampshire from inappropriate external influence which might threaten the academic freedom of faculty members or otherwise inhibit the pursuit of academic excellence.  To this end, the general court has delegated broad authority to the board of trustees who shall be responsible for managing the community college system of New Hampshire in a manner which promotes academic excellence and serves the educational needs of the people of New Hampshire.
