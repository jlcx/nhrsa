<codesect>
In case the expenditure of additional funds is necessary to meet the statutory obligations of the police standards and training council for the training of police and corrections officers on a timely basis because of unanticipated circumstances beyond the control of the police standards and training council, the governor and council, with approval of the legislative fiscal committee, upon request of the police standards and training council, may authorize the transfer of unappropriated amounts from the police standards and training council training fund for such purposes.
