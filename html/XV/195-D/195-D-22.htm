The state does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds, notes and other obligations issued under this chapter, and with those parties who may enter into contracts with the corporation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, that the state will not limit, alter, restrict, or impair the rights hereby vested in the corporation and the participating institutions to acquire, construct, reconstruct, maintain and operate any project as defined in this chapter or to establish, revise, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and other charges as may be convenient or necessary to produce sufficient revenues to meet the expenses of maintenance and operation thereof and to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the holders of bonds, notes or other obligations authorized and issued by this chapter, and with the parties who may enter into contracts with the corporation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or in any way impair the rights or remedies of the holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations or such parties until the bonds, notes and such other obligations, together with interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the bondholders, are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed on the part of the corporation.  However, nothing in this chapter precludes such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provision is made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations of the corporation or those entering into such contracts with the corporation.
