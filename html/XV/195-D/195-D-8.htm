&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195-D:8 Notes of the Corporation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The corporation has the power and is hereby authorized from time to time to issue its negotiable notes for any corporate purpose, including the payment of all or any part of the cost of any project or the refinancing of existing indebtedness, and renew from time to time any notes by the issuance of new notes, whether the notes to be renewed have or have not matured.  The corporation may issue notes partly to renew notes or to discharge other obligations then outstanding and partly for any other purpose.  The notes may be authorized, sold, executed and delivered in the same manner as bonds.  Any resolution or resolutions authorizing notes of the corporation or any issue thereof may contain any provisions which the corporation is authorized to include in any resolution or resolutions authorizing revenue bonds of the corporation or any issue thereof, and the corporation may include in any notes any terms, covenants or conditions which it is authorized to include in any bonds.  All such notes shall be payable solely from the revenues of the corporation, subject only to any contractual rights of the holders of any of its notes or other obligations then outstanding.
