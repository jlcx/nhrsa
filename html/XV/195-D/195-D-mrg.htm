Four members of the board of directors constitute a quorum, and the vote of a majority of the members constituting a quorum present and voting is necessary for any action taken by the corporation.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any action taken by the corporation under the provisions of this chapter may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution shall take effect immediately and need not be published or posted.  However, any action taken that directly affects any institution by name is not effective as to that institution until notice of the action has been delivered to the institution, by mail or otherwise.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The corporation is authorized to issue its negotiable revenue bonds from time to time for any corporate purposes, including the financing of all or part of the costs of any projects or the refinancing of existing indebtedness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In anticipation of the sale of such revenue bonds the corporation may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes and may renew the same from time to time, but the maximum maturity of any such note, including renewals thereof, shall not exceed 5 years from the date of issue of the original note.  Such notes shall be paid from any revenues of the corporation available therefor and not otherwise pledged, or from the proceeds of sale of the revenue bonds of the corporation in anticipation of which they were issued.  The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the revenue bonds.  Such notes and the resolution or resolutions authorizing the same may contain any provisions, conditions, or limitations which a bond resolution of the corporation may contain.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In the event that term bonds are issued, the resolution authorizing the same may make such provisions for the establishment and management of adequate sinking funds for the payment thereof, as the corporation judges necessary.  The revenue bonds or notes may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the corporation determines.  Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the corporation may issue interim receipts or certificates which shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any resolution or resolutions authorizing any revenue bonds or any issue of revenue bonds may contain provisions, which shall be a part of the contract with the holders of the revenue bonds to be authorized, as to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Pledging all or any part of the revenues of a project or any revenue producing contract or contracts made by the corporation with any individual, partnership, corporation, or association or other body, public or private, to secure the payment of the revenue bonds or of any particular issue of revenue bonds, subject to such agreements with bondholders as then exist;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Limitations on the issuance of additional bonds;  the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured;  the refunding of outstanding bonds;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Limitations on the amount of moneys derived from the project to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of the corporation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Defining the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the duties of the corporation to holders of its obligations and providing the rights and remedies of such holders in the event of a default;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The mortgaging of a project and the site thereof for the purpose of securing the bondholders;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Such other additional covenants, agreements, and provisions as are judged desirable or necessary by the corporation for the security of the holders of such bonds.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Neither the members of the corporation nor any person executing the revenue bonds or notes shall be liable personally on the revenue bonds or notes or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The corporation has the power, out of any funds available therefor, to purchase its bonds or notes.  The corporation may hold, pledge, cancel, or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.

In the discretion of the corporation, any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the corporation and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state.  Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such revenue bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received or proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged and may convey or mortgage the project or any portion thereof.  Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such revenue bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as are reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including particularly such provisions as have been specifically authorized in this chapter to be included in any resolution or resolutions of the corporation authorizing revenue bonds thereof.  It is lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the corporation.  Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.  In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the corporation judges reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.  All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a project.

<codesect>
The corporation is authorized to fix, revise, charge, and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by each project and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation, or other body, public or private, in respect thereof.  Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues, if any, (a) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the project and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the corporation has not otherwise adequately provided for the payment thereof, (b) to pay the principal of and the interest on outstanding revenue bonds of the corporation issued in respect of such project as the same become due and payable, and (c) to create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such revenue bonds of the corporation.  Such rates, rents, fees, and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of the state other than the corporation.  A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements, and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the corporation or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds as the same become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided.  Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made;  the rates, rents, fees and charges, and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the corporation are immediately subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the corporation, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.  Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the corporation.  The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement.  Except as otherwise provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund shall be a fund for all such revenue bonds issued to finance projects at a particular participating institution without distinction or priority of one over another.  However, the corporation in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such sinking or other similar fund shall be the fund for a particular project at a participating institution and for the revenue bonds issued to finance a particular project and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of revenue bonds having a subordinate lien in respect of the security herein authorized to other revenue bonds of the corporation and, in such case, the corporation may create separate sinking or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.

The exercise of the powers granted by this chapter will be in all respects for the benefit of the people of the state, for the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and will constitute the performance of an essential governmental function, and neither the corporation nor its agent shall or may be required to pay any taxes or assessment upon or in respect of a project or any property acquired or used by the corporation or its agent or under the jurisdiction, control, possession or supervision of the same or upon the activities of the corporation or its agent in the operation or maintenance of the project under the provisions of this chapter, or upon income or other revenues received therefrom, and any bonds, notes and other obligations issued under the provisions of this chapter, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, as well as the income and property of the corporation, are at all times exempt from taxation of every kind by the state and by the municipalities and all other political subdivisions of the state;  provided that the participating institution shall be required to make annual payments in lieu of taxes on;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any project or any portion thereof owned by such participating institution or by the corporation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter if said project or any portion thereof would not be exempt from taxation pursuant to RSA 72:23 as amended and as in effect on the date that the findings of the designee of the governor and council are made for the particular project pursuant to RSA 195-D:21;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any portion or all of a project which provides permanent housing for married students, staff, or employees of a participating educational institution or permanent housing for staff, employees or relatives of patients of a participating health care institution.  The amount of the annual payment in lieu of taxes shall be equal to that sum which would otherwise have been payable for real estate taxes on such project or part thereof pursuant to RSA 74 and RSA 75.  All such payments in lieu of taxes shall be made to the city or town in which such project or portion thereof is located on December 1 of each year.  The corporation shall not be liable to make any such payments in lieu of taxes, except to the extent that moneys have been deposited with it for the specific purpose of making such payments in lieu of taxes.  The liability for such payments in lieu of taxes shall constitute a general obligation of the participating institution.  Upon any failure of such participating institution to make such payments in lieu of taxes as herein provided, no liens of any nature shall attach against any project, or any portion thereof, or against the assets or revenues of such participating institution, pledged to secure bonds or other obligations of the corporation for the period during which bonds or other obligations issued to finance the project are outstanding;  provided, however, the city or town shall have a lien to secure the making of such payments in lieu of taxes which lien shall attach against all real estate of the participating institution not pledged, mortgaged or otherwise encumbered to secure bonds or other obligations of the corporation and which lien shall further attach against all real estate comprising the project but only on the date the bonds or other obligations issued to finance such project or part thereof have been fully retired.  The corporation shall within 5 days of such date notify such city or town of the date on which the bonds or other obligations issued to finance the project or part thereof have been fully retired.  The city or town may enforce the foregoing liens by a collector's sale of property subject to such liens in the manner provided in RSA 80.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the governing body of such city or town, as defined in RSA 203:3, III, may agree with such participating institution to waive its rights to such payments in lieu of taxes, or any portion thereof, over the period during which bonds or other obligations issued to finance the project are outstanding or for some lesser period of time.

II. The proceeds of any such revenue bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding revenue bonds may, in the discretion of the corporation, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding revenue bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the corporation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, or in obligations of agencies of the United States of America, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, maturing at such time or times that are appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding revenue bonds to be so refunded.  The interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on any such investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding revenue bonds to be so refunded.  After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof may be returned to the corporation for use by it in any lawful manner.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the case of undertaking a project, the construction and acquisition of such project will enable or assist a participating educational institution to provide education within the state or a participating health care institution to provide health care facilities within the state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such project to be undertaken or a project to which the refinancing of existing indebtedness relates will be leased to, or owned by, a financially responsible participating institution within the state;  and

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Adequate provision has been, or will be, made for the payment of the cost of the construction and acquisition of such project to be undertaken or for the refinancing of existing indebtedness and that under no circumstances will the state be obligated directly or indirectly, for the payment of the principal of, or interest on, any obligations issued to finance such construction and acquisition or to provide for the refinancing of existing indebtedness, or obligations to which such refinancing of existing indebtedness relates;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Neither this chapter nor anything herein contained is or shall be construed as a restriction or limitation upon any powers which the New Hampshire health and education facilities authority might otherwise have under any laws of this state, and this chapter is cumulative of any such powers.
