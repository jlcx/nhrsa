<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Rules adopted by the board of education under RSA 200-C:15 shall include eligibility standards for participation in the program, provided no person with an annual income of over $17,000, after payment of all state and federal taxes and disability-related expenses specified by the board of education in the rules, shall be eligible for a full subsidy.  Persons whose annual income, after such taxes and such expenses, exceeds the limit for a full subsidy shall be eligible for subsidies which are reduced by  1/2 the amount their income exceeds such limit.  A person whose need for personal care assistance services exceeds the amount of the subsidy for which he is eligible may spend his own income for such services, and such expenditure shall be considered a disability-related expense for purposes of determining his income.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

III. When a person eligible for assistance under this section obtains employment which renders him ineligible for, or causes a reduction in services from, another program providing personal care assistance, the director shall ensure a smooth transition between the 2 programs so that personal care subsidies provided under this section shall commence immediately upon termination or reduction of services under the other program.
