<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the purpose of this chapter to increase educational opportunities within the state by encouraging the establishment of area schools in the receiving districts which will serve the receiving district and the sending districts throughout a natural social and economic region which has an adequate minimum taxable valuation and a number of pupils sufficient to permit efficient use of such area school facilities and to provide improved instruction.  The state board may formulate and adopt additional standards consistent with this purpose and these standards;  and the state board shall approve plans for the establishment of area schools only after determining that such establishment will be in accord with such standards and purposes set forth herein.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Geographical Plan.  The state board is authorized and directed to prepare and publish a plan subdividing the territory of the state into suggested regions for area schools indicating the suggested receiving district or districts for the schools of each region, which shall be compatible with the plan for suggested cooperative school districts, and which plan shall meet the standards formulated under paragraph I.  This plan shall be reasonably compatible with the areas of the several school administrative units.  From time to time thereafter the state board may modify such plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Advisory Powers of State Board.  The state board may prepare recommended forms of written plans for area schools and for enlargement of the areas served thereby and may furnish its advisory services to area school planning boards or school boards who have such matters under consideration.
