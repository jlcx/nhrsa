I. The school board of a school district located in proximity to an authorized regional enrollment area, which did not join the plan when it was initially established, may petition the school board of the receiving district of such area to join the area plan.  Thereupon it shall be the duty of the 2 school boards to engage in a joint study of the advisability thereof.  The 2 school boards acting jointly shall have all the powers of an area school planning board as provided in RSA 195-A:3 and may prepare and sign a written plan which shall contain such of the provisions required by RSA 195-A:3, V, as may be applicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An executed copy of the proposed plan shall be submitted by the joint board to the state board and thereafter the procedure shall be that prescribed in paragraphs VI, VII, VIII, IX and X of RSA 195-A:3;  provided, however, that such plan shall be submitted only to the voters of the receiving district and proposed new sending district and that prior public hearing thereon may be waived by the joint board.
