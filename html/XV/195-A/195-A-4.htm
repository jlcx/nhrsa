&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195-A:4 Application of School Laws. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
An area school shall be maintained and operated by the receiving district and its school board in accordance with all the general school laws applicable to schools of the grades which it includes, except only as otherwise provided in this chapter.  The receiving district shall be obligated to provide for the elementary or secondary school education, or both, of all the resident pupils of the sending districts as well as its own, in accordance with the approved regional plan as adopted under RSA 195-A:3.  The sending districts shall be obligated to assign and send their resident pupils to the area school, or schools, in the receiving district as provided in such plan and to raise and appropriate annually the tuition of each such pupil to be paid to the receiving district.  The liability to pay tuition may be enforced by the receiving district in an action of debt against a delinquent sending district to be commenced in the superior court for the county in which either district is located.  Transportation of resident pupils of the sending districts to the area school shall be governed by the general school laws applicable thereto and shall be the responsibility of each sending district.  An area school shall be deemed the assigned school for all resident pupils in the region which it is established to serve, for purposes of the school attendance laws, except as provided in RSA 193:3.
