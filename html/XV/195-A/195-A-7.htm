&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 195-A:7 Construction of Area Schools. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The construction of an area school including the purchase of school buildings, the construction of additions or alterations to existing buildings, the required new construction of such facilities during the life of the plan, the equipment thereof, and necessary land acquisition therefor, shall be the responsibility of the receiving district but it must, at all times, provide facilities of sufficient capacity to meet the estimated educational needs of the receiving and sending districts together.  A receiving district may borrow money for such purposes as provided in RSA 33 as amended.  However, in calculating whether it is within its debt limit, there shall be charged thereto an amount no greater than its proportionate share of any such required capital outlay, which shall be the proportion which its then estimated enrollment in the area school to be purchased, constructed or enlarged, bears to the then estimated total enrollment therein as determined by order of the state board.  Also in determining the debt limit of the receiving district this same proportion of its estimated enrollment in the area school shall apply to any indebtedness outstanding of the receiving district that existed at the time of the date of operating responsibility of the authorized regional enrollment area, when such indebtedness was incurred for facilities which are included in the area school plan.  The total amount of such bond or serial note issue shall be general obligations of the receiving district, fully secured by its powers of taxation.  Upon application of the school board of the receiving district, that amount of such bond or serial note issue, which is in excess of the proportionate share of the receiving district as determined by the state board, shall be eligible for state guarantee, either on a declining balance basis or as a separate issue fully guaranteed, as the governor and council may decide, in accordance with RSA 195-C.  The school board of the receiving district, without vote of the district, shall apply all tuition payments received from sending districts in each year first to the payment of the currently scheduled, or any past due, annual installments of principal or interest on that amount of such bond or serial note issue which is guaranteed by the state;  and only after adequate provision has been made therefor may any portion of such revenue be used for other purposes.
