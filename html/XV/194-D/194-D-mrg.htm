&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 194-D:2 Establishment;  Parental Choice;  Admission. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any school district legislative body may vote to designate one or more of its schools as an open enrollment school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Open enrollment schools shall operate under the same laws, rules, and policies as any other public school, except as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No public school, except a chartered public school, shall be required to be an open enrollment school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A school district may predetermine the number of pupils residing outside an open enrollment school's district or attendance area it deems appropriate to accept.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Applications may be made on behalf of eligible pupils to more than one open enrollment school within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every open enrollment school shall make available information about its curriculum and policies to all persons, and parents and pupils considering enrollment in that school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. There shall be no application fee for pupil admission to any open enrollment school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A pupil who meets the admission requirements of an open enrollment school, and who is a resident of the district where the school is located, shall be given absolute admission preference over a nonresident pupil.  Once admitted and unless expelled, open enrollment school pupils need not reapply for admission for subsequent years.

However, any added costs for such transportation services shall be borne by the open enrollment school.  For the purposes of open enrollment, neither the sending nor the receiving school district shall be obligated to provide transportation services for pupils attending an open enrollment school outside the pupil's resident district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<center><h3>Section 194-D:3</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 194-D:3 Procedure for Adoption and Rescission;  Limitations. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any school district may adopt the provisions of RSA 194-D, to adopt an open enrollment school program, in the following manner:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A question shall be placed on the warrant of a special or annual school district meeting which body shall have final authority to adopt the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) In districts without annual meetings, the legislative body of the school district shall consider and act upon the question in accordance with their current procedures.  To the extent and if permitted by local ordinance, upon submission to the legislative body within 60 days of the legislative body's vote of a petition signed by 100 or by 2 percent, whichever is less, of the registered voters, the legislative body shall place the question on the official ballot for any regular election otherwise in accordance with their current procedures for passage of referenda.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The school district legislative body shall hold a public hearing on the question at least 15 days but not more than 30 days before the question is to be voted on.  Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 2 public places in the municipality and published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 7 days before the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In the event that the referendum is nonbinding, the question shall be returned for reconsideration to the legislative body which shall have final authority to adopt the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) In the event that the referendum is binding, the public vote shall be the final and binding authority to adopt the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c)(1) In adopting the provisions of RSA 194-D, a school district shall impose limitations on the number of its resident pupils who may attend open enrollment schools located inside and outside the school district.  These limitations shall be represented as any percentage between zero and 100 percent of the school district's current pupil enrollment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In school districts with annual meetings, where no limitation question receives a majority vote, the limitations applying to the district shall be zero.  Where 2 or more conflicting adoption and/or limitation questions receive a majority vote, that combination of adoption and limitation provisions receiving a majority vote granting greatest latitude of parental choice shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) For all limitation questions, the school board shall propose a percentage limitation number.  The number may also be proposed by petition.  To change limitation percentages, a district need only act upon the relevant limitation questions.  Where no limitations are to be changed, no limitation questions shall be presented to the voters.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Adoption and limitation actions shall become effective on July 1 immediately following the action to adopt or limit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) A school district which has adopted any provisions of RSA 194-D may rescind its action or modify the limitations imposed in the manner described in paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If a majority of those voting vote to rescind the provisions of RSA 194-D or to reduce the percentages of pupils eligible to attend open enrollment schools, then as of July 1 next:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the percentage of pupils eligible for tuition to attend open enrollment schools in other districts is reduced, a resident pupil enrolled at a school outside the district shall continue to be eligible for tuition for the period necessary to complete the highest grade level offered by the school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the percentage of pupils eligible for tuition to attend open enrollment schools in the resident district is reduced, the resident district shall make alternate arrangements in accordance with RSA 189:1-a for the education of any affected pupil.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a host district rescinds its vote enabling the operation of an open enrollment school located in that district, the open enrollment school may retain its physical location and may continue to receive students and tuition from other districts if any sending district agrees to assume the responsibilities of the host district within 18 months of the effective date of the rescission.  The parent of a pupil attending that school may apply to any other open enrollment school eligible to receive pupils under the provisions of this chapter.  The pupil's sending district shall not be relieved of its obligation to educate that pupil in accordance with the district's policies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. This section shall apply to the establishment of each individual open enrollment school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon approval by each of the district's legislative bodies and after a public hearing, 2 or more school districts may consolidate otherwise eligible resident pupils into one applicant pool for the purposes of an admissions lottery for designated open enrollment schools.
