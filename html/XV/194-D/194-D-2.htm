<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any school district legislative body may vote to designate one or more of its schools as an open enrollment school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Open enrollment schools shall operate under the same laws, rules, and policies as any other public school, except as provided in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No public school, except a chartered public school, shall be required to be an open enrollment school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A school district may predetermine the number of pupils residing outside an open enrollment school's district or attendance area it deems appropriate to accept.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Applications may be made on behalf of eligible pupils to more than one open enrollment school within the state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every open enrollment school shall make available information about its curriculum and policies to all persons, and parents and pupils considering enrollment in that school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. There shall be no application fee for pupil admission to any open enrollment school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A pupil who meets the admission requirements of an open enrollment school, and who is a resident of the district where the school is located, shall be given absolute admission preference over a nonresident pupil.  Once admitted and unless expelled, open enrollment school pupils need not reapply for admission for subsequent years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. Attendance at an open enrollment school for the purposes of transportation shall not constitute assignment under the provisions of RSA 189:6 and RSA 189:8.  Pupils who reside in the school district in which the open enrollment school is located shall be provided transportation to that school by the district on the same terms and conditions as provided for in RSA 189:6 and RSA 189:8 and that transportation is provided to pupils attending other public schools within that district.  However, any added costs for such transportation services shall be borne by the open enrollment school.  For the purposes of open enrollment, neither the sending nor the receiving school district shall be obligated to provide transportation services for pupils attending an open enrollment school outside the pupil's resident district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. Upon approval by each of the district's legislative bodies and after a public hearing, 2 or more school districts may consolidate otherwise eligible resident pupils into one applicant pool for the purposes of an admissions lottery for designated open enrollment schools.
