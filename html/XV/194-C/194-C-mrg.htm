The school administrative unit board shall apportion the total amount of the budget among the constituent school districts in the following manner:  the apportionment shall be based  1/2 on the average membership in attendance for the previous school year and  1/2 on the most recently available equalized valuation of each district as of June 30 of the preceding school year.  Prior to January 15 in each year, the board shall certify to the chairperson of the school board of each constituent school district the amount so apportioned.  Each district within a school administrative unit shall raise at the next annual district meeting the sum of money apportioned to it by the school administrative unit board for the expenses of services which each district received in connection with the school administrative unit office.  The school administrative unit board in adopting the budget shall not add any new service to the school administrative unit budget unless a majority of the school districts in the school administrative unit representing not less than 60 percent of the total pupils in the school administrative unit have voted favorably upon the establishment of the service.
