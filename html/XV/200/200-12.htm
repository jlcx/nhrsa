<codesect>
If the department of health and human services shall find that such schoolhouse or building is in any respect a menace, or likely to become a menace, to the health or bodily welfare of the pupils or teachers, the department shall call the attention of the local board of health to the facts;  and, if after a reasonable length of time the complaint has not been attended to in a satisfactory way, the department shall either order such changes as will in their judgment make the building safe and sanitary for school purposes or condemn the same and forbid its further use.
