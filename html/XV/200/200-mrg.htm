<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The school principal, or designee shall annually investigate the air quality of any schoolhouse or building used for school purposes using a checklist provided by the department of education.  The checklist shall be established in rules adopted by the state board of education pursuant to RSA 541-A.

The review shall require a physical assessment of the facilities, not a measurement of the air quality.  The checklist shall allow an evaluation of the following physical conditions that can impact air quality:  general cleanliness, ventilation, moisture control, and chemical use and storage.  The completed checklist shall be filed after the annual inspection with the department of education, the local school board, and the local health officer.  Checklists shall remain on file for 5 years.  Checklists shall be reviewed during the 5 year school approval process and shall be a factor in the approval process for a public school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The department of education shall ensure that every public school in New Hampshire possesses a copy of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Tools for Schools program and shall encourage public schools to implement the program to help provide and maintain good indoor air quality in public school buildings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
