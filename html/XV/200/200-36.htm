<codesect>
All school personnel, to include but not limited to administrative, secretarial, maintenance, cafeteria and transportation personnel in each school district shall be required to have a pre-employment medical examination by a licensed physician qualified to practice medicine in at least one of the states of the United States of America.  Any person who objects to all or part of any medical examination because of religious beliefs shall be exempt from said examination, except that no such exemption shall be granted if state or local authorities determine that such exemption would constitute a hazard to the health of persons exposed to the unexamined individual.  The local school board shall further require additional medical examinations at specific intervals or upon the request of the local superintendent of schools during the period of employment.  A written recommendation from the examining physician shall indicate that the employee is medically capable of performing his designated assignment.
