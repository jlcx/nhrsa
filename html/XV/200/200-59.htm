&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The parent or legal guardian of any student who is identified by the public school as having characteristics that are associated with potential indicators or risk factors of dyslexia and related disorders shall be notified and provided with all screening information and findings, in addition to periodic formal screening results based on individual written intervention and support plans developed with the student's parents or legal guardian.

A parent or legal guardian of any student who is identified as having characteristics that are associated with potential indicators or risk factors of dyslexia and related disorders has the right to submit the results of an independent evaluation from a licensed reading or intervention specialist highly trained in dyslexia and related disorders for consideration by the student's school district.
