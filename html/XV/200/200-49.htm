<codesect>
Education is the key to identification and appropriate management of all concussions.  The school board of each school district is encouraged to develop guidelines and other pertinent information and forms for student sports to inform and educate coaches, student-athletes, and student-athletes' parents or guardians of the nature and risk of concussion and head injury including continuing to play after concussion or head injury.  On an annual basis, a school district or school is encouraged to distribute a concussion and head injury information sheet to all student-athletes.
