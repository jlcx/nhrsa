Education is the key to identification and appropriate management of all concussions.  The school board of each school district shall develop guidelines and other pertinent information and forms for student sports to inform and educate coaches, student-athletes, and student-athletes' parents or guardians of the nature and risk of concussion and head injury including continuing to play after concussion or head injury.  On an annual basis, a school district or school shall distribute a concussion and head injury information sheet to all student-athletes.  The Brain Injury Association of New Hampshire is available to educate and assist the public with implementing and/or updating concussion management protocols.
