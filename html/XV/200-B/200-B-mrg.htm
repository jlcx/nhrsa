<b>Procedure for Formation of an Interstate School District</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. Creation of Planning Committee.  The New Hampshire and Vermont commissioners of education shall have the power, acting jointly to constitute and discharge one or more interstate school district planning committees.  Each such planning committee shall consist of at least 2 voters from each of a group of 2 or more neighboring member districts.  One of the representatives from each member district shall be a member of its school board, whose term on the planning committee shall be concurrent with his term as a school board member.  The term of each member of a planning committee who is not also a school board member shall expire on June 30 of the third year following his appointment.  The existence of any planning committee may be terminated either by vote of a majority of its members or by joint action of the commissioners.  In forming and appointing members to an interstate school district planning board, the commissioners shall consider and take into account recommendations and nominations made by school boards of member districts.  No member of a planning committee shall be disqualified because he is at the same time a member of another planning board or committee created under the provisions of this compact or under any other provisions of law.  Any existing informal interstate school planning committee may be reconstituted as a formal planning committee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and its previous deliberations adopted and ratified by the reorganized formal planning committee.  Vacancies on a planning committee shall be filled by the commissioners acting jointly.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. Operating Procedures of Planning Committee.  Each interstate school district planning committee shall meet in the first instance at the call of any member, and shall organize by the election of a chairman and clerk-treasurer, each of whom shall be a resident of a different state.  Subsequent meetings may be called by either officer of the committee.  The members of the committee shall serve without pay.  The member districts shall appropriate money on an equal basis at each annual meeting to meet the expenses of the committee, including the cost of publication and distribution of reports and advertising.  From time to time the commissioners may add additional members and additional member districts to the committee, and may remove members and member districts from the committee.  An interstate school district planning committee shall act by majority vote of its membership present and voting.
<br>

C. Duties of Interstate School District Planning Committee.  It shall be the duty of an interstate school district planning committee, in consultation with the commissioners and the state departments of education:  to study the advisability of establishing an interstate school district in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph A of article I of this compact, its organization, operation and control, and the advisability of constructing, maintaining and operating a school or schools to serve the needs of such interstate district;  to estimate the construction and operating costs thereof;  to investigate the methods of financing such school or schools, and any other matters pertaining to the organization and operation of an interstate school district;  and to submit a report or reports of its findings and recommendations to the several member districts.

E. Hearings.  If the planning committee recommends the formation of an interstate school district, it shall hold at least one public hearing on its report and the proposed articles of agreement within the proposed interstate school district in New Hampshire, and at least one public hearing thereon within the proposed interstate school district in Vermont.  The planning committee shall give such notice thereof as it may determine to be reasonable, provided that such notice shall include at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the proposed interstate school district not less than 15 days (not counting the date of publication and not counting the date of the hearing) before the date of the first hearing.  Such hearings may be adjourned from time to time and from place to place.  The planning committee may revise the proposed articles of agreement after the date of the hearings.  It shall not be required to hold further hearings on the revised articles of agreement but may hold one or more further hearings after notice similar to that required for the first hearings if the planning committee in its sole discretion determines that the revisions are so substantial in nature as to require further presentation to the public before submission to the state boards of education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
F. Approval by State Boards.  After the hearings a copy of the proposed articles of agreement, as revised, signed by a majority of the planning committee, shall be submitted by it to each state board.  The state boards may (a) if they find that the articles of agreement are in accord with the standards set forth in this compact and in accordance with sound educational policy, approve the same as submitted, or (b) refer them back to the planning committee for further study.  The planning committee may make additional revisions to the proposed articles of agreement to conform to the recommendations of the state boards.  Further hearings on the proposed articles of agreement shall not be required unless ordered by the state boards in their discretion.  In exercising such discretion, the state boards shall take into account whether or not the additional revisions are so substantial in nature as to require further presentation to the public.  If both state boards find that the articles of agreement as further revised are in accord with the standards set forth in this compact and in accordance with sound educational policy, they shall approve the same.  After approval by both state boards, each state board shall cause the articles of agreement to be submitted to the school boards of the several member districts in each state for acceptance by the member districts as provided in paragraph G of this article.  At the same time, each state board shall designate the form of warrant, date, time, place, and period of voting for the special meeting of the member district to be held in accordance with paragraph G of this article.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
G. Adoption by Member Districts.  Upon receipt of written notice from the state board in its state of the approval of the articles of agreement by both state boards, the school board of each member district shall cause the articles of agreement to be filed with the member district clerk.  Within 10 days after receipt of such notice, the school board shall issue its warrant for a special meeting of the member district, the warrant to be in the form, and the meeting to be held at the time and place and in the manner prescribed by the state board.  No approval of the superior court shall be required for such special school district meeting in New Hampshire.  Voting shall be with the use of the checklist by a ballot substantially in the following form:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"Shall the school district accept the provisions of the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact providing for the establishment of an interstate school district, together with the school districts of __________ and __________ etc., in accordance with the provisions of the proposed articles of agreement filed with the school district (town, city or incorporated school district) clerk?''
<PRE>
 Yes ( ) No ( )
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If the articles of agreement included the nomination of individual school directors, those nominated from each member district shall be included in the ballot and voted upon, such election to become effective upon the formation of an interstate school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
If a majority of the voters present and voting in a member district vote in the affirmative, the clerk for such member district shall forthwith send to the state board in its state a certified copy of the warrant, certificate of posting, and minutes of the meeting of the district.  If the state boards of both states find that a majority of the voters present and voting in each member district have voted in favor of the establishment of the interstate school district, they shall issue a joint certificate to that effect;  and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the lawful organization and formation of the interstate school district as of its date of issuance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
H. Resubmission.  If the proposed articles of agreement are adopted by one or more of the member districts but rejected by one or more of the member districts, the state boards may resubmit them, in the same form as previously submitted, to the rejecting member districts, in which case the school boards thereof shall resubmit them to the voters in accordance with paragraph G of this article.  An affirmative vote in accordance therewith shall have the same effect as though the articles of agreement had been adopted in the first instance.  In the alternative, the state boards may either (a) discharge the planning committee, or (b) refer the articles of agreement back for further consideration to the same or a reconstituted planning committee, which shall have all of the powers and duties of the planning committee as originally constituted.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Subject to the provisions of article VII hereof, the interstate board shall first apply against such appropriation any income to which the interstate district is entitled, and shall then apportion the balance among the member districts in accordance with one of the following formulas as determined by the articles of agreement as amended from time to time:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
a. All of such balance to be apportioned on the basis of the ratio that the fair market value of the taxable property in each member district bears to that of the entire interstate district;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
b. All of such balance to be apportioned on the basis that the average daily resident membership for the preceding fiscal year of each member district bears to that of the average daily resident membership of the entire interstate school district;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
c. A formula based on any combination of the foregoing factors.  The term "fair market value of taxable property'' shall mean the last locally assessed valuation of a member district in New Hampshire, as last equalized by the New Hampshire commissioner of revenue administration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The term "fair market value of taxable property'' shall mean the equalized grand list of a Vermont member district, as determined by the Vermont department of taxes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Such assessed valuation and grand list may be further adjusted (by elimination of certain types of taxable property from one or the other or otherwise) in accordance with the articles of agreement, in order that the fair market value of taxable property in each state shall be comparable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
"Average daily resident membership'' of the interstate district in the first instance shall be the sum of the average daily resident membership of the member districts in the grades involved for the preceding fiscal year where no students were enrolled in the interstate district schools for such preceding fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
D. Share of New Hampshire Member District.  The interstate board shall certify the share of a New Hampshire member district of the total appropriation to the school board of each member district which shall add such sum to the amount appropriated by the member district itself for the ensuing year and raise such sum in the same manner as though the appropriation had been voted at a school district meeting of the member district.  The interstate district shall not set up its own capital reserve funds;  but a New Hampshire member district may set up a capital reserve fund in accordance with RSA 35, to be turned over to the interstate district in payment of the New Hampshire member district's share of any anticipated obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
E. Share of Vermont Member District.

<p>
<b>Article VII</b>
</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>
<b>Borrowing</b>
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
A. Interstate District Indebtedness.  Indebtedness of an interstate district shall be a general obligation of the district and shall also be a joint and several general obligation of each member district, except that such obligations of the district and its member district shall not be deemed indebtedness of any member district for the purposes of determining its borrowing capacity under New Hampshire or Vermont law.  A member district which withdraws from an interstate district shall remain liable for indebtedness of the interstate district which is outstanding at the time of withdrawal and shall be responsible for paying its share of such indebtedness to the same extent as though it had not withdrawn.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
B. Temporary Borrowing.  The interstate board may authorize the borrowing of money by the interstate district (1) in anticipation of payments of operating and capital expenses by the member districts to the interstate district and (2) in anticipation of the issue of bonds or notes of the interstate district which have been authorized for the purpose of financing capital projects.  Such temporary borrowing shall be evidenced by interest-bearing or discounted notes of the interstate district.  The amount of notes issued in any fiscal year in anticipation of expense payments shall not exceed the amount of such payments received by the interstate district in the preceding fiscal year.  Notes issued under this paragraph shall be payable within one year in the case of notes under clause (1) and 3 years in the case of notes under clause (2) from their respective dates, but the principal of and interest on notes issued for a shorter period may be renewed or paid from time to time by the issue of other notes, provided that the period from the date of an original note to the maturity of any note issued to renew or pay the same debt shall not exceed the maximum period permitted for the original loan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
C. Borrowing for Capital Projects.  An interstate district may incur debt and issue its bonds or notes to finance capital projects.  Such projects may consist of the acquisition or improvement of land and buildings for school purposes, the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or enlargement of school buildings and related school facilities, the acquisition of equipment of a lasting character and the payment of judgments.  No interstate district may authorize indebtedness in excess of 10 percent of the total fair market value of taxable property in its member districts as defined in article VI of this compact.  The primary obligation of the interstate district to pay indebtedness of member districts shall not be considered indebtedness of the interstate district for the purpose of determining its borrowing capacity under this paragraph.  Bonds or notes issued under this paragraph shall mature in equal or diminishing installments of principal payable at least annually commencing no later than 2 years and ending not later than 30 years after their dates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
D. Authorization Proceedings.  An interstate district shall authorize the incurring of debts to finance capital projects by a majority vote of the district passed at an annual or special district meeting.  Such vote shall be taken by secret ballot after full opportunity for debate, and any such vote shall be subject to reconsideration and further action by the district at the same meeting or at an adjourned session thereof.  As an alternative, an interstate district may provide in its articles of agreement that such a vote be conducted by Australian or official balloting under procedures set forth in the articles of agreement, and that such vote be subject to any method of reconsideration, if any, which the interstate district sets forth in the articles of agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
E. Sale of Bonds and Notes.  Bonds and notes which have been authorized under this article may be issued from time to time and shall be sold at not less than par and accrued interest at public or private sale by the chairman of the school board and by the treasurer.  Interstate district bonds and notes shall be signed by the said officers, except that either one of the 2 required signatures may be a facsimile.  Subject to this compact and the authorizing vote, they shall be in such form, bear such rates of interest and mature at such times as the said officers may determine.  Bonds shall, but notes need not, bear the seal of the interstate district, or a facsimile of such seal.  Any bonds or notes of the interstate district which are properly executed by the said officers shall be valid and binding according to their terms notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof such officers may have ceased to be officers of the interstate district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
F. Proceeds of Bonds.  Any accrued interest received upon delivery of bonds or notes of an interstate district shall be applied to the payment of the first interest which becomes due thereon.  The other proceeds of the sale of such bonds or notes, other than temporary notes, including any premiums, may be temporarily invested by the interstate district pending their expenditure;  and such proceeds, including any income derived from the temporary investment of such proceeds, shall be used to pay the costs of issuing and marketing the bonds or notes and to meet the operating expenses or capital expenses in accordance with the purposes for which the bonds or notes were issued or, by proceedings taken in the manner required for the authorization of such debt, for other purposes for which such debt could be incurred.  No purchaser of any bonds or notes of an interstate district shall be responsible in any way to see to the application of the proceeds thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
G. State Aid Programs.  As used in this paragraph the term "initial aid'' shall include New Hampshire and Vermont financial assistance with respect to a capital project, or the means of financing a capital project, which is available in connection with construction costs of a capital project or which is available at the time indebtedness is incurred to finance the project.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition, initial aid shall specifically include a New Hampshire state guarantee under RSA 195-C with respect to bonds or notes and Vermont construction aid under chapter 123 of 16 V.S.A. As used in this paragraph the term "long-term aid'' shall include New Hampshire and Vermont financial assistance which is payable periodically in relation to capital costs incurred by an interstate district.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition, long-term aid shall specifically include New Hampshire school building aid under RSA 198 and Vermont school building aid under chapter 123 of Title 16 V.S.A. For the purpose of applying for, receiving and expending initial aid and long-term aid an interstate district shall be deemed a native school district by each state, subject to the following provisions.  When an interstate district has appropriated money for a capital project, the amount appropriated shall be divided into a New Hampshire share and a Vermont share in accordance with the capital expense apportionment formula in the articles of agreement as though the total amount appropriated for the project was a capital expense requiring apportionment in the year the appropriation is made.  New Hampshire initial aid shall be available with respect to the amount of the New Hampshire share as though it were authorized indebtedness of a New Hampshire cooperative school district.  In the case of a state guarantee of interstate district bonds or notes under RSA 195-C, the interstate district shall be eligible to apply for and receive an unconditional state guarantee with respect to an amount of its bonds or notes which does not exceed 50 percent of the amount of the New Hampshire share as determined above.  Vermont initial aid shall be available with respect to the amount of the Vermont share as though it were funds voted by a Vermont school district.  Payments of Vermont initial aid shall be made to the interstate district, and the amount of any borrowing authorized to meet the appropriation for the capital project shall be reduced accordingly.  New Hampshire and Vermont long-term aid shall be payable to the interstate district.  The amounts of long-term aid in each year shall be based on the New Hampshire and Vermont shares of the amount of indebtedness of the interstate district which is payable in that year and which has been apportioned in accordance with the capital expense apportionment formula in the articles of agreement.  The New Hampshire aid shall be payable at the rate of 45 percent, if there are 3 or less New Hampshire members in the interstate district, and otherwise it shall be payable as though the New Hampshire members were a New Hampshire cooperative school district.  New Hampshire and Vermont long-term aid shall be deducted from the total capital expenses for the fiscal year in which the long-term aid is payable, and the balance of such expenses shall be apportioned among the member districts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, New Hampshire and Vermont may at any time change their state school aid programs that are in existence when this compact takes effect and may establish new programs, and any legislation for these purposes may specify how such programs shall be applied with respect to interstate districts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the respective amounts of New Hampshire and Vermont initial and long-term aid, with respect to a capital project of the Dresden School District for which indebtedness is authorized by a vote of the district after July 1, 1977, shall be initially determined for each year for each member district by the manner provided in this paragraph and the aid shall be paid to the Dresden School District;  however, the amount of aid for those capital projects received by the Dresden School District on account of each member district shall be used by the District to reduce the sums which would otherwise be required to be raised by taxation within that member district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
H. Tax Exemption.  Bonds and notes of an interstate school district shall be exempt from local property taxes in both states, and the interest or discount thereon and any profit derived from the disposition thereof shall be exempt from personal income taxes in both states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding paragraph G of this article, initial and long-term aid may be allocated among the members of an interstate district other than the Dresden School District in the manner which is provided in the articles of agreement of that district, or if not therein provided, in the manner specified in paragraph G for all interstate districts other than the Dresden School District.
