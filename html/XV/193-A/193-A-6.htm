I. The parent shall maintain a portfolio of records and materials relative to the home education program.  The portfolio shall consist of a log which designates by title the reading materials used, and also samples of writings, worksheets, workbooks, or creative materials used or developed by the child.  Such portfolio shall be preserved by the parent for 2 years from the date of the ending of the instruction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The parent shall provide for an annual educational evaluation in which is documented the child's demonstration of educational progress at a level commensurate with the child's age and ability.  The child shall be deemed to have successfully completed his annual evaluation upon meeting the requirements of any one of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A certified teacher or a teacher currently teaching in a nonpublic school who is selected by the parent shall evaluate the child's educational progress upon review of the portfolio and discussion with the parent or child;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The child shall take any national student achievement test, administered by a person who meets the qualifications established by the provider or publisher of the test.  Composite results at or above the fortieth percentile on such tests shall be deemed reasonable academic proficiency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The child shall take a state student assessment test used by the resident district.  Composite results at or above the fortieth percentile on such state test shall be deemed reasonable academic proficiency;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The child shall be evaluated using any other valid measurement tool mutually agreed upon by the parent and the commissioner of education, resident district superintendent, or nonpublic school principal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The parent shall maintain a copy of the evaluation.  The results of the evaluation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) May be used to demonstrate the child's academic proficiency in order to participate in public school programs, and co-curricular activities which are defined as school district-sponsored and directed athletics, fine arts, and academic activities.  Home educated students shall be subject to the same participation policy and eligibility conditions as apply to public school students.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Shall not be used as a basis for termination of a home education program.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provides a basis for a constructive relationship between the parent and the evaluator, both working together in the best interest of the child.
