&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 197:3 Raising Money at Special Meeting. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) No school district at any special meeting shall raise or appropriate money nor reduce or rescind any appropriation made at a previous meeting, unless the vote thereon is by ballot, nor unless the ballots cast at such meeting shall be equal in number to at least  1/2 of the number of voters of such district entitled to vote at the regular meeting next preceding such special meeting;  and, if a checklist was used at the last preceding regular meeting, the same shall be used to ascertain the number of legal voters in said district;  and such checklist, corrected according to law, may be used at such special meeting upon request of 10 legal voters of the district.  In case an emergency arises requiring an immediate expenditure of money, the school board may petition the superior court for permission to hold a special district meeting, which, if granted, shall give said district meeting the same authority as an annual district meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Emergency'' for the purposes of this section shall mean a sudden or unexpected situation or occurrence, or combination of occurrences, of a serious and urgent nature, that demands prompt or immediate action, including an immediate expenditure of money.  This definition, however, does not establish a requirement that an emergency involves a crisis in every set of circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) To verify that an emergency exists, a petitioner shall present, and the court shall consider, a number of factors including:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The severity of the harm to be avoided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The urgency of the petitioner's need.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Whether the claimed emergency was foreseeable or avoidable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Whether the appropriation could have been made at the annual meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Whether there are alternative remedies not requiring an appropriation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Ten days prior to petitioning the superior court, the school board shall notify, by certified mail, the commissioner of the department of revenue administration that an emergency exists by providing the commissioner with a copy of the explanation of the emergency, the warrant article or articles and the petition to be submitted to the superior court.  The petition to the superior court shall include a certification that the commissioner of the department of revenue administration has been notified pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the event that the legislative body at an annual meeting amends or rejects the cost items or fact finder's reports as submitted pursuant to RSA 273-A, notwithstanding paragraphs I and II, the school board may call one special meeting for the sole purpose of addressing all negotiated cost items without petitioning the superior court for authorization.  Such special meeting may be authorized only by a contingent warrant article inserted on the warrant or official ballot either by petition or by the governing body.  The wording of the question shall be as follows:  "Shall (the local political subdivision), if article __________ is defeated, authorize the governing body to call one special meeting, at its option, to address article __________ cost items only?''  The refusal of the legislative body to authorize a special meeting as provided in this paragraph shall not affect any other provision of law.  Any special meeting held under this paragraph shall be combined with the revised operating budget meeting under RSA 40:13, XI, if any, and shall not be counted toward the number of special meetings which may be held in a given calendar or fiscal year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. When the school board votes to petition the superior court for permission to hold a special school district meeting, the school board shall post notice of such vote within 24 hours after taking the vote and a minimum of 10 days prior to filing the petition with the court.  The school board shall post notice of the court date for an evidentiary hearing on the petition within 24 hours after receiving notice of the court date from the court.  Such notices shall be posted at the office of the school board and at 2 or more other conspicuous places in the school district, and in the next available edition of one or more local newspapers with a wide circulation in the school district.  If the district is a multi-town school district, the notices shall be posted at the office of the school board and at 2 or more other conspicuous places in each town of the multi-town school district, and in the next available edition of one or more newspapers with a wide circulation in all towns of the multi-town school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no special meeting to raise and appropriate money, or to reduce or rescind any appropriation made at a previous meeting, may be held unless the vote is taken on or before December 31 of any budget cycle.  However, the district may bring such items as could not be addressed prior to December 31 before the voters at the next annual school district meeting.  Such supplemental appropriations, together with appropriations raised under RSA 197:1, shall be assessed against property as of April 1.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The governing body of a school district that has adopted the official ballot referendum form of meeting under RSA 40:13 may elect to hold and conduct the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this section in a single session for deliberating and voting, and without regard to the provisions of RSA 40:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The governing body's warrant shall specify, in one or more articles, the amounts of appropriations proposed for reduction, rescission, or increase from the operating budget or separate warrant articles, or both, adopted at the annual meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The governing body shall hold a public hearing on the proposed reductions, rescissions, or increase at least 14 days prior to the meeting.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The governing body of such school district shall post a notice of the meeting, which shall include the warrant, in at least 2 public places within the school district, one of which shall be on the school district's website, if such exists, at least 7 days prior to the meeting.  Additional notice shall be published in a newspaper of local or regional circulation in the school district, provided that if there is no newspaper of local or regional circulation in which notice can be published at least 7 days before the date of the meeting, public notice shall be posted in at least one additional place within the school district.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The meeting shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section.  The most recently updated checklist shall be used.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The legislative body may approve or disapprove any proposed reduction, rescission, or increase of appropriations, or may approve lesser reductions.  The legislative body shall not approve greater reductions than what is in the warrant, or reduce or rescind an appropriation not specified in the warrant, or act on any other business at the meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Except as provided in this section, the provisions of the following chapters, as they apply to special meetings of the legislative body of a school district, shall not be required for special meetings held pursuant to this paragraph:  RSA 32, RSA 39, RSA 49-D, RSA 197, RSA 654, RSA 669, RSA 670, and RSA 671.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The treasurer shall have custody of all moneys belonging to the district and shall pay out the same only upon orders of the school board or upon orders of the 2 or more members of the school board empowered by the school board as a whole to authorize payments.  The treasurer shall deposit the moneys in participation units in the public deposit investment pool established pursuant to RSA 383:22, or in federally insured banks chartered under the laws of New Hampshire or the federal government with a branch within the state, except that funds may be deposited in banks outside the state if such banks pledge and deliver to a third party custodial bank or the regional federal reserve bank collateral security for such deposits of the following types:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) United States government obligations,
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) United States government agency obligations;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Obligations of the state of New Hampshire in value at least equal to the amount of the deposit in each case.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The amount of collected funds on deposit in any one bank shall not at any time exceed the sum of its paid-up capital and surplus.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The treasurer shall keep in suitable books provided for the purpose a fair and correct account of all sums received into and paid from the district treasury, and of all notes given by the district, with the particulars thereof.  At the close of each fiscal year, the treasurer shall make a report to the district, giving a particular account of all of the treasurer's financial transactions during the year.  The treasurer shall furnish to the school board statements from the books, and submit the books and vouchers to them and to the auditors for examination, whenever so requested.
<center>
<p>
[Paragraph IV effective until October 1, 2015;  see also paragraph IV set out below.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Whenever the treasurer has in custody an excess of funds which are not immediately needed for the purpose of expenditure, the treasurer shall, with the approval of the school board, invest the same in participation units in the public deposit investment pool established pursuant to RSA 383:22, or in deposits, including money market accounts, or certificates of deposit, or repurchase agreements, and all other types of interest bearing accounts, of federally insured banks incorporated under the laws of the state of New Hampshire or the federal government with a branch within the state and in obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States government.  The obligations may be held directly or in the form of securities of or other interests in any open-end or closed-end management-type investment company or investment trust registered under 15 U.S.C. section 80a-1 et seq., if the portfolio of the investment company or investment trust is limited to such obligations and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such obligations.  Any person who directly or indirectly receives any such funds for deposit or for investment in securities of any kind shall, prior to acceptance of such funds, make available at the time of such deposit or investment an option to have such funds secured by collateral having a value at least equal to the amount of such funds.  Such collateral shall be segregated for the exclusive benefit of the district.  Only securities defined by the bank commissioner as provided by rules adopted pursuant to RSA 386:57 shall be eligible to be pledged as collateral.  At least yearly, the school board shall review and adopt an investment policy for the investment of public funds in conformance with the provisions of applicable statutes.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The selected bank arranges for the redeposit of funds which exceed the federal deposit insurance limitation of the selected bank in deposits in one or more federally insured financial institutions located in the United States, for the account of the treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The full amount of principal and any accrued interest of each such deposit is covered by federal deposit insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The selected bank acts as custodian with respect to each such deposit for the account of the treasurer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) On the same date that the funds are redeposited by the selected bank, the selected bank receives an amount of deposits from customers of other federally insured financial institutions equal to or greater than the amount of the funds initially invested through the selected bank by the treasurer.
