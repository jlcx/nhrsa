&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the policy of the state of New Hampshire that public elementary and secondary education shall provide all students with the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to prepare them for successful participation in the social, economic, scientific, technological, and political systems of a free government, now and in the years to come;  an education that is consistent with the minimum standards for public school approval, the state-established academic standards, and school district or school curriculum.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Respecting New Hampshire's long tradition of community involvement, it is the purpose of this chapter to ensure that appropriate means are established to provide an adequate education through an integrated system of shared responsibility between state and local government.  In this system, the state establishes minimum standards for public school approval and academic standards for inclusion and delivery of educational services at the local level.  School districts then have responsibility and flexibility in implementing diverse educational approaches to instruction and curriculum tailored to meet student needs.
