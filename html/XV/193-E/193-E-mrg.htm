&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193-E:1 Policy and Purpose. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the policy of the state of New Hampshire that public elementary and secondary education shall provide all students with the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to prepare them for successful participation in the social, economic, scientific, technological, and political systems of a free government, now and in the years to come;  an education that is consistent with the minimum standards for public school approval, the state-established academic standards, and school district or school curriculum.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Respecting New Hampshire's long tradition of community involvement, it is the purpose of this chapter to ensure that appropriate means are established to provide an adequate education through an integrated system of shared responsibility between state and local government.  In this system, the state establishes minimum standards for public school approval and academic standards for inclusion and delivery of educational services at the local level.  School districts then have responsibility and flexibility in implementing diverse educational approaches to instruction and curriculum tailored to meet student needs.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The department of education shall, using federal funds only, implement and maintain a unique pupil identification system on a statewide basis that complies with the following requirements:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) No personally identifiable information about a pupil including name and social security number, shall be collected or maintained by the state in such a manner as to allow such information to be connected with the unique pupil identifier.  Under no circumstances shall the department of education obtain or use a social security number as an identifier for any pupil.  The department shall not use unique pupil identifiers except in connection with the data warehouse and such use shall not be accessible to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The random number generator shall make available to each early childhood program, district, or postsecondary institution a unique pupil identifier for each pupil pursuing an education in a New Hampshire early childhood program, district, or postsecondary institution.  The unique pupil identifier itself shall not permit pupil identification within a subcategory including, but not limited to, early childhood program, district, postsecondary institution, sex, age, grade, or county of residence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The unique pupil identifier shall be requested and maintained by the early childhood program, district, or postsecondary institution.  The unique pupil identifier shall remain in the pupil's file throughout his or her academic career in New Hampshire.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Any person who knowingly violates the provisions of this subparagraph is guilty of a class B felony and may be subject to involuntary termination of employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The random number generator shall create and maintain a comprehensive audit trail for all users accessing the random number generator.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The information maintained in the data warehouse shall be available to the department of education and to the public using the data maintained by the department of education.  No personally identifiable information shall be required as a condition of access or usage under this subparagraph, nor shall such access or usage be tracked.  Under no circumstances shall the unique pupil identifier be made available to the public.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Information maintained in the random number generator shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) Authorized personnel at the department of education shall administer and maintain the unique pupil identification system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(l) The department of education shall provide no personally identifiable information collected pursuant to this chapter, including but not limited to name, date of birth, or social security number to any person or entity, other than an early childhood program, district, or postsecondary institution authorized to access this data, absent a court order.

(m) Early childhood programs not receiving Head Start or child care scholarship funds, private schools comprised of kindergarten through grade 12, and all private postsecondary institutions may participate in the data warehouse and random number generator.  Participating early childhood programs may volunteer to include data for pupils for which Head Start or child care scholarship funds are not received.  Permission of a parent or legal guardian of a pupil enrolled in an early childhood program shall be obtained before a pupil may participate in the data warehouse and random number generator.  For the purposes of this section, such voluntary participating early childhood programs shall be included in the definition set forth in RSA 193-E:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(n) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (a)-(m), to enable the department of education to ensure the accuracy of the data, the commissioner of the department of education may, in writing, grant individuals access to the data warehouse, including but not limited to, access to the unique pupil identifier for the purpose of connecting information in the warehouse with the random number generator.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(o) At the request of an early childhood program, school district, or postsecondary institution, the department of education shall provide pupil-level data from the unique pupil identification system to an early childhood program, school district, or postsecondary institution for pupils pursing an education in that entity.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in statute, the department shall not provide for any purpose any student personally-identifiable data to any public or private individual or entity, including the local, state, or federal government, or department or agency thereof, regardless of whether such individual or entity is for profit or not-for-profit, and regardless of whether the public or private individual or entity is involved in any way with the pupil's education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(p) New Hampshire home educated pupils pursing an education in a postsecondary institution who have not been assigned a unique pupil identifier may, without penalty, opt out of being included in the unique pupil identification system for postsecondary pupils.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(q) Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit institutions in the university system of New Hampshire and the community college system of New Hampshire from exchanging data between themselves without the consent or involvement of the department of education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding RSA 193-E:3, II, the legislative oversight committee established in RSA 193-C:7 shall perform any revisions to this section through legislation filed for that purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
