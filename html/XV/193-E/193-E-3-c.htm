III. The task force shall develop a performance-based scoring system using only the best available data and indicators which are already provided to the department and/or performance measures that schools are already required to provide the department under other state or federal law.

<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. No later than April 1, 2010, the task force shall submit an interim report of its findings and recommendations for future legislation for the performance-based accountability system to the chairpersons of the house and senate education committees, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the senate president.  After the interim report is reviewed by the house and senate education committees, the department shall verify the integrity, accuracy, and validity of the performance-based accountability system utilizing actual school data as provided in RSA 193-E:3-d and shall submit a final report no later than November 1, 2010, including recommendations for future legislation and legislative adoption of the performance-based accountability system, to the chairpersons of the house and senate education committees, the speaker of the house of representatives, the senate president, the governor, the house clerk, and the senate clerk.
