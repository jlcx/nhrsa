&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 193-E:3-b Accountability for the Opportunity for an Adequate Education. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Beginning with the 2009-2010 school year, a school shall demonstrate by the end of the school year that it provides the opportunity for an adequate education under RSA 193-E:2-a by meeting the requirements of subparagraphs I(a) and (b) of this section.  Beginning with the 2011-2012 school year, a school shall demonstrate, by the end of the school year, that it provides the opportunity for an adequate education by meeting the requirements of either paragraph I or II of this section.  Following the adoption of the performance-based accountability system as provided in RSA 193-E:3-c and RSA 193-E:3-d, the department shall evaluate all schools using both the input-based school accountability system under subparagraphs I(a) and (b) of this section and the performance-based accountability system under RSA 193-E:3-c and RSA 193-E:3-d.  A school that satisfies the requirements of either paragraph I or II shall be providing the opportunity for an adequate education.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) A school may demonstrate that it provides the opportunity for an adequate education as set forth in RSA 193-E:2-a by establishing that it meets the following input-based school accountability standards in effect as of the effective date of this section:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) The commissioner shall require school officials to submit a narrative explanation detailing how the school has complied with each of the standards included in the opportunity for an adequate education contained in subparagraph (a).  The school principal and school district superintendent shall certify in writing that the responses submitted are accurate.  The commissioner shall develop a form which conforms to the provisions of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The commissioner shall review the responses to each school's self-assessment required under this section and shall verify that the responses comply with the standards included in the opportunity for an adequate education specified under subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Schools that successfully demonstrate that they provide the opportunity for an adequate education through the input-based school accountability system for any year beginning with the 2009-2010 school year shall be required by the commissioner to resubmit the narrative explanations at least once every 2 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Schools that are unable to demonstrate that they provide the opportunity for an adequate education through the input-based school accountability system for the 2009-2010 school year, or for any year thereafter, shall be required by the commissioner to resubmit the narrative explanations annually until such demonstration has been made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The commissioner shall integrate, to the maximum extent practicable, the input-based school accountability system to demonstrate the opportunity for an adequate education with the school approval process pursuant to RSA 21-N:6, V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Beginning September 1, 2012, the department shall annually conduct site visits at 10 percent of schools statewide to assess the validity of the input-based school accountability system and to determine whether those schools demonstrate the opportunity for an adequate education by meeting the school standards identified in this paragraph.  To the extent feasible, the commissioner shall conduct these site visits together with other site visits conducted by the department for other purposes and programs.  The commissioner may require more frequent site visits at schools which have been unable to demonstrate that they provide the opportunity for an adequate education.  To the extent that the department conducts school site visits for other state and/or federal programs after the commencement of the 2009-2010 school year, but prior to September 1, 2012, the department shall, to the maximum extent practicable, endeavor to audit the input-based school accountability self-reporting completed by the visited school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A school that furnishes the commissioner with evidence that it has received full accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b).  The school shall submit to the commissioner copies of documentation necessary during the school's accreditation process including, but not limited to, the accreditation self-study report, peer review reports, reports of any follow-up activities taken by the school in response to NEASC's recommendations for accreditation, and the annual school update report as required by NEASC each fall.  In the fifth year of the 10-year accreditation, the school shall submit a progress report to the commissioner.  A school accredited by NEASC shall meet or exceed NEASC's standards and shall use those standards to measure improvement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Beginning with the 2011-2012 school year, a school may demonstrate by the end of the school year that it provides the opportunity for an adequate education through the performance-based school accountability system to be developed and implemented by the department, pursuant to RSA 193-E:3-c and RSA 193-E:3-d and designed to measure educational outcomes.
