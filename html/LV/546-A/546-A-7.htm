&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-A:7 Enforcement of Rights. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The obligee may enforce his right of support against the obligor and the state or any political subdivision thereof may proceed on behalf of the obligee to enforce his right of support against the obligor.  Whenever the state or a political subdivision thereof furnishes support to an obligee, it has the same right as the obligee to whom the support was furnished, for the purpose of securing reimbursement and of obtaining continuing support.
