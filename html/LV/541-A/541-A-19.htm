Failure to submit a written explanation in accordance with the conditional approval and this paragraph shall cause the conditional approval to be deemed a committee vote to make a preliminary objection on the date of the conditional approval.

The agency shall respond to a committee objection only once, and shall report its response in writing to the committee prior to its next regularly scheduled meeting.  Failure to respond to the committee in accordance with this subparagraph shall mean the rulemaking procedure for that proposed interim rule is invalid;  however, the agency is not precluded from initiating the process over again for a similar rule, provided the conditions in paragraph I are met.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(e) The committee shall review the response and vote to approve the response or continue the objection.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(f) The committee's objection shall not preclude the agency from adopting the substance of an interim rule by meeting the requirements of RSA 541-A:3.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIX. No proposed interim rule shall be adopted unless within 90 days of publication of the notice the committee votes to approve or conditionally approve the proposed interim rule.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX. No proposed interim rule shall be adopted unless the committee has voted to approve the proposed interim rule or conditionally approve the proposed interim rule, provided that the committee legal counsel has sent written confirmation to the agency pursuant to RSA 541-A:19, VIII(b). An adopted interim rule shall be filed with the director of legislative services no later than 30 days following committee approval or conditional approval.  An interim rule shall be effective under RSA 541-A:16, III on the day after filing with the director of legislative services, or at a later date, provided the agency so specifies in a letter to the director of legislative services and the effective date is within 30 days following committee approval or conditional approval.  Interim rules shall be effective for a period not to exceed 180 days.  During the time an interim rule shall be in effect, the agency may propose a permanent rule to replace the interim rule once it expires, but it shall not adopt another interim rule to replace the expiring interim rule.">
