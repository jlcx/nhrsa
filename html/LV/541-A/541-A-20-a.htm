I. Provided that the relevant statute granting rulemaking authority for an existing rule is valid and in effect and requires the agency to adopt the rule, the agency to which such authority is granted shall act expeditiously to commence rulemaking pursuant to RSA 541-A to prevent expiration of such rules and to allow adequate time for the committee to consider the rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If an agency consistently fails to readopt its rules prior to their expiration as provided in paragraph I, the committee may direct the agency to contact the director to develop a timetable of readoption or readoption with amendments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. An agency shall not be precluded from adopting an interim rule pursuant to RSA 541-A:19, I(d) to keep rules from expiring or RSA 541-A:19, I(e) to put expired rules back into effect.
