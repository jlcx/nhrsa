&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an agency proposes a rule pursuant to RSA 541-A:3 or 541-A:19, the agency shall identify the specific section or sections of state or federal statutes or regulations which the rule is intended to implement in the notice required pursuant to RSA 541-A:6 and 541-A:19, II, and either in the rule, or in a separate cross-reference table pursuant to paragraph II.  The notice shall be in such form as the director of legislative services shall prescribe until otherwise provided by the drafting and procedure manual adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A:8.  The identification in the rule shall be made in the manner specified in the drafting and procedure manual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the specific section or sections of state statute or federal statute or regulation required by paragraph I are not identified in the rule itself, the agency shall file the information in a separate cross-reference table with each filing of the proposed or adopted rule other than an emergency rule.  The agency shall make the table available to the public with a proposed or adopted rule whenever the rule is made available to or requested by the public.  Unless otherwise specified by the drafting and procedure manual, the table shall be filed as an appendix to the rule and, when the rule is published pursuant to RSA 541-A:15, shall be published as an appendix to the rule chapter containing the rule.  The table shall not be required to be filed on a separate page.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. General references to the name or title of a state or federal statute or regulation shall not suffice for the purposes of this section.  To the extent that specific provisions of the proposed rule are designed to implement different sections or provisions of state or federal statutes or regulations, the agency shall reference the state or federal statute or regulation as provided in paragraph I, with the provision of the proposed rule that is intended to implement that statute or regulation.
