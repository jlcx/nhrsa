&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The presiding officer shall grant one or more petitions for intervention if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The petition is submitted in writing to the presiding officer, with copies mailed to all parties named in the presiding officer's notice of the hearing, at least 3 days before the hearing;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The petition states facts demonstrating that the petitioner's rights, duties, privileges, immunities or other substantial interests may be affected by the proceeding or that the petitioner qualifies as an intervenor under any provision of law;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The presiding officer determines that the interests of justice and the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings would not be impaired by allowing the intervention.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The presiding officer may grant one or more petitions for intervention at any time, upon determining that such intervention would be in the interests of justice and would not impair the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a petitioner qualifies for intervention, the presiding officer may impose conditions upon the intervenor's participation in the proceedings, either at the time that intervention is granted or at any subsequent time.  Such conditions may include, but are not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Limitation of the intervenor's participation to designated issues in which the intervenor has a particular interest demonstrated by the petition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Limitation of the intervenor's use of cross-examination and other procedures so as to promote the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Requiring 2 or more intervenors to combine their presentations of evidence and argument, cross-examination, and other participation in the proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Limitations imposed in accordance with paragraph III shall not be so extensive as to prevent the intervenor from protecting the interest which formed the basis of the intervention.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The presiding officer shall render an order granting or denying each petition for intervention, specifying any conditions and briefly stating the reasons for the order.  The presiding officer may modify the order at any time, stating the reasons for the modification.
