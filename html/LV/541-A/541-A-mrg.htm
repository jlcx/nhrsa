<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an agency proposes a rule pursuant to RSA 541-A:3 or 541-A:19, the agency shall identify the specific section or sections of state or federal statutes or regulations which the rule is intended to implement in the notice required pursuant to RSA 541-A:6 and 541-A:19, II, and either in the rule, or in a separate cross-reference table pursuant to paragraph II.  The notice shall be in such form as the director of legislative services shall prescribe until otherwise provided by the drafting and procedure manual adopted pursuant to RSA 541-A:8.  The identification in the rule shall be made in the manner specified in the drafting and procedure manual.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the specific section or sections of state statute or federal statute or regulation required by paragraph I are not identified in the rule itself, the agency shall file the information in a separate cross-reference table with each filing of the proposed or adopted rule other than an emergency rule.  The agency shall make the table available to the public with a proposed or adopted rule whenever the rule is made available to or requested by the public.  Unless otherwise specified by the drafting and procedure manual, the table shall be filed as an appendix to the rule and, when the rule is published pursuant to RSA 541-A:15, shall be published as an appendix to the rule chapter containing the rule.  The table shall not be required to be filed on a separate page.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. General references to the name or title of a state or federal statute or regulation shall not suffice for the purposes of this section.  To the extent that specific provisions of the proposed rule are designed to implement different sections or provisions of state or federal statutes or regulations, the agency shall reference the state or federal statute or regulation as provided in paragraph I, with the provision of the proposed rule that is intended to implement that statute or regulation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 541-A:10 Filing of Proposed Rule Text;  Establishing and Revising Text. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At the same time the notice required by RSA 541-A:6, I is filed, the agency shall file the text of the proposed rule with the director of legislative services.  The first time a rule is proposed under RSA 541-A:3 to implement newly-enacted state authority, the agency shall send an electronic copy of the notice and proposed rule to the chair of each house and senate standing policy committee, as defined in RSA 541-A:1, XVI, for distribution to the members of such standing policy committees.  If the newly-enacted state authority was not referred originally to a standing policy committee, the agency shall send an electronic copy of the notice and proposed rule to the speaker of the house and senate president for appropriate distribution.  If the agency does not have the technology necessary to send an electronic copy, the agency shall send a paper copy.  The members of the standing policy committees receiving proposed rules may review the proposed rules to determine whether the proposed rule is consistent with the intent of the authorizing legislation.  If a standing policy committee concludes that the proposed rule is not consistent with the intent of the authorizing legislation, the standing policy committee shall send written notice to the agency, with a copy to the director of legislative services, identifying the provision or provisions the committee believes to be inconsistent with legislative intent.  Such written notice may be sent to the agency via e-mail and shall be delivered so as to be received by the agency no later than the deadline for public comment specified in the rulemaking notice.  If the agency does not receive notice from any standing policy committee by the end of the public comment period, the agency may proceed on the basis that the rule is consistent with the intent of the authorizing legislation.  The text of the proposed rules as filed by the agency pursuant to RSA 541-A:3, III shall not be changed prior to the hearing held pursuant to RSA 541-A:11, I(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The agency shall not establish the text of the final proposal until after the conclusion of the public comment period established pursuant to RSA 541-A:11, I(b).  If the agency elects to solicit comment pursuant to RSA 541-A:11, I(c), the agency shall prepare a draft final proposal that is annotated to show how the rules as initially proposed are proposed to be changed.  In response to comment received, the agency may revise the draft prior to filing the final proposal in accordance with RSA 541-A:12.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Each agency shall hold at least one public hearing on all proposed rules filed pursuant to RSA 541-A:3 and shall afford all interested persons reasonable opportunity to testify and to submit data, views, or arguments in writing or, if practicable for the agency, in electronic format, in accordance with the terms of the notice filed pursuant to RSA 541-A:3, I and the provisions of this section.  The office of legislative services shall provide oral or written comments on potential bases for committee objection under RSA 541-A:13, IV in a form and manner determined by the director of the office of legislative services.  Each agency shall require all materials submitted in writing to be signed by the person who submits them, and the agency shall transfer to hard copy, if practicable for the agency, all materials submitted as diskette, electronic mail, or other electronic format.  Copies of the proposed rule shall be available to the public under RSA 91-A and at least 5 days prior to the date of the hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For rules proposed by a board or commission, a period of at least 5 business days after the hearing shall be provided for the submission of materials in writing or in electronic format, unless a shorter period is specified in the notice.  If a shorter period is specified in the notice, the deadline for the submission of such materials shall not be earlier than the scheduled conclusion of the public hearing.  For rules proposed by an agency official, a period of at least 5 business days after the hearing shall be provided in all instances.  If a hearing is continued or postponed as provided in paragraph III or IV of this section, the period for the submission of materials in writing or in electronic format shall be extended unless the previously-established deadline meets the applicable requirement specified above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An agency may hold a public hearing or otherwise solicit public comment on a draft final proposed rule prior to filing the final proposed rule pursuant to RSA 541-A:3, V.  Notice of such hearing or comment period shall be provided by such means as are deemed appropriate to reach interested persons, which may include publishing a notice in the rulemaking register.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For rules proposed by a board or commission, each hearing shall be attended by a quorum of its members.  For rules proposed by an agency official, each hearing shall be held by the official having the rulemaking authority, or designee, who shall be knowledgeable in the particular subject area of the proposed rules.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. To provide reasonable opportunity for public comment, the agency may continue a public hearing past the scheduled time or to another date, or may extend the deadline for submission of written comment.  If the agency continues the hearing or extends the deadline, it shall notify the public by any means it deems appropriate, including notice in the rulemaking register whenever practicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A public comment hearing may be postponed in the event of any of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Inclement weather.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Illness or unavoidable absence of the official with rulemaking authority.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Lack of a quorum due to illness or unavoidable absence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Determination by the agency that postponement of the public comment hearing shall facilitate greater participation by the public.  If a public comment hearing is postponed, the agency shall provide notice in the rulemaking register at least 5 days before such postponed public comment hearing, and may also provide notice by any other means it deems appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A public comment hearing may be moved to another location if the agency determines for any reason that the original location is not able to accommodate the public.  If changing the location does not also necessitate a change in the date of the public comment hearing, the agency shall post notice of the new location at the originally scheduled facility.  If changing the location necessitates a change in the date of the public comment hearing, the agency shall provide notice as required by paragraph IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. On request, the agency shall promptly provide a copy of any rule as filed with the director at any stage in the rulemaking process.  If the copy is mailed, it shall be sent not later than the end of the third working day after the request is received.  The agency may, pursuant to RSA 91-A:4, IV, charge the actual cost of providing such copy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. If requested by an interested person at any time before 30 days after final adoption of a rule, the adopting authority shall issue an explanation of the rule.  The explanation shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A concise statement of the principal reasons for and against the adoption of the rule in its final form.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An explanation of why the adopting authority overruled the arguments and considerations against the rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. In addition to seeking information by other methods, an agency, before publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking under RSA 541-A:6, may solicit comments from the public on a subject matter of possible rulemaking under active consideration within the agency by causing notice to be published in the rulemaking register of the subject matter and indicating where, when, and how persons may provide comment on the rules under consideration.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After fully considering public comment and any committee comments or comments by the office of the legislative services received pursuant to RSA 541-A:11, and any other relevant information, a quorum of the members of the agency or the agency official having rulemaking authority shall establish the text of the final proposed rule.  After the text of the final proposed rule has been established, the agency shall file the final proposal no earlier than 21 days and no later than 150 days after the date of publication of the notice in the rulemaking register.  If an agency is required to rewrite a rule in accordance with RSA 541-A:8, the agency shall have up to 180 days after the date of publication of the notice in the rulemaking register to file the final proposal.  The agency shall file the final proposal with the director of legislative services.  Final proposals filed no later than 14 days before a regularly scheduled committee meeting shall be placed on the agenda for that meeting.  Final proposals filed fewer than 14 days before a regularly scheduled committee meeting shall be placed on the agenda of the following regularly scheduled committee meeting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 541-A:13 Review by the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The committee shall either approve the rule or enter a conditional approval or objection under paragraph V within 45 days of the filing of a final proposal under RSA 541-A:12, I, unless the deadline is waived for good cause pursuant to RSA 541-A:40.  The committee shall either approve the rule or enter a conditional approval or objection under paragraph V within 60 days of the filing of a final proposal under RSA 541-A:12, I-a, unless the deadline is waived for good cause pursuant to RSA 541-A:40.  Objections to a rule may be made only once.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) If an agency has filed a final proposal and the committee has granted the agency's request, pursuant to RSA 541-A:12, I-a, the director of legislative services shall notify the agency of any potential bases for committee objection identified by the office of legislative services by forwarding a copy of the final proposal with the counsel's comments noted thereon at least 14 days prior to the committee meeting at which the proposal will be considered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In response to the comments, an agency may then file a proposed amended final proposal with the director for review by the committee and request that the committee approve the rule as amended.  Both the request and the amendment shall be in writing and shall be filed at least 7 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting or special meeting for which the final proposal has been placed on the agenda.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The committee may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Approve the rule as originally filed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Approve the rule with amendment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Act under paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the committee approves the rule as filed pursuant to RSA 541-A:12, or with amendment, it shall notify the agency in writing of its approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Failure to give notice of either approval, conditional approval, or objection at the end of the 45-day or 60-day period under paragraph I shall be deemed approval.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the rule is approved under subparagraph II(c) or (e), the agency may adopt the rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The committee may object to a proposed rule if the rule is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Beyond the authority of the agency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Contrary to the intent of the legislature;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Determined not to be in the public interest;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Deemed by the committee to have a substantial economic impact not recognized in the fiscal impact statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The following procedures shall govern committee objections:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the committee objects to the final proposal as filed or as amended pursuant to paragraph II, it shall so inform the agency.  In lieu of a preliminary objection, the committee may vote to conditionally approve the rule with an amendment, provided that the committee specifies in its conditional approval the language of the amendment to address the basis for a preliminary objection.  The committee shall notify the agency in writing of its conditional approval.  Within 30 days of the meeting, or in the case of a board or commission, 7 days following its next regularly scheduled meeting, the agency shall submit a written explanation to the committee in the form of a letter and an annotated text of the final proposed rule detailing how the rule has been amended in accordance with the conditional approval.  The written explanation shall be signed by the individual holding rulemaking authority, or, if a body of individuals holds rulemaking authority, by a voting member of that body, provided that a quorum of the body has approved.  Failure to submit a written explanation in accordance with the conditional approval and this paragraph shall cause the conditional approval to be deemed a committee vote to make a preliminary objection on the date of the conditional approval.  If the office of legislative services determines that the agency has amended the rule in accordance with the conditional approval and this paragraph, the office of legislative services shall promptly send written confirmation of compliance to the agency.  The agency may then adopt the rule as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the committee objects to the final proposal as filed or as amended pursuant to paragraph II, the committee shall send the agency a preliminary written objection stating the basis for the objection.  A preliminary objection or conditional approval shall require the assent of a majority of the votes cast, a quorum being present.  If a preliminary objection is made, the committee may send a copy of the preliminary objection to the appropriate house and senate standing policy committees and, if so, shall give notice to the agency.  Within 30 days of the date the preliminary objection was entered, the standing policy committees at properly convened executive sessions shall review the proposed rules and the preliminary objection and shall adopt recommendations or comments relative to the basis for the preliminary objection and shall communicate the same to the committee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The agency shall respond to the preliminary objection by withdrawing the rule, by amending the rule to remove the basis for objection, or by making no change.  The agency shall respond to a committee objection only once, and shall report its response in writing to the committee within 45 days of the committee's vote to make a preliminary objection.  Failure to respond to the committee in accordance with this subparagraph shall mean the rulemaking procedure for that proposed rule is invalid;  however, the agency is not precluded from initiating the process over again for a similar rule.  After receipt of the agency response, the committee may modify its objections made under paragraph IV or approve the rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) After submitting its preliminary objection response and prior to the final committee vote on the final proposal, and in all cases, prior to the adoption of the rule by the agency, the agency may request that the committee approve the rule with further amendment or issue a revised objection.  The committee may approve the rule with further amendment only if the agency submits the request and proposed amendment, in writing to the committee at least 7 days prior to the committee meeting at which the agency presents the rule.  Submission of such a request shall not preclude the agency from requesting a revised objection if the committee does not approve the rule as requested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A revised objection may be made only once by the committee and may be made only at the request of the agency.  The agency shall respond and the committee may review the response in the same manner as a preliminary objection.  No further amendment may be made by the agency after it responds to the committee except as provided in RSA 541-A:14, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) If the agency responds but the basis for the committee's preliminary or revised objection has not been removed or the response creates a new basis for objection, the committee may, by majority vote of the entire committee, file a final objection.  The final objection shall be filed in certified form with the director of legislative services for publication in the next issue of the rulemaking register.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. After a final objection by the committee to a provision in the rule is filed with the director under subparagraph V(f), the burden of proof shall be on the agency in any action for judicial review or for enforcement of the provision to establish that the part objected to is within the authority delegated to the agency, is consistent with the intent of the legislature, is in the public interest, or does not have a substantial economic impact not recognized in the fiscal impact statement.  If the agency fails to meet its burden of proof, the court shall declare the whole or a portion of the rule objected to invalid.  The failure of the committee to object to a rule shall not be an implied legislative authorization of its substantive or procedural lawfulness.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) The provisions of this paragraph may be used by the committee as an alternative to or in addition to the final objection procedure employed by the committee in paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If an agency responds to a preliminary or revised objection but the basis for objection has not been removed or the response creates a new basis for objection, the committee may, within 50 days from the date on which the objection response was due and by majority vote of the entire committee, recommend legislative action through sponsorship of a joint resolution to implement its recommendation.  Such vote shall prevent the rule from being adopted and filed by the agency for the period of time specified in subparagraph VII(c).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the committee votes to sponsor a joint resolution pursuant to subparagraph VII(b), the joint resolution shall be introduced in the house of representatives or senate within 20 business days of such vote when the general court is in session and 20 business days of the start of the following legislative session if such vote occurs when the general court is not in session.  If a joint resolution is not introduced within this time frame, the agency may adopt the rule.  If a joint resolution is introduced within this time frame, the agency shall be prevented from adopting and filing such rule until final legislative action is taken on the resolution or the passage of 90 consecutive calendar days during which the general court shall have been in session, whichever occurs first.  The 90 calendar day period shall commence on the date such joint resolution has been introduced.  If the session of the general court adjourns prior to the sixtieth calendar day after such joint resolution has been introduced, then the agency shall be prevented from adopting and filing such rule until 90 calendar days, beginning with the next session of the general court, have passed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to only the specific portion of the agency's rule identified in the joint resolution.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent an agency from adopting and filing the remainder of the rules in the final proposal under RSA 541-A while the committee pursues legislative action under this paragraph, nor shall it prevent the committee from also voting to enter a final objection pursuant to paragraph V.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nothing in this section shall prevent the general court from introducing legislation which addresses any matter included in a joint resolution introduced under the provisions of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Notwithstanding any house or senate rules to the contrary, a joint resolution which the committee votes to sponsor under subparagraph VII(b) may be introduced at any time during the legislative session.  It shall be subject to the same rules as any other bill introduced at the beginning of the legislative session.

(e) Final legislative action, as defined in RSA 541-A:1, VI-a, is taken on the joint resolution sponsored pursuant to RSA 541-A:13, VII(b) or the passage of the 90 consecutive calendar days specified by RSA 541-A:13, VII(c), whichever occurs first.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The text of the adopted rule shall be the same as the text of the final proposed rule submitted under RSA 541-A:12, unless revised by the agency in direct response to the committee's written objection or as otherwise provided in RSA 541-A:13.  The director of legislative services may refuse to accept for filing any final rule which contains changes, other than minor editorial changes, that are not specifically made in accordance with the procedures provided in RSA 541-A:13, II(b) or RSA 541-A:13, V.  The agency shall identify each minor editorial change in writing to the director of legislative services.

If the agency has specified a later effective date, the agency may modify the date by providing a statement to the director of legislative services which shall indicate the new effective date and all reasons for modifying the date.  The statement shall be published by the director of legislative services in the rulemaking register.  No modified effective date shall occur earlier than the date of publication in the rulemaking register.  The director shall maintain a file of all currently effective rules, and each agency shall maintain a file of its own currently effective rules, both of which shall be open to the public.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If an agency files a notice pursuant to RSA 541-A:6 to readopt existing rules, with or without amendments, the currently effective rules in the filing which would otherwise expire prior to the completion of the readoption of the rules by the agency shall continue in effect until the proposed rules are adopted and effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If, after filing a notice pursuant to paragraph I, an agency fails to file a final proposal by the deadline specified in RSA 541-A:12, fails to file a response to objection as specified in RSA 541-A:13, or fails to adopt and file the proposed rule as specified in paragraph III, the existing rules which would otherwise expire prior to the completion of the readoption of the rules by the agency shall expire 30 days after such deadline unless the agency has obtained a waiver of the deadline pursuant to RSA 541-A:40, IV(a).  If the agency has obtained a waiver to a deadline, such existing rules shall expire 30 days after the deadline established pursuant to RSA 541-A:40, IV(b) if the required action is not taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If rules are extended pursuant to this section, the agency shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Adopt the proposed rules no later than 30 days after the date on which the agency is allowed to adopt the rules under RSA 541-A:14, I;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The director of legislative services shall compile, index, and publish, or require agencies to publish, all effective rules adopted by each agency.  The text of an adopted rule as filed with the director and which is effective shall be the official version of the rule, unless or until a version prepared for publication, which may have editorial changes not affecting the substance of the rule, is certified by the agency as the same in substance as originally filed.  The certified version shall be the official version.  The official version of the rule shall be available to the public by the agency and the director pursuant to RSA 541-A:14, IV.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The director shall send the text of a rule to be certified to the agency adopting the rule.  The agency shall certify the rule under paragraph I within 120 days of receiving the first edited text.  The 120-day deadline shall not apply to interim rules or emergency rules.  A copy of each rule as filed and each as certified shall be sent by the director to the state library and the New Hampshire law library at the supreme court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-b. Compilations shall be supplemented, revised, or published as often as necessary.  The compilation, indexing, or publishing of fiscal impact statements shall not be required.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No rule shall be effective for a period of longer than 10 years except as extended pursuant to RSA 541-A:14-a, but the agency may adopt an identical rule under RSA 541-A:5 through RSA 541-A:14-a, in conformance with the drafting and procedure manual adopted under RSA 541-A:8.

No changes to such organizational and procedural rules may be made by the agency, other than editorial changes not affecting the substance of the procedural rules, without following the rulemaking procedures in this chapter.  However, if the adoption or amendment of a statute governing the agency renders the agency's organizational and procedural rules no longer accurate, such rules shall expire one year after the effective date of the statute that makes such change, unless such organizational and procedural rules are amended, superseded, or repealed before such expiration.  The agency shall commence rulemaking to amend its rules no later than 90 days after the effective date of such statute.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 541-A:18 Emergency Rules. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An agency may proceed to adopt an emergency rule if it finds either that an imminent peril to the public health or safety requires adoption of a rule with less notice than is required under RSA 541-A:6 or that substantial fiscal harm to the state or its citizens could occur if rules are not adopted with less notice than is required under RSA 541-A:6.  The rule may be adopted without having been filed in proposed or final proposed form and may be adopted after whatever notice and hearing the agency finds to be practicable under the circumstances.  The agency shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that emergency rules are made known to persons who may be affected by them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding RSA 541-A:16, III, emergency rules adopted under this section shall not remain in effect for more than 180 days from the date and time of filing with the director of legislative services.  An agency may propose a permanent rule on the same subject at the same time that it adopts an emergency rule, but it shall not adopt the same emergency rule when the emergency rule expires.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Emergency rules adopted under this section shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The name and address of the agency.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The statutory authority for the rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Whether the intended action is an adoption, amendment, or repeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The rule number and title.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A signed and dated statement by the adopting authority explaining the nature of the basis for the emergency rule, including an explanation of the effect upon the state if the emergency rule were not adopted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) A listing of people, enterprises, and government agencies affected by the rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The name, address, and telephone number of an individual in the agency able to answer questions on the emergency rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Emergency rules adopted under this section shall not be adopted solely to avoid the time requirements of this chapter.  The committee may petition the adopting agency to repeal the rule if it determines that the statement of emergency required by RSA 541-A:18, III(e) is inadequate and does not demonstrate that the rule is necessary to prevent an imminent peril to the public health or safety.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Effective rules which are amended or repealed by adoption of an emergency rule shall again be effective in their original form upon expiration of the emergency rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. An agency may repeal an emergency rule by filing a statement with the director of legislative services which includes:
<br>

Publication of notice shall occur no less than 7 days before a regularly scheduled meeting.  If the agency has published notice in a newspaper, pursuant to subparagraph II(a), the agency shall file a copy of the notice as it was published no later than 3 days after the date of publication.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The committee shall vote to approve the rule or object under paragraph VII.  Objections to a proposed interim rule may be made only once.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The committee may object to a proposed interim rule if the rule is:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Beyond the authority of the agency;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Contrary to the intent of the legislature;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Determined not to be in the public interest;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Deemed by the committee not to meet the requirements of paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The following procedures shall govern committee review of interim rules:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The director of legislative services shall notify the agency of any potential bases for committee objection by forwarding a copy of the proposed interim rule with comments noted thereon to the agency at least 7 days prior to the committee meeting at which the rule will be considered.  Following receipt of the comments an agency may amend its interim rule to address the noted potential bases for objection.  The agency may present the amended proposal to the committee for approval at the committee meeting.  The committee may approve the rule as originally proposed or as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the committee objects to the proposed interim rule as filed or as amended, it shall so inform the agency.  In lieu of an objection, the committee may vote to conditionally approve the rule with an amendment, provided that the committee specified in its conditional approval the language of the amendment to address the basis for a preliminary objection.  The committee shall notify the agency in writing of its conditional approval.  Within 14 days of the meeting, the agency shall submit a written explanation to the committee in the form of a letter and an annotated text of the final proposed rule detailing how the rule has been amended in accordance with the conditional approval.  The written explanation shall be signed by the individual holding rulemaking authority, or, if a body of individuals holds rulemaking authority, by a voting member of that body, provided that a quorum of the body has approved.  Failure to submit a written explanation in accordance with the conditional approval and this paragraph shall cause the conditional approval to be deemed a committee vote to make a preliminary objection on the date of the conditional approval.  If the committee legal counsel determines that the agency has amended the rule in accordance with the conditional approval and this paragraph, the committee legal counsel shall promptly send written confirmation of compliance to the agency.  The agency may then adopt the rule as amended.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the committee objects to the proposed interim rule as filed or as amended pursuant to subparagraph VIII(a), the committee shall send the agency a written objection stating the basis for the objection.  An objection or a conditional approval shall require the assent of a majority of the votes cast, a quorum being present.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the committee makes an objection to the proposed interim rule pursuant to subparagraph VIII(c), the agency may cure the defect or withdraw the interim rule.  The agency shall respond to a committee objection only once, and shall report its response in writing to the committee prior to its next regularly scheduled meeting.  Failure to respond to the committee in accordance with this subparagraph shall mean the rulemaking procedure for that proposed interim rule is invalid;  however, the agency is not precluded from initiating the process over again for a similar rule, provided the conditions in paragraph I are met.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The committee shall review the response and vote to approve the response or continue the objection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The committee's objection shall not preclude the agency from adopting the substance of an interim rule by meeting the requirements of RSA 541-A:3.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. No proposed interim rule shall be adopted unless within 90 days of publication of the notice the committee votes to approve or conditionally approve the proposed interim rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. No proposed interim rule shall be adopted unless the committee has voted to approve the proposed interim rule or conditionally approve the proposed interim rule, provided that the committee legal counsel has sent written confirmation to the agency pursuant to RSA 541-A:19, VIII(b). An adopted interim rule shall be filed with the director of legislative services no later than 30 days following committee approval or conditional approval.  An interim rule shall be effective under RSA 541-A:16, III on the day after filing with the director of legislative services, or at a later date, provided the agency so specifies in a letter to the director of legislative services and the effective date is within 30 days following committee approval or conditional approval.  Interim rules shall be effective for a period not to exceed 180 days.  During the time an interim rule shall be in effect, the agency may propose a permanent rule to replace the interim rule once it expires, but it shall not adopt another interim rule to replace the expiring interim rule.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 541-A:30 Agency Action Against Licensees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a timely and sufficient application has been made in accordance with agency rules for renewal of a license for any activity of a continuing nature that does not automatically expire by law, the existing license shall not expire until the agency has taken final action upon the application for renewal.  If the agency's final action is unfavorable, the license shall not expire until the last day for seeking judicial review of the agency's action, or a later date fixed by the reviewing court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An agency shall not revoke, suspend, modify, annul, withdraw, or amend a license unless the agency first gives notice to the licensee of the facts or conduct upon which the agency intends to base its action, and gives the licensee an opportunity, through an adjudicative proceeding, to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the agency finds that public health, safety or welfare requires emergency action and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, immediate suspension of a license may be ordered pending an adjudicative proceeding.  The agency shall commence this adjudicative proceeding not later than 10 working days after the date of the agency order suspending the license.  A record of the proceeding shall be made by a certified shorthand court reporter provided by the agency.  Unless expressly waived by the licensee, agency failure to commence an adjudicative proceeding within 10 working days shall mean that the suspension order is automatically vacated.  The agency shall not again suspend the license for the same conduct which formed the basis of the vacated suspension without granting the licensee prior notice and an opportunity for an adjudicative proceeding.
