<codesect>
If a majority of the officials of the agency who are to render the final decision in a contested case have not heard the case or read the record, the decision, if adverse to a party to the proceeding other than the agency itself, shall not be made until a proposal for decision is served upon the parties and an opportunity is afforded to each party adversely affected to file exceptions and present briefs and oral argument to the officials who are to render the final decision.  The proposal for decision shall contain a statement of the reasons for the decision and shall set forth each issue of fact or law necessary to the proposed decision, prepared by the person who conducted the hearing or one who has read the record.  The parties by written stipulation may waive compliance with this section.
