&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 540:2 Termination of Tenancy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The lessor or owner of nonrestricted property may terminate any tenancy by giving to the tenant or occupant a notice in writing to quit the premises in accordance with RSA 540:3 and 5.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The lessor or owner of restricted property may terminate any tenancy by giving to the tenant or occupant a notice in writing to quit the premises in accordance with RSA 540:3 and 5, but only for one of the following reasons:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Neglect or refusal to pay rent due and in arrears, upon demand.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Substantial damage to the premises by the tenant, members of his household, or guests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Failure of the tenant to comply with a material term of the lease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Behavior of the tenant or members of his family which adversely affects the health or safety of the other tenants or the landlord or his representatives, or failure of the tenant to accept suitable temporary relocation due to lead-based paint hazard abatement, as set forth in RSA 130-A:8-a, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Other good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The dwelling unit contains a lead exposure-hazard which the owner will abate by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Methods other than interim controls or encapsulation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Any other method which can reasonably be expected to take more than 30 days to perform;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Removing the dwelling unit from the residential rental market.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Willful failure by the tenant to prepare the unit for remediation of an infestation of insects or rodents, including bed bugs, after receipt of reasonable written notice of the required preparations and reasonable time to complete them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the grounds for eviction is other good cause as set forth in paragraph II(e) of this section, and such cause is based on the actions or inactions of the tenant, members of his family, or guests, the landlord shall, prior to the issuance of the eviction notice, provide the tenant with written notice stating that in the future such actions or inactions would constitute grounds for eviction.  Such notice shall be served in accordance with RSA 540:5 or by certified mail.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A tenant's refusal to agree to a change in the existing rental agreement calling for an increase in the amount of rent shall constitute good cause for eviction under paragraph II(e) of this section, provided that the landlord provided the tenant with written notice of the amount and effective date of the rent increase at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the increase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. "Other good cause'' as set forth in paragraph II(e) of this section includes, but is not limited to, any legitimate business or economic reason and need not be based on the action or inaction of the tenant, members of his family, or guests.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No tenancy shall be terminated for nonpayment of rent if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The tenant was forced to take over the landlord's utility payments in order to prevent utility services, which the landlord agreed to provide, from being terminated;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The amount of rent which the tenant is in arrears does not exceed the amount paid by the tenant to maintain utility service to the tenant's premises;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The tenant has receipts from the utility company or other proof of payment of the amount paid to maintain utility service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) No lessor or owner of restricted property shall terminate a tenancy solely based on a tenant or a household member of a tenant having been a victim of domestic violence as defined in RSA 173-B, sexual assault as defined in RSA 632-A, or stalking as defined in RSA 633:3-a, provided that the tenant or household member of a tenant who is the victim provides the lessor or owner with written verification that the tenant or household member of a tenant who is the victim has obtained a valid protective order against the perpetrator of the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A tenant who has obtained a protective order from a court of competent jurisdiction granting him or her possession of a dwelling to the exclusion of one or more other tenants or household members may request that a lock be replaced or configured for a new key at the tenant's expense.  The lessor or owner shall, if provided a copy of the protective order, comply with the request and shall not give copies of the new keys to the tenant or household member restrained or excluded by the protective order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A lessor or owner who replaces a lock or configures a lock for a new key in accordance with subparagraph (b) shall not be liable for any damages that result directly from the lock replacement or reconfiguration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If, after a hearing in the possessory action, the court finds that there are grounds under this section to evict the tenant or household member accused of the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, it may issue a judgment in favor of the lessor or owner of the property against the person accused, and allow the tenancy of the remainder of the residents to continue undisturbed.  The lessor or owner of the rental unit at issue in the possessory action shall have the right to bar the person accused of the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking from the unit and from the lessor's or owner's property once judgment in the possessory action becomes final against such person.  Thereafter, and notwithstanding RSA 635:2, the person's entry upon the lessor's or owner's property after being notified in writing that he or she has been barred from the property shall constitute a trespass.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Nothing in this section shall preclude eviction for nonpayment of rent.  A landlord may evict on any grounds set forth in RSA 540:2, II which are unrelated to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The defense set forth in subparagraph VII(a) shall be an affirmative defense to possessory actions brought pursuant to subparagraph II(b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section.

(1) File a notice of intent to appeal with the district court within 7 days of the notice of the district's decision;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) File a notice of appeal in the supreme court within 30 days of the notice of the district court's decision;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Pay all rent, as it comes due, between the date of the notice of intent to appeal the district court's decision and the final disposition of the appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The writ of summons and the notice provided in paragraph II shall be returnable 7 days from the date of service of the writ by the sheriff.  The writ of summons shall provide an opportunity for the landlord, at the landlord's option, to make a claim for an award of unpaid rent.  If the landlord elects to make a claim for unpaid rent, the court shall consider any defense, claim, or counterclaim by the tenant which offsets or reduces the amount owed to the plaintiff.  If the court finds that the landlord is entitled to possession on the ground of nonpayment of rent, it shall also award the landlord a money judgment.  If the court determines that the amount owed by the landlord to the tenant, as a result of set-off or counterclaim exceeds or equals the amount of rent and other lawful charges owed by the tenant to the landlord, judgment in the possessory action shall be granted in favor of the tenant.  If the court finds that the tenant's counterclaim exceeds the amount of the nonpayment, a money judgment shall issue in favor of the tenant.  Any decision rendered by the court related to a money judgment, shall be limited to a maximum of $1,500 and shall not preclude either party from making a subsequent claim in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover any additional amounts not covered by the $1,500 judgment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Both parties shall have a right to engage in discovery prior to the hearing on the merits within such time frame as may be established for eviction actions by the Rules of the District Court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If the tenant files an appearance, a hearing shall be scheduled to occur within 10 days after such filing, with allowance for additional time pursuant to paragraph IV, with notice of the hearing mailed to the parties no fewer than 6 days prior to the hearing.  If the tenant fails to file an appearance or fails to appear at the hearing on the merits, the court shall mail a notice of default to the address set forth on the summons at least 3 days prior to the issuance of the writ of possession.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In deciding any contested hearing, the court shall issue a written decision setting forth the basis for its decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In the case of nonpayment of rent, while the possessory action is pending, the landlord may accept payment of the rental arrearage without creating a new tenancy, provided that the landlord informs the tenant in writing of the landlord's intention to proceed with the eviction in spite of the landlord's acceptance of the payment.  The landlord may choose not to accept payment and to proceed with the eviction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 540:13-c Discretionary Stay Dependent on Payment of Rent. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the defendant defaults, or confesses judgment, or if on trial the court rules that the landlord has sustained his complaint, judgment shall be rendered that the landlord recover possession of the premises and costs.  A writ of possession shall be issued, provided that, the court may order the tenant shall not be dispossessed until a date not later than 3 months from such default, confession of judgment, or ruling of the court, provided the court decides that under all the circumstances justice requires such stay, based on the reasonableness and good faith of the parties in their respective reports, complaints, demands, and evidence.  In the event of any such stay of dispossession, the tenant shall pay the landlord weekly in advance the weekly former rent, or the proportional weekly part of the former rent if rent was payable less often than weekly, and on default of any such advance weekly payment a writ of possession shall be issued and the sheriff shall evict the tenant as soon as possible.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the parties in a case of nonpayment of rent from agreeing that, in spite of judgment for the plaintiff, a writ of possession shall not be issued, if the defendant makes payments in accordance with a schedule designated in the agreement.  The agreement may incorporate the arrearage, future rent due, court costs, and service fees.  The agreement shall be filed with the court and shall state the date when final payment of the arrearage, court costs, and service fees are due.  Entering into such an agreement shall waive the defendant's right to appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Every such agreement shall conspicuously state in a separate paragraph at the end of the agreement the following language:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I, TENANT/DEFENDANT IN THIS ACTION, UNDERSTAND THAT IF I FAIL TO MAKE ANY OF THE PAYMENTS CALLED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT ON TIME, THE COURT MAY ORDER THE SHERIFF TO EVICT ME WITHOUT A HEARING.  I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT I AM GIVING UP MY RIGHT TO FILE ANY APPEAL IN THIS CASE.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the plaintiff has not filed an affidavit of non-compliance within 14 days of the date that the final payment under the agreement established under this paragraph is due, the court shall dismiss the action.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The acceptance of any payment pursuant to such an agreement shall not establish a new tenancy.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If payments are not made when due, as evidenced by an affidavit of non-compliance filed with the court by the plaintiff and served in hand or at the abode of the defendant before the affidavit is filed with the court, the court shall issue a writ of possession, within 5 business days of the filing of the affidavit with the court, and without further hearing or judicial review.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (d), the court may hold a hearing to determine whether or not a writ of possession shall issue if the defendant files an objection or other pleading in court within 4 business days of the filing of the affidavit of non-compliance and certificate of service with the court, which alleges that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The defendant made a timely tender of the required payment;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The defendant had a specific compelling cause for not tendering the required payment or payments on time, and that the defendant is able to tender the past-due payment or payments at the time the defendant files his or her objection or other pleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the court finds that the defendant's motion or other pleading do not meet the requirements of subparagraph (1)(A) or (1)(B), it shall issue a writ of possession.  If the court determines that the defendant's allegations meet the requirements, a hearing shall be scheduled to occur within 4 business days of the filing of the defendant's objection or other pleading.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f)(1) At any hearing under subparagraph (e)(2), the defendant shall have the burden to prove that:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The defendant has made timely payments, and therefore the writ of possession shall not issue;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The defendant has brought to court cash or a certified check sufficient to tender all past-due payments, and the defendant had a specific compelling cause for his or her failure to tender any past-due payments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the defendant fails to meet his or her burden of proof under subparagraph (1)(A) or (1)(B), the court shall issue the writ of possession.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) If the defendant meets his or her burden of proof under subparagraph (1)(B), the court shall order the defendant to tender, by cash or certified check, all past-due payments to the plaintiff immediately.  If all past due-payments are tendered immediately by cash or certified check, a writ of possession shall not issue, otherwise a writ of possession shall issue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 540:13-d Defenses to Violations of Fitness. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No action for possession based on nonpayment of rent shall be maintained in regard to any premises leased or rented for residential purposes, other than for vacation or recreation, if such premises are in substantial violation of the standards of fitness for health and safety set forth in RSA 48-A or in local codes, ordinances or bylaws established pursuant thereto, and such violation materially affects the habitability of said premises, provided that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The tenant proves by clear and convincing evidence that, while not in arrears in rent, he provided notice of the violation to the person to whom he customarily pays rent;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The landlord failed to correct the violations within 14 days of the receipt of such written notice or, in an emergency, as promptly as conditions require;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The violations were not caused by the tenant, a member of the tenant's family or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Necessary repairs have not been prevented due to extreme weather conditions or due to the failure of the tenant to allow the landlord reasonable access to the premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a defendant raises a defense provided in paragraph I of this section, the court may order the action continued for a reasonable time not to exceed one month to enable the plaintiff to remedy the violation.  At the time such continuance is ordered, the court shall require the person claiming a defense under this section to pay into court any rent withheld or becoming due thereafter as it becomes due.  Upon a finding by the court that the violation has been remedied within the continuance period, the court shall dismiss the possessory action and either award the withheld rent money to the plaintiff or apportion the rent paid into court by paying to the plaintiff the fair rental value of the premises while in the substantially defective condition and by awarding the remainder of said funds to the defendant as damages for plaintiff's breach of his warranty of habitability.  If the violation has not been remedied within such period, the court shall enter judgment for the defendant and refund to the defendant all money deposited.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 540:13-e Infestation of Bed Bugs:  Liability for Costs of Remediation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Infestation of bed'' means the presence of bed bugs in real property rented for residential purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Remediation'' means action taken by the landlord that substantially reduces the presence of bed bugs in a dwelling unit for at least 60 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The landlord shall bear the reasonable costs of remediation of an infestation of bed bugs, but may recover those costs if the tenant is responsible for the infestation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a landlord alleges that a tenant is responsible for an infestation of bed bugs, the landlord may bill the tenant, in writing, for the reasonable costs of remediation of the infestation of bed bugs in the tenant's own unit.  If within 30 days of the completion of remediation the tenant has not paid the landlord for the reasonable costs of remediation, or entered into a repayment agreement with the landlord, such failure shall be considered grounds for eviction for nonpayment of rent pursuant to RSA 540:2, II(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In an eviction action for nonpayment of rent based on failure to pay the reasonable costs of remediation, or in an action for damages for the reasonable costs of remediation of an infestation of bed bugs, the landlord shall bear the burden of proving both that the tenant was responsible for the infestation and that the landlord offered the tenant the opportunity to enter into a reasonable repayment agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In an eviction action for nonpayment of rent based on failure to pay the reasonable costs of remediation of an infestation of bed bugs, or in an action for damages for the reasonable costs of remediation of an infestation of bed bugs:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Notwithstanding paragraph IV, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the tenant is responsible for the infestation if during the 6 months prior to the inception of the defendant's tenancy, and throughout the defendant's tenancy, there were no reports, to the landlord or a municipal health or housing authority, of the presence of bed bugs in the defendant's unit or the dwelling units of a multiple-unit building that are adjacent to or directly above or below the defendant's unit, or by previous tenants in a single-family home.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, the defendant's own report to the landlord or a municipal health or housing authority shall not be considered a report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In evaluating which party is responsible for the infestation, the court shall consider the totality of the evidence, including but not limited to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The existence and extent of bed bugs in other units or common areas anywhere in the building prior to and during the tenant's tenancy;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In which unit bed bugs were first discovered;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Whether and to what extent, prior to the infestation that is the subject of the litigation, the landlord undertook remediation efforts in the tenant's unit and the units adjacent to and directly above and below the tenant's unit;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Whether the tenant had bed bugs in the dwelling unit in which he or she resided immediately prior to moving to the unit that is the subject of the litigation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 540:14 Judgment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the defendant makes default, or if on trial it is considered by the court that the plaintiff has sustained its complaint, judgment shall be rendered that the plaintiff recover possession of the demanded premises and costs, and a writ of possession shall issue.  In cases based on nonpayment of rent, the court shall state the actual amount of the tenant's current weekly rent or, if rent is not paid on a weekly basis, the equivalent weekly rent amount, which must be paid into the court if an appeal is taken pursuant to RSA 540:20 and 540:25.  The judgment may be enforced, at the sole discretion of the plaintiff, either by directing the sheriff to serve the writ of possession or by seeking judicial relief against the defendant for civil contempt.  A writ of possession shall authorize the sheriff to remove the defendant from the premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Whenever the tenant successfully raises the defense of retaliation pursuant to RSA 540:13-a, damages of not more than 3 months' rent may be awarded to the tenant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the plaintiff makes a successful claim for unpaid rent as well as possession, or the defendant makes a successful counterclaim, the court shall issue a money judgment at the same time that it makes its ruling regarding possession of the premises.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the court renders judgment against any one tenant or member of a multiperson household pursuant to RSA 540:2, VII(d), the court shall specify in its order that the writ of possession shall only be used to remove the tenant or household member against whom the judgment issued, and that the other tenants or household members may remain in residence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 540:25 Recognizance, by Defendant. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the possessory action was instituted on the basis of nonpayment of rent, and the defendant files a notice of intent to appeal, the defendant shall pay into court the current rent in an amount determined by the judgment of the court pursuant to RSA 540:14, I, weekly and in advance.  Payment of rent for one week must be made at the time the defendant files notice of intent to appeal in the district court.  Rent which had been payable on other than a weekly basis shall be paid to the court each week based on the equivalent weekly rent determined by the judgment issued by the court, pursuant to RSA 540:14, I. During the pendency of the appeal, rent is payable on a weekly basis and is due on the same day of the week on which the notice of intent to appeal was filed.  If rent is not paid by the due date, the court shall immediately mail a notice of default to the tenant and issue a writ of possession to the landlord.  If, however, the tenant pays the clerk the entire amount of rent due since the filing of the notice of intent to appeal prior to the service of the writ by the sheriff, the writ of possession shall be recalled and the appeal shall be reinstated.  Unless the appeal is reinstated, the district court shall vacate the appeal and award the plaintiff the rent money that has been paid into court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. At any time during the pendency of the appeal, the landlord may file a motion to the district court for recovery of the rent money that has been paid into court pursuant to paragraph I. The court may grant such motion unless the tenant objects and the court rules that the landlord is not lawfully entitled to the full amount of rent.  If the court rules that the landlord is not entitled to the full amount of the rent, it shall release such portion of the rent to which the court deems the landlord is lawfully entitled, if any, and make specific findings in support of its decision to deny or partially deny the landlord's motion.  The rent money retained by the court shall be apportioned between the landlord and the tenant upon final disposition of the appeal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the possessory action was instituted for a reason other than nonpayment of rent, the defendant shall pay into court or to the plaintiff, as the court directs, all rents becoming due from the date the notice of intent to appeal is filed with the district court.  In any case in which the duty to pay rent or a portion thereof is in dispute, the defendant shall be required to pay such portion of the rents becoming due after the notice of intent is filed into court, as the court may direct, which amounts shall be held by the court in escrow until a final decision is rendered.  After such decision has been rendered, the escrowed rent money and any accrued interest thereon shall be apportioned between plaintiff and defendant on the basis of a finding of rent actually due.  For the purpose of this section, "rent'' shall mean the amount of money called for by the lease or rental agreement at the time the action for possession was instituted.
