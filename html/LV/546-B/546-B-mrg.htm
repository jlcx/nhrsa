&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:7 Continuing, Exclusive Jurisdiction. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As long as this state remains the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee, or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Until each individual party has filed written consent with the tribunal of this state for a tribunal of another state to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A tribunal of this state issuing a child support order consistent with the law of this state may not exercise its continuing jurisdiction to modify the order if the order has been modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a child support order of this state is modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to a law substantially similar to this chapter, a tribunal of this state loses its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction with regard to prospective enforcement of the order issued in this state, and may only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Enforce the order that was modified as to amounts accruing before the modification;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enforce nonmodifiable aspects of that order;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide other appropriate relief for violations of that order which occurred before the effective date of the modification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A tribunal of this state shall recognize the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal of another state which has issued a child support order pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A temporary support order issued ex parte or pending resolution of a jurisdictional conflict does not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the issuing tribunal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal support order throughout the existence of the support obligation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:9 Recognition of Controlling Child Support Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and 2 or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of this state or another state with regard to the same obligor and child, a tribunal of this state shall apply the following rules in determining which order to recognize for purposes of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls and must be so recognized, but if an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls and must be so recognized;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the tribunal of this state having jurisdiction over the parties shall issue a child support order, which controls and must be so recognized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If 2 or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and child and if the obligor or the individual obligee resides in this state, a party may request a tribunal of this state to determine which order controls and must be so recognized under paragraph II.  The request must be accompanied by a certified copy of every support order in effect.  The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The tribunal that issued the controlling order recognized under paragraph I, II, or III is the tribunal that has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under RSA 546-B:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A tribunal of this state which determines by order the identity of the controlling order under subparagraph II(a) or (b), or which issue a new controlling order under subparagraph II(c) shall include in that order the basis upon which the tribunal made its determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Within 30 days after issuance of the order determining the identity of the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it with each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support.  A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.

II. If an obligee prevails, a responding tribunal may assess against an obligor filing fees, reasonable attorney's fees, other costs, and necessary travel and other reasonable expenses incurred by the obligee and the obligee's witnesses.  The tribunal may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against the obligee or the support enforcement agency of either the initiating or the responding state, except as provided by other law.  Attorney's fees may be taxed as costs, and may be ordered paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in the attorney's own name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:43 Notice of Registration of Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a support order or income-withholding order issued in another state is registered, the registering tribunal shall notify the nonregistering party.  The notice must be accompanied by a copy of the registered order and the documents and relevant information accompanying the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The notice must inform the nonregistering party:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That a registered order is enforceable as of the date of registration in the same manner as an order issued by a tribunal of this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order must be requested within 20 days after the date of mailing or personal service of the notice;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That failure to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order in a timely manner will result in confirmation of the order and enforcement of the order and the alleged arrearages, and precludes further contest of that order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Of the amount of any alleged arrearages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon registration of an income-withholding order for enforcement, the registering tribunal or, if applicable, the support enforcement agency, shall notify the obligor's employer pursuant to RSA 458-B.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:44 Procedure to Contest Validity or Enforcement of Registered Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A nonregistering party seeking to contest the validity or enforcement of a registered order in this state shall request a hearing within 20 days after the date of mailing or personal service of notice of the registration.  The nonregistering party may seek to vacate the registration, to assert any defense to an allegation of noncompliance with the registered order, or to contest the remedies being sought or the amount of any alleged arrearages pursuant to RSA 546-B:45, relative to contest of registration or enforcement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the nonregistering party fails to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order in a timely manner, the order is confirmed by operation of law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a nonregistering party requests a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order, the registering tribunal shall schedule the matter for hearing and give notice to the parties of the date, time, and place of the hearing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:45 Contest of Registration or Enforcement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A party contesting the validity or enforcement of a registered order or seeking to vacate the registration has the burden of proving one or more of the following defenses:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The order was obtained by fraud;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The order has been vacated, suspended, or modified by a later order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The issuing tribunal has stayed the order pending appeal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) There is a defense under the law of this state to the remedy sought;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Full or partial payment has been made;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The statute of limitation under RSA 546-B:42, relative to choice of law, precludes enforcement of some or all of the arrearages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a party presents evidence establishing a full or partial defense under paragraph I, a tribunal may stay enforcement of the registered order, continue the proceeding to permit production of additional relevant evidence, and issue other appropriate orders.  An uncontested portion of the registered order may be enforced by all remedies available under the law of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the contesting party does not establish a defense under paragraph I to the validity or enforcement of the order, the registering tribunal shall issue an order confirming the order.

A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a child support order issued in another state shall register that order in this state in the same manner provided in Part A of this article, RSA 546-B:39-42, if the order has not been registered.  A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a request for registration, or later.  The pleading must specify the grounds for modification.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:48 Effect of Registration for Modification. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
A tribunal of this state may enforce a child support order of another state registered for purposes of modification, in the same manner as if the order had been issued by a tribunal of this state, but the registered order may be modified only if the requirements of RSA 546-B:49, relative to modification of child support order of another state, have been met.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:49 Modification of Child Support Order of Another State. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this state, the responding tribunal of this state may modify that order only if, after notice and hearing, it finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The following requirements are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The child, the individual obligee, and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The child, or a party who is an individual, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal, and all of the individual parties have filed a written consent in the issuing tribunal providing that a tribunal of this state may modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order.  However, if the issuing state is a foreign jurisdiction that has not enacted a law or established procedures substantially similar to the procedures under this chapter, the consent otherwise required of an individual residing in this state is not required for the tribunal to assume jurisdiction to modify the child support order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state.  If 2 or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under RSA 546-B:9 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. On issuance of an order modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

A tribunal of this state shall recognize a modification of its earlier child support order by a tribunal of another state which assumed jurisdiction pursuant to a law substantially similar to this chapter and, upon request, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Enforce the order that was modified only as to amounts accruing before the modification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Enforce only nonmodifiable aspects of that order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Provide other appropriate relief only for violations of that order which occurred before the effective date of the modification.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this state and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state's child support order in a proceeding to register that order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the provisions of Articles 1 and 2, this article, and the procedural and substantive law of this state to the proceeding for enforcement or modification.  Articles 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 do not apply.

A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For purposes of this article, "governor'' includes an individual performing the functions of governor or the executive authority of a state covered by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The governor of this state may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual found in the other state who is charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) On the demand by the governor of another state, surrender an individual found in this state who is charged criminally in the other state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A provision for extradition of individuals not inconsistent with this chapter applies to the demand even if the individual whose surrender is demanded was not in the demanding state when the crime was allegedly committed and has not fled from the demanding state.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:55 Conditions of Rendition. &#150;</b>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Before making demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously, the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, or the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective.  If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand.  If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.
