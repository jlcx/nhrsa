<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tribunal of this state that has issued a support order consistent with the law of this state has and shall exercise continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its child support order if the order is the controlling order and:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:9 Determination of Controlling Child Support Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and 2 or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of this state, another state, or a foreign country with regard to the same obligor and same child, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which order controls and must be recognized:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the order of that tribunal controls.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the tribunal of this state shall issue a child support order, which controls.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If 2 or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under paragraph II.  The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification pursuant to Article 6, or may be filed as a separate proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments.  The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The tribunal that issued the controlling order under paragraph I, II, or III has continuing jurisdiction to the extent provided in RSA 546-B:7 or RSA 546-B:8.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A tribunal of this state that determines by order which is the controlling order under subparagraph II(a) or (b), or paragraph III, or that issues a new controlling order under subparagraph II(c) shall state in that order:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The amount of prospective support, if any;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited as provided by RSA 546-B:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Within 30 days after issuance of the order determining which is the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it in each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support.  A party or support enforcement agency obtaining the order that fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. An order that has been determined to be the controlling order, or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support or interest, if any, made pursuant to this section must be recognized in proceedings under this chapter.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order must be requested within 20 days after notice unless the registered order is under RSA 546-B:53-f;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:45 Contest of Registration or Enforcement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A party contesting the validity or enforcement of a registered support order or seeking to vacate the registration has the burden of proving one or more of the following defenses:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The order was obtained by fraud;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The order has been vacated, suspended, or modified by a later order;

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The issuing tribunal has stayed the order pending appeal;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) There is a defense under the law of this state to the remedy sought;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Full or partial payment has been made;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The statute of limitation under RSA 546-B:42 precludes enforcement of some or all of the alleged arrearages;  or

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a party presents evidence establishing a full or partial defense under paragraph I, a tribunal may stay enforcement of a registered support order, continue the proceeding to permit production of additional relevant evidence, and issue other appropriate orders.  An uncontested portion of the registered support order may be enforced by all remedies available under the law of this state.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:49 Modification of Child Support Order of Another State. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If RSA 546-B:51 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal may modify a child support order issued in another state which is registered in this state, if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The following requirements are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides in the issuing state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the individual parties have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support.  If 2 or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under RSA 546-B:9 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support.  The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. On the issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding paragraphs I-V and RSA 546-B:3, II, a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) One party resides in another state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The other party resides outside the United States.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) If the law of that country provides for prior notice of proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) If the law of that country does not provide for prior notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the order and an opportunity to be heard in a challenge or appeal on fact or law before a tribunal;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The order was made in violation of RSA 546-B:53-j.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously, the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.

II. If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective.  If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand.
