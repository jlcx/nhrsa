&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:3 Bases for Jurisdiction Over Nonresident. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In a proceeding to establish or enforce a support order or to determine parentage of a child, a tribunal of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual or the individual's guardian or conservator if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The individual is personally served with notice within this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The individual submits to the jurisdiction of this state by consent in a record, by entering a general appearance, or by filing a responsive document having the effect of waiving any contest to personal jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The individual resided with the child in this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The individual resided in this state and provided prenatal expenses or support for the child;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The child resides in this state as a result of the acts or directives of the individual;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The individual engaged in sexual intercourse in this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The individual asserted parentage of a child in the putative father registry maintained in this state by the department of health and human services;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) There is any other basis consistent with the constitutions of this state and the United States for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The bases of personal jurisdiction set forth in paragraph I or in any other law of this state may not be used to acquire personal jurisdiction for a tribunal of this state to modify a child support order of another state unless the requirements of RSA 546-B:49 are met, or in the case of a foreign support order, unless the requirement of 546-B:52-a are met.
