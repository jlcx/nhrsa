&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:7 Continuing, Exclusive Jurisdiction. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) As long as this state remains the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee, or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Until each individual party has filed written consent with the tribunal of this state for a tribunal of another state to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A tribunal of this state issuing a child support order consistent with the law of this state may not exercise its continuing jurisdiction to modify the order if the order has been modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a child support order of this state is modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to a law substantially similar to this chapter, a tribunal of this state loses its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction with regard to prospective enforcement of the order issued in this state, and may only:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Enforce the order that was modified as to amounts accruing before the modification;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enforce nonmodifiable aspects of that order;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide other appropriate relief for violations of that order which occurred before the effective date of the modification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A tribunal of this state shall recognize the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal of another state which has issued a child support order pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A temporary support order issued ex parte or pending resolution of a jurisdictional conflict does not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the issuing tribunal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal support order throughout the existence of the support obligation.  A tribunal of this state may not modify a spousal support order issued by a tribunal of another state having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over that order under the law of that state.
