&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this state, the responding tribunal of this state may modify that order only if, after notice and hearing, it finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The following requirements are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The child, the individual obligee, and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The child, or a party who is an individual, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal, and all of the individual parties have filed a written consent in the issuing tribunal providing that a tribunal of this state may modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order.  However, if the issuing state is a foreign jurisdiction that has not enacted a law or established procedures substantially similar to the procedures under this chapter, the consent otherwise required of an individual residing in this state is not required for the tribunal to assume jurisdiction to modify the child support order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state.  If 2 or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under RSA 546-B:9 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. On issuance of an order modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

<b>546-B:49 Modification of Child Support Order of Another State.</b>  --
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If RSA 546-B:51 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal may modify a child support order issued in another state which is registered in this state, if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The following requirements are met:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides in the issuing state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the individual parties have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support.  If 2 or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under RSA 546-B:9 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support.  The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. On the issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Notwithstanding paragraphs I-V and RSA 546-B:3, II, a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) One party resides in another state;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The other party resides outside the United States.
