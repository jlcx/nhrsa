&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a support order or income-withholding order issued in another state or a foreign support order is registered, the registering tribunal of this state shall notify the nonregistering party.  The notice must be accompanied by a copy of the registered order and the documents and relevant information accompanying the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. A notice must inform the nonregistering party:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That a registered order is enforceable as of the date of registration in the same manner as an order issued by a tribunal of this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order must be requested within 20 days after notice unless the registered order is under RSA 546-B:53-f;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That failure to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order in a timely manner will result in confirmation of the order and enforcement of the order and the alleged arrearages;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Of the amount of any alleged arrearages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the registering party asserts that 2 or more orders are in effect, a notice must also:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Identify the 2 or more orders and the order alleged by the registering party to be the controlling order and the consolidated arrears, if any;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notify the nonregistering party of the right to a determination of which is the controlling order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) State that the procedures provided in paragraph II apply to the determination of which is the controlling order;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) State that failure to contest the validity or enforcement of the order alleged to be the controlling order in a timely manner may result in confirmation that the order is the controlling order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Upon registration of an income-withholding order for enforcement, the support enforcement agency or the registering tribunal shall notify the obligor's employer pursuant to RSA 458-B.
