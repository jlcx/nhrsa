&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 546-B:43 Notice of Registration of Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a support order or income-withholding order issued in another state is registered, the registering tribunal shall notify the nonregistering party.  The notice must be accompanied by a copy of the registered order and the documents and relevant information accompanying the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The notice must inform the nonregistering party:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) That a registered order is enforceable as of the date of registration in the same manner as an order issued by a tribunal of this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) That a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order must be requested within 20 days after the date of mailing or personal service of the notice;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) That failure to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order in a timely manner will result in confirmation of the order and enforcement of the order and the alleged arrearages, and precludes further contest of that order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Of the amount of any alleged arrearages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon registration of an income-withholding order for enforcement, the registering tribunal or, if applicable, the support enforcement agency, shall notify the obligor's employer pursuant to RSA 458-B.
