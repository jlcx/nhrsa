<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A tribunal of this state may not modify a Convention child support order if the obligee remains a resident of the foreign country where the support order was issued unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The obligee submits to the jurisdiction of a tribunal of this state, either expressly or by defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first available opportunity;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The foreign tribunal lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its support order or issue a new support order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a tribunal of this state does not modify a Convention child support order because the order is not recognized in this state, RSA 546-B:53-g, III applies.
