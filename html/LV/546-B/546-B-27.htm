A verified petition, affidavit, and/or other document substantially complying with federally mandated forms, and a document incorporated by reference in any of them, not excluded under the hearsay rule if given in person, is admissible in evidence if given under oath by a party or witness residing in another state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A copy of the record of child support payments certified as a true copy of the original by the custodian of the record may be forwarded to a responding tribunal.  The copy is evidence of facts asserted in it, and is admissible to show whether payments were made.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Copies of bills for testing for parentage, and for prenatal and postnatal health care of the mother and child, furnished to the adverse party at least 10 days before trial, are admissible in evidence to prove the amount of the charges billed and that the charges were reasonable, necessary, and customary.
