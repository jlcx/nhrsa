<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

A merchant and a person accused of willful concealment by such merchant may agree to execute a civil settlement agreement for up to $400 in civil damages, plus the return of the merchandise or the replacement value of the merchandise within 60 days of the date the agreement is signed.  The form of the settlement agreement shall be as follows:
<center>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The undersigned, __________, having failed to pay for certain merchandise, more specifically described as follows __________, hereby agrees to pay, within 60 days of the date this agreement is signed, civil damages up to $400, plus the merchandise or the replacement value of the merchandise.  The parties agree that this payment shall constitute full and complete payment of damages to the following establishment __________.
