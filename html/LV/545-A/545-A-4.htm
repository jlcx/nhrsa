<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debtor:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur, debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining actual intent under subparagraph I(a), consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The transfer or obligation was to an insider;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The transfer was of substantially all the debtor's assets;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The debtor absconded;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The debtor removed or concealed assets;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) The transfer occurred shortly before or after a substantial debt was incurred;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) The debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor.
