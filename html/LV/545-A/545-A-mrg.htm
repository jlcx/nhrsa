<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) With respect to an asset that is not real property or that is a fixture, when the transfer is so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire a judicial lien otherwise than under this chapter that is superior to the interest of the transferee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected as provided in paragraph I and the transfer is not so perfected before the commencement of an action for relief under this chapter, the transfer is deemed made immediately before the commencement of the action;

III. If applicable law does not permit the transfer to be perfected as provided in paragraph I, the transfer is made when it becomes effective between the debtor and the transferee;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the asset transferred;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. An obligation is incurred:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If oral, when it becomes effective between the parties;  or

II.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notwithstanding voidability of a transfer or an obligation under this chapter, a good-faith transferee or obligee is entitled, to the extent of the value given the debtor for the transfer or obligation, to
