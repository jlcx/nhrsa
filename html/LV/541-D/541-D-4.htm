&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any non-resident or foreign non-participating manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition precedent to having its brand families listed or retained in the directory, appoint and continually engage without interruption the services of an agent in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of the Master Settlement Agreement and RSA 541-C, may be served in any manner authorized by law.  Such service shall constitute legal and valid service of process on the non-participating manufacturer.  The non-participating manufacturer shall provide the name, address, phone number, and proof of the appointment and availability of such agent to and to the satisfaction of the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The non-participating manufacturer shall provide notice to the attorney general 30 calendar days prior to termination of the authority of an agent and shall further provide proof to the satisfaction of the attorney general of the appointment of a new agent no less than 5 calendar days prior to the termination of an existing agent appointment.  In the event an agent terminates an agency appointment, the non-participating manufacturer shall notify the attorney general of said termination within 5 calendar days and shall include proof to the satisfaction of the attorney general of the appointment of a new agent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any non-participating manufacturer whose products are sold in this state, without appointing or designating an agent as herein required shall be deemed to have appointed the secretary of state as such agent and may be proceeded against in courts of this state by service of process upon the secretary of state;  however, the appointment of the secretary of state as such agent shall not satisfy the condition precedent to having its brand families listed or retained in the directory.
