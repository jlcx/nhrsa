I. Any non-resident or foreign non-participating manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition precedent to having its brand families listed or retained in the directory, appoint and continually engage without interruption the services of an agent in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of the Master Settlement Agreement and RSA 541-C, may be served in any manner authorized by law.  Such service shall constitute legal and valid service of process on the non-participating manufacturer.  The non-participating manufacturer shall provide the name, address, phone number, and proof of the appointment and availability of such agent to and to the satisfaction of the attorney general.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The non-participating manufacturer shall provide notice to the attorney general 30 calendar days prior to termination of the authority of an agent and shall further provide proof to the satisfaction of the attorney general of the appointment of a new agent no less than 5 calendar days prior to the termination of an existing agent appointment.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any non-participating manufacturer whose products are sold in this state, without appointing or designating an agent as herein required shall be deemed to have appointed the secretary of state as such agent and may be proceeded against in courts of this state by service of process upon the secretary of state;  however, the appointment of the secretary of state as such agent shall not satisfy the condition precedent to having its brand families listed or retained in the directory.

The commissioner and attorney general shall share with each other the information received under this chapter, and may share such information with other federal, state or local agencies only for purposes of enforcement of this chapter, the Master Settlement Agreement, RSA 541-C, or corresponding laws of other states.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The attorney general may require at any time from the non-participating manufacturer, proof from the financial institution in which such manufacturer has established a qualified escrow fund for the purpose of compliance with RSA 541-C of the amount of money in such fund being held on behalf of the state and the dates of deposits, and listing the amounts of all withdrawals from such fund and the dates thereof.
<br>

IV. In addition to the information required to be submitted pursuant to this section, the attorney general may require a stamping agent, distributor or tobacco product manufacturer to submit any additional information including, but not limited to, samples of the packaging or labeling of each brand family, as is necessary to enable the attorney general to determine whether a tobacco product manufacturer is in compliance with this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. To promote compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the attorney general may adopt rules requiring a tobacco product manufacturer subject to the requirements of RSA 541-C:3, I(b) to make the escrow deposits required in quarterly installments during the year in which the sales covered by such deposits are made.  The attorney general may require production of information sufficient to enable the attorney general to determine the adequacy of the amount of the installment deposit.
