&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 541-B:10 Powers and Duties of the Board. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The board shall have the power to adopt and amend all rules of procedure not inconsistent with the constitution or laws of the state, which reasonably may be necessary for the proper performance of its duties and the regulation of the proceedings before it.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, but may admit all testimony having a reasonable probative value.  It may exclude evidence which is in the opinion of the board immaterial, irrelevant or unduly repetitious.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board may subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, and also may require the production of books, papers and documents.  Any member of the board may administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses appearing before it.  Any person failing or refusing to obey any subpoena or order of the board may be proceeded against in the same manner as for refusal to obey any other subpoena.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The findings and recommendations of the board or any payment of a claim authorized by said board shall only be subject to a judicial appeal by the petitioner in accordance with RSA 541.  The board may by unanimous action order a rehearing on any matter before it, if in its opinion there are sufficient equitable reasons on behalf of any party to the proceedings so that a rehearing should be granted;  provided, however, no rehearing on any matter shall be permitted after the board has authorized a payment of a claim.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board shall adopt and have an official seal.
