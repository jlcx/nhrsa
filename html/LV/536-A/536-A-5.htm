&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 536-A:5 Show Cause Hearing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the defendant fails to appear at the preliminary hearing, a writ of replevin shall issue.  Otherwise, upon the hearing on the order to show cause, the court shall consider the showing made by the parties appearing, and shall make a preliminary determination which party, with reasonable probability, is entitled to possession, use, and disposition of the property, pending final adjudication of the claims of the parties.  If the court determines that the action is one in which a prejudgment writ of replevin should issue, it shall direct the issuance of such writ forthwith.
