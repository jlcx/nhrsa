&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 536-A:8 Writ Content. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The writ of replevin shall be directed to a sheriff, constable, or police officer within whose jurisdiction the property is located.  It shall describe the specific property to be seized, and shall specify the location or locations where, as determined by the court from all the evidence, there is probable cause to believe the property or some part thereof will be found.  It shall direct the levying officer to seize the same if it is found, and to retain it in his custody.  Upon probable cause later shown by further affidavit or declaration by applicant or someone on his behalf, filed with the court, a writ of replevin may be endorsed by the court, without further notice, to direct the levying officer to search for the property at another location or locations and to seize the same, if found.

<codesect>
The levying officer shall forthwith take the property, if it be in the possession of the defendant or his agent, and retain it in his custody, either by removing the property to a place of safekeeping or, upon good cause shown, by installing a keeper.  Provided that, when the property is used as a dwelling, such as a housetrailer, mobile home, or boat, the same shall be taken by placing a keeper in charge of the property, at the applicant's expense, for two days.  At the expiration of such period, the officer shall remove its occupants and take the property into his immediate custody.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 536-A:10 Property Within a Building. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
If the property or any part thereof is in a building or enclosure, the levying officer shall demand its delivery, announcing his identity, purpose, and the authority under which he acts.  If the property is not voluntarily delivered, he shall cause the building or enclosure to be broken open in such manner as he reasonably believes will cause the least damage to the building or enclosure, and take the property into his possession.  He may call upon any sheriff or police officer to aid and protect him, but if he reasonably believes that entry and seizure of the property will involve a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to any person, he shall refrain from seizing the property, and shall forthwith make a return before the court from which the writ issued, setting forth the reasons for his belief that such risk exists.  The court thereupon shall make such orders and decrees as may be appropriate.
