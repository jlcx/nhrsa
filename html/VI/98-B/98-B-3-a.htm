Funds appropriated for compensation of a position which is unfilled in any department, agency or instrumentality of the state may be used as full or partial compensation of any employee assigned to it as a receiving agency under title IV of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, 5 U.S.C. sections 3371-3376 as may be from time to time amended.  However, no such funds may be used to compensate such an employee in a position other than the unfilled position without the consent of the fiscal committee of the general court and, in the case of a receiving agency of the executive branch, without the consent of the governor and council.
