<center><h3>Section 102:9</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 102:9 Assessments from Firemen. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
At the beginning of each fiscal year the retirement board shall fix the assessment upon the annual salaries of all permanent firemen who accept the provisions of this chapter.  The rate of assessment shall be 5-1/2 percent of each permanent fireman's annual salary who was appointed a permanent fireman previous to July 1, 1948, unless the retirement board shall establish a different rate.  The retirement board may vary the rate, based upon actuarial tables established by it.  The retirement board may change, from time to time, the actuarial table of assessments, if it finds such change necessary, based upon periodic actuarial valuations of the retirement system.  In the cases of permanent firemen who accept this chapter or become subject thereto at ages in excess of 35 years, the retirement board shall establish individual rates of assessment based upon the respective ages of such persons and sound actuarial principles.  The board shall, in such manner as it may prescribe, give notice of the amount of assessment on each permanent fireman's salary to the treasurer or other disbursing officer of the city, town or precinct where such permanent fireman is employed.  All assessments under this section and the following section shall be payable in equal monthly installments on the last business day of each calendar month.  It shall be the duty of the treasurer or other disbursing officer of a city, town or precinct which employs permanent firemen who accept the provisions of this chapter to withhold from the monthly salary of each such permanent fireman, and to pay to the retirement board an amount equal to the monthly assessment against such permanent fireman's salary, as before provided.  All permanent firemen who shall accept the provisions hereof, by such acceptance agree that the treasurer or other disbursing officer shall have the power to withhold from their monthly salaries the amounts as aforesaid.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At the beginning of each year commencing on the first day of July the board of trustees shall certify to each employer other than the state the percentage rates of contribution due the system from each such employer, and shall assess upon each such employer such percentages of the earnable compensation of members in its employ, and it shall be the duty of the treasurer or other disbursing officer of each such employer to pay to the board of trustees such portion of the annual amount so assessed at such times and in such manner as the board of trustees may prescribe.  Each such employer is hereby authorized to appropriate the sums necessary for the payment of such assessments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The contributions of each employer for benefits under the retirement system on account of firemen members shall consist of a percentage of the earnable compensation of its members to be known as the "normal contribution'', and an additional amount to be known as the "accrued liability contribution'';  provided that any employer, other than the state, shall pay 65 percent of such total contributions, and 35 percent thereof shall be paid by the state;  and provided further that in case of firemen members employed by the state, the state shall pay both normal and accrued liability contributions.

<center><h3>Section 102:11</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 102:11 Normal Contribution Rate. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The normal contribution rate shall be determined as the uniform and constant percentage of the annual salary of the average new permanent fireman entering the system which, if contributed on the basis of his salary throughout his entire period of active service would be sufficient, together with the assessment provided in RSA 102:9, to provide for the payment of any benefit payable on his account under this chapter.  The accrued liability contribution shall be determined by the actuary as the amount necessary to liquidate the unfunded accrued liability as of June 30, 1968 over a period of 20 years from that date.  The unfunded accrued liability is the amount of the total liabilities of the system which is not dischargeable by the funds in hand, the assessment and the normal contribution.  After the determination of the unfunded accrued liability as of June 30, 1968, the normal contribution shall be determined after each actuarial valuation as the rate percent of the annual salary of each participating permanent fireman obtained by deducting from the total liabilities of the system the amount of the funds in hand, the present value of future assessments and the then current unfunded accrued liability and dividing the remainder by one percent of the present value of the future salaries of all permanent firemen who are then participating in the system.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Option 1.  A reduced retirement allowance payable during the retired member's life, with the provision that it shall continue after his death for the life of the beneficiary, nominated by him by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the retirement board at the time of retirement.

III. If either of the options under paragraphs I or II is elected the following conditions and restrictions shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the designated joint annuitant should die before the member's attainment of his retirement age, the election shall become inoperative and annuity payments, if and when commenced, will be on the normal retirement benefit basis under RSA 102:15, as though an optional form of annuity had never been elected;

(b) If the member should die before attainment of his retirement age, the joint annuitant shall not be entitled to receive any annuity payments;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The designation of any person as a joint annuitant shall not constitute such person a beneficiary with respect to any other benefit provided under this chapter, unless such person is specifically designated as a beneficiary under other provisions hereof.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 102:17 In Case of Death or Disability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A permanent fireman accepting the provisions of this chapter, who shall have become permanently disabled from fire duty, because of injury received in line of duty, shall receive an annual sum equal to 2/3 his annual salary as defined in RSA 102:15, and in case of call, volunteer, or substitute firemen, who become permanently and totally disabled because of injury received in line of fire duty, an annual sum not to exceed $1,250 per year.  Firemen shall be acknowledged as performing their duty while actually covering a tour of duty within the station assigned, going to, returning from or working at a fire or other public emergency;  when performing all work within the scope of employment of the firemen under the expressed or implied authority of a superior officer;  and in such other cases as the board may from time to time decide to be for the public interest.  The fact of permanent disability may be established by the certificate of physician designated by the board.  In case a fireman accepting the provisions hereof shall die as the result of injury received in line of duty, his widow or if none, his minor child or children shall receive an annual sum equal to the compensation allowed for disability for either permanent or call firemen, as the case may be, until in case of a widow, she dies or remarries, or, in case of a minor child or children, the board in its discretion shall pay such sum as a joint and survivor annuity, until such child dies or attains the age of 18 years, and in case there is no wife, child or children under age 18 surviving such member, then to his totally dependent father or mother, or both, and the survivor of either one of them, as the board in its discretion shall determine, during dependency, and until remarriage of either.

<center><h3>Section 102:18</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 102:18 Ordinary Disability;  Medical Examination. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the application to the retirement board of a member in active service, any member who has 15 or more years of creditable service may be retired on an ordinary disability retirement allowance consisting of an annual sum equal to 2/3 his average final salary as defined in RSA 102:15;  provided that the physician or physicians designated by the board certify that he is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that he should be retired.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Once each year during the first years following the retirement of a member on a total and permanent disability, or ordinary disability retirement, and once in every 3-year period thereafter, the board may require any disability beneficiary, who has not attained age 65, to undergo a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the board.  If any disability beneficiary, who has not attained age 65, refuses to submit to such medical examination, his retirement may be discontinued by the board, until his withdrawal of such refusal;  and, if his refusal continues for more than a year, all his rights in and to his pension may be revoked by the board.  If the physician or physicians designated by the board report and certify that the disability beneficiary is again able to engage in fire duty, his retirement allowance shall be continued until such time as the community from which he is retired is able to retire him.  On his reinstatement to active service, his rate of assessment shall be the same as assessed against him previous to the date of his disability, and his period of disability shall be considered as part of continuous service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the retirement board finds that any member retired on an ordinary disability allowance under this section is engaged in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between his annual retirement allowance and the annual amount of compensation currently payable for the job classification last held by the beneficiary prior to his disability retirement, then his disability shall be deemed to have diminished and his retirement allowance shall be reduced to an amount which, together with the annual amount earnable by him, shall equal the annual amount of compensation currently payable for the job classification last held by the disabled beneficiary.  Such reduction shall not be made if the disabled beneficiary demonstrates to the satisfaction of the retirement board that the annual compensation currently earnable by him does not exceed the difference between his retirement allowance and the annual amount of compensation currently payable for the job classification which he last held prior to his disability retirement.  If his earnings from such gainful occupation are later changed, his retirement allowance may be further modified by the retirement board;  provided, however, that his retirement allowance shall at no time exceed the original grant nor an amount which when added to the amount being earned by him equals the annual amount of compensation currently payable for the job classification last held prior to his disability retirement.  It shall be the responsibility of the retired member to file with the retirement board, annually on a date determined by the board, proof of the annual amount of compensation currently earnable by him and of the annual amount of compensation currently payable for the job classification last held by him prior to his disability retirement.  The provisions of this section governing adjustments or discontinuance of a member's disability retirement allowance shall apply proportionally in like manner to any benefits which may thereafter become payable to the beneficiary named under any option elected under the provisions of RSA 102:16.

Prior service credit shall be only for his period of actual active service.  His rate of assessment upon reinstatement shall be as provided under RSA 102:9.  Notice of dismissal or death, not due to fire duty as described in RSA 102:17, of a permanent fireman who has accepted the provisions of this chapter, shall be sent to the board by the chief clerk or other responsible officer of city, town or precinct by whom said fireman was employed.
