&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Annual Leave.  All full-time, nonelective unclassified legislative officials and employees shall accumulate annual or biennial leave to the extent authorized for each position by the appointing authority.  If, at the time of his separation from service, such an official or employee has credit for unutilized annual leave time, he shall be paid for such time at the same rate he was receiving at the time of his separation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Sick Leave.  All full-time, nonelective unclassified legislative officials and employees, shall accumulate sick leave credit to the extent authorized for each position by the appointing authority.  All unutilized sick leave credit shall lapse at the time of separation from service, except that should such an official or employee die while in service, his estate shall be paid for any unutilized sick leave credit at the same rate the official or employee was receiving at the time of his death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Transfer of Credit.  Any official or employee who transfers without a break in service, from the classified service to a full-time, nonelective, unclassified legislative position may transfer all the days of sick leave credit and annual leave credit that he has accumulated in the classified service.  Any full-time, nonelective unclassified legislative official or employee who transfers, without a break in service, to the classified service may transfer all the days of sick leave credit and annual leave credit that he has accumulated in the unclassified service pursuant to this section.  The rate of accrual for all sick and annual leave shall be the same as the rate immediately prior to the transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The appointing authority may deny compensation to any legislative official or employee for any annual leave time or sick leave time taken in excess of annual leave time or sick leave time accumulated pursuant to this section.
