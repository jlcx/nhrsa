&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 101:1 Declaration of Policy. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In order to extend to employees of the state and its political subdivisions and to the dependents and survivors of such employees, the basic protection accorded to others by the old-age and survivors insurance system embodied in the Social Security Act, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the general court, subject to the limitations of this chapter, that such steps be taken as to provide such protection to employees and officials of the state and its political subdivisions on as broad a basis as is permitted under the Social Security Act, except as may be otherwise specifically limited herein.  It is also the policy of the legislature that the protection afforded employees in positions covered by a retirement system on the date an agreement under this chapter is made applicable to service performed in such positions, or receiving periodic benefits under such retirement system at such time, will not be impaired as a result of making the agreement so applicable or as a result of legislative enactment in anticipation thereof.

I. Federal-State Agreement.  The state agency, with the approval of the governor and council, is hereby authorized to enter on behalf of the state into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security, consistent with the terms and provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of extending the benefits of the federal old-age and survivors insurance system to employees of the state or any political subdivision thereof with respect to services specified in such agreement which constitute "employment'' as defined in RSA 101:2.  Such agreement may contain such provisions relating to coverage, benefits, contributions, effective date, modification of the agreement, administration, and other appropriate provisions as the state agency and Commissioner of Social Security shall agree upon, but, except as may be otherwise required by or under the Social Security Act as to the services to be covered, such agreement shall provide in effect that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Benefits will be provided for employees whose services are covered by the agreement and their dependents and survivors on the same basis as though such services constituted employment within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The state will pay to the Internal Revenue Service, at such time or times as may be prescribed under the Social Security Act, contributions with respect to wages equal to the sum of the taxes which would be imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act if the services covered by the agreement constituted employment within the meaning of that act;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Such agreement or modification of the agreement shall be effective with respect to services performed after an effective date specified in such agreement or modification;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) All services which constitute employment hereunder and are performed in the employ of the state by employees of the state, shall be covered by the agreement;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) All services which (a) constitute employment as defined in RSA 101:2, (b) are performed in the employ of a political subdivision of the state, and (c) are covered by a plan which is in conformity with the terms of the agreement and has been approved by the state agency under RSA 101:5, shall be covered by the agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Interstate Instrumentalities.  Any instrumentality jointly created by this state and any other state or states is hereby authorized, upon the granting of like authority by such other state or states, (1) to enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security whereby the benefits of the federal old-age and survivors' insurance system shall be extended to employees of such instrumentality, (2) require its employees to pay and for that purpose to deduct from their wages contributions equal to the amounts which they would be required to pay under RSA 101:4, I if they were covered by an agreement made pursuant to paragraph I of this section, and (3) to make payments to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with such agreement, including payments from its own funds, and otherwise to comply with such agreements.  Such agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be consistent with the terms and provisions of said paragraph I and other provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. New Hampshire Retirement System.  Pursuant to section 218(d)(6) of the Social Security Act, the New Hampshire retirement system shall, for the purposes hereof, be deemed to constitute a separate retirement system with respect to the state and a separate retirement system with respect to each political subdivision which has, or on September 1, 1954, had positions covered thereby, provided however, that in the case of any such political subdivision which has no employees eligible to vote in a referendum, as eligibility is defined in section 218(d)(3) of the Social Security Act, such political subdivision shall be deemed a part of another political subdivision having positions covered by the New Hampshire retirement system as the governor may designate, and the New Hampshire retirement system, with respect to any combination of political subdivisions so formed, shall likewise be deemed a separate retirement system.

I. Each political subdivision of the state is hereby authorized to submit for approval by the state agency a plan for extending the benefits of title II of the Social Security Act, in conformity with applicable provisions of such act, to employees of such political subdivision.  Each such plan and any amendment thereof shall be approved by the state agency if it finds that such plan, or such plan as amended, is in conformity with such requirements as are provided in rules of the state agency, except that no such plan shall be approved unless:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) It provides that all services which constitute employment as defined in RSA 101:2 and are performed in the employ of the political subdivision by employees thereof, shall be covered by the plan;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) It provides for such methods of administration of the plan by the political subdivision as are found by the state agency to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the plan;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) It provides that the political subdivision will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the Internal Revenue Service may from time to time require, and comply with such provisions as the Internal Revenue Service or Commissioner of Social Security may from time to time find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Each political subdivision required to make payments under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is authorized, in consideration of the employee's retention, or entry upon, employment after enactment of this chapter, to impose upon each of its employees, as to services which are covered by an approved plan, a contribution with respect to wages not exceeding the amount of the employee tax which would be imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act if such services constituted employment within the meaning of that act, and to deduct the amount of such contribution from wages as and when paid.  Contributions so collected shall be paid to the Internal Revenue Service in partial discharge of the liability of such political subdivision or instrumentality under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.  Failure to deduct such contribution shall not relieve the employee or employer of liability therefor.

In the case of the referendum with respect to the employees of the state, the conduct thereof shall be governed by such rules as the governor, after consultation with the respective representatives of employee organizations, shall approve.  The notice of referendum required by section 218(d)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act to be given to employees shall contain or shall be accompanied by a statement, in such form and such detail as the governor shall deem necessary and sufficient, to inform the employees of the rights which will accrue to them and their dependents and survivors, and the liabilities to which they will be subject, if their services are included under an agreement under this chapter.

II. Certification.  Upon receiving satisfactory evidence that with respect to any such referendum the conditions specified in section 218(d)(3) of the Social Security Act have been met, the governor shall so certify to the Commissioner of Social Security.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Order of Referenda.  No referendum shall be held hereunder with respect to the employees of any political subdivision until the referendum authorized herein with respect to the employees of the state shall have been conducted and the result thereof determined.  In the event that the employees of the state in said referendum shall vote in favor of including service in positions covered by the New Hampshire retirement system with respect to the state under an agreement under this act, the governor, upon the determination of such vote and without further directive or request, shall forthwith authorize a referendum with respect to each of the political subdivisions having positions covered by the New Hampshire retirement system.
