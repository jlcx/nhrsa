&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 103:7 Assessment on Salaries. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The retirement and other compensation provided for by this chapter shall be paid out of a retirement fund, which shall consist of all moneys collected from assessments or appropriations or gifts provided for herein.  At the beginning of each fiscal year the board shall fix the applicable rate of assessment upon the annual salaries of all permanent policemen who accept the provisions hereof.  Unless and until changed by the board, such rate of assessment shall be 6- 85/100 percent of each policeman's annual salary, except, that in the case of any policeman employed by a city having a population of more than 34,000 inhabitants and until the governing body of said city shall elect to discontinue its present policy of paying a supplementary retirement benefit to any permanent policeman employed by the city who may thereafter be granted a retirement benefit under the provisions of the New Hampshire Policemen's Retirement System, no assessment shall be made upon that part of his annual salary in excess of $2,400.  The board shall, in such manner as it may prescribe, give notice of the rate and amount of assessment of each permanent policeman's salary to the treasurer or other disbursing officer of the state, city, town, village or precinct where such permanent policeman is employed.  All assessments under this section shall be payable in equal monthly installments on the last business day of each calendar month.  It shall be the duty of the treasurer or other disbursing officer of the state, city, town, village or precinct, employing permanent policemen, who accept the provisions hereof, to withhold from the monthly salary of each permanent policeman and to pay the board an amount equal to the monthly assessment against such permanent policeman's salary, as before provided.  All permanent policemen who shall accept the provisions hereof by such acceptance agree that the treasurer or other disbursing officer of the state, city, town, village or precinct which employs them shall have the power to withhold from their monthly salaries the amounts aforesaid.  Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, any policeman who is over 35 years of age at the time he accepts the provisions of this chapter shall be assessed by the board on the part of his annual salary which would have been assessable had he been under age 35 on the date of such acceptance, at the increased rate determined in accordance with the following table:

<codesect>
In addition to the assessment made on the assessable part of any policeman's annual salary as hereinbefore provided, and subject to the approval of the board and to such rules and regulations as the board may prescribe with respect thereto, any permanent policeman may provide for himself an additional retirement allowance by making special deposits in his individual account.  Such special deposits together with interest credited thereon as determined by the board shall be paid to him upon resignation or dismissal from service, or to his estate or his designated beneficiary upon his death before retirement.  Upon his retirement for any cause, his accumulated special deposits shall be returnable to him in cash, or, at his election, part or all of such accumulated special deposits may be taken as a monthly annuity of equivalent actuarial value;  provided such annuity together with his regular monthly retirement allowance shall not exceed a sum equal to  1/2 his average monthly salary during the 12-month period preceding his retirement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 103:9 Contributions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At the beginning of each year commencing on the first day of July the board of trustees shall certify to each employer other than the state the percentage rates of contribution due the system from each such employer, and shall assess upon each such employer such percentages of the earnable compensation of members in its employ, and it shall be the duty of the treasurer or other disbursing officer of each such employer to pay to the board of trustees such portion of the annual amount so assessed at such times and in such manner as the board of trustees may prescribe.  Each such employer is hereby authorized to appropriate the sums necessary for the payment of such assessments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The contributions of each employer for benefits under the retirement system on account of police members shall consist of a percentage of the earnable compensation of its members to be known as the "normal contribution'';  and an additional amount to be known as the "accrued liability contribution'';  provided that any employer, other than the state, shall pay 65 percent of such total contributions, and 35 percent thereof shall be paid by the state;  and provided further that in case of police members employed by the state, the state shall pay both normal and accrued liability contributions.

<center><h3>Section 103:10</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 103:10 Normal Contribution Rate. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The normal contribution rate shall be determined as the uniform and constant percentage of the annual salary of the average new permanent policeman entering the system which, if contributed on the basis of his salary throughout his entire period of active service would be sufficient, together with the assessment provided in RSA 103:7, to provide for the payment of any benefit payable on his account under this chapter.  The accrued liability contribution shall be determined by the actuary as the amount necessary to liquidate the unfunded accrued liability as of June 30, 1968 over a period of 20 years from that date.  The unfunded accrued liability is the amount of the total liabilities of the system which is not dischargeable by the funds in hand, the assessment and the normal contribution.  After the determination of the unfunded accrued liability as of June 30, 1968, the normal contribution shall be determined after each actuarial valuation as the rate percent of the annual salary of each participating permanent policeman obtained by deducting from the total liabilities of the system the amount of the funds in hand, the present value of future assessments and the then current unfunded accrued liability and dividing the remainder by one percent of the present value of the future salaries of all permanent policemen who are then participating in the system.

This sum shall be payable until, in the case of a widow, she dies, or remarries, or in the case of a minor child or children, they die or reach the age of 18 years, but if there is no wife, child or children under the age of 18 years, surviving such policeman, then to his totally dependent father or mother, or both, or the survivor of them, as the board shall determine, during dependency.  In case the widow dies without remarrying and leaves a minor child or children, the payment shall continue until such minor child or children die or reach the age of 18 years or marry before reaching the age of 18 years.  Said sums shall be paid in equal monthly installments on the first business day of each calendar month.  Should such deceased policeman leave no widow, minor child or children, or totally dependent father or mother, his estate or designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive from the retirement fund all payments made thereto by him, without interest.  In case a permanent policeman, accepting the provisions hereof, shall die not as the result of injury received in line of duty, his widow, or, if none, his living child or children under age 18 shall receive, in addition to the amount payable under RSA 103:16, a lump sum equal to $3,600, except in the case of a policeman employed by a city having a population of more than 34,000 inhabitants, in which case the lump sum shall not exceed the amount of the assessed part of his annual salary at his death.
