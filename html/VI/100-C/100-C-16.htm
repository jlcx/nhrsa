<codesect>
 Any person who knowingly makes any false statement or falsifies or permits to be falsified any record or records of the judicial retirement plan in any attempt to defraud the system as a result of such act, shall be guilty of a class B felony if a natural person, or guilty of a felony if any other person.  Should any change or error in the records result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the plan more or less than such person would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the board of trustees shall have the power to correct such error, and to adjust as far as practicable the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.
