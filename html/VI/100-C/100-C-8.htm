&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon the death of a member who does not have a surviving spouse or dependent children, after retirement allowance payments have commenced, any excess amount of the member's accumulated contributions at retirement over the sum of the retirement allowance payments received shall be paid in one sum to the beneficiary or beneficiaries nominated by the member, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
