<codesect>
Retired judges and their applicable spouses who are not Medicare eligible and receiving medical and surgical benefits shall be responsible for payment of a premium contribution amount based on a percentage of the total monthly premium attributable to the applicable retiree and/or spouse, as determined by the commissioner of administrative services, with prior approval by the fiscal committee of the general court, provided the percentage is not lower than 12.5 percent.  The department of administrative services shall provide information as to the total monthly premium cost for each participant to the judicial retirement plan for purposes of calculating this deduction.  The judicial retirement plan shall deduct the payment required under this section from the retiree's monthly retirement allowance.  Deducted amounts shall be remitted to the administrative office of the courts within 14 days along with a statement identifying from whom the deduction was made, and shall be used to pay for plan retiree and spouse health care expenses and any administrative costs related thereto.
