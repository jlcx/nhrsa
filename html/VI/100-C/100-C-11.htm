&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The judicial retirement plan shall be administered by a board of trustees, which shall be separate from the board of trustees of the New Hampshire retirement system.  The board of the judicial retirement plan shall have the exclusive authority and full power to administer and to invest and manage those assets of the judicial retirement plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of trustees of the judicial retirement plan shall consist of 7 members.  The governor and council shall appoint 2 trustees, one of whom the governor shall designate to serve as chairman of the board of trustees, and who shall be qualified persons with business experience and not members of the judicial retirement plan, and who shall serve for a term of 3 years and until such trustee's successor is appointed and qualified, except that the original appointment of one of the trustees shall be for a term of one year.  The chief justice of the state supreme court, with the advice and consent of the chief justice of the superior court, the administrative judge and deputy administrative judge of the circuit court, and the director of the administrative office of the courts, shall appoint 3 trustees, at least 2 of whom shall be active members of the judicial retirement plan and one of whom may be a retired member, and who shall serve for a term of 3 years and until such trustee's successor is appointed and qualified, except that the original appointment of one of the trustees shall be for a term of one year, and the original appointment of another of the trustees shall be for a term of 2 years.  One member of the state senate shall be appointed biennially by the senate president as a trustee of the board, and one member of the house of representatives shall be appointed biennially by the speaker of the house as a trustee of the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) In addition to those other powers conferred herein, the board of trustees shall have exclusive authority and full power, consistent with the board's duties under this chapter, to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Establish an administrative budget sufficient to exercise the board's powers and to perform the board's duties and, as appropriate and reasonable, draw upon assets of the plan to fund the budget;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Obtain by employment or contract the services necessary to exercise the board's powers and perform the board's duties, including actuarial, auditing, custodial, investment, and legal services;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Procure and dispose of goods and property necessary to exercise the board's powers and perform the board's duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In exercising its authority under this section, the board shall be subject to the fiduciary duties of this chapter, but not to civil service, personnel, procurement, or similar general laws relating to the subjects of subparagraph III(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The members of the board of trustees shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary traveling and other expenses and disbursements incurred or made by them in the discharge of their official duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote in the board of trustees.  Four trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business.  In the event of only four trustees voting at any meeting, a unanimous vote shall be necessary for any resolution or action by the board at such meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) The board may engage such administrative services as may be required to transact the business of the judicial retirement plan.  The compensation for such services, and all other necessary expenses of the board shall be paid at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall approve.  The New Hampshire retirement system may be engaged to provide such administrative services to the judicial retirement plan on such terms as the board of trustees of each plan may both agree.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The board may delegate functions, including the administration of the plan, that a prudent trustee acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters could properly delegate under the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The board shall exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution in:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Periodically reviewing the agent's performance and compliance with the terms of the delegation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) In performing a delegated function, an agent owes a duty to the judicial retirement plan and to its members and beneficiaries to comply with the terms of the delegation and, if a fiduciary, to comply with the duties imposed by this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A trustee of the board who complies with subparagraphs (b) and (c) shall not be liable to the plan or to its members or beneficiaries for the decisions or actions of the agent to whom the function was properly delegated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
