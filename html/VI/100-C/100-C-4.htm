The board shall fix and determine by appropriate rules how much service in any year is equivalent to one year of service, but in no case shall it allow credit for a period of absence without pay of more than a month's duration, nor shall more than one year of service be creditable for all service in a calendar year.  Service rendered for the full normal working time in any year shall be equivalent to one year's service.
