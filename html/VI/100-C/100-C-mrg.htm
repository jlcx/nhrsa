&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-C:12 Fiduciary Duties of Board of Trustee in Investing and Managing Assets of Judicial Retirement Plan. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The members of the board of trustees shall be the trustees of all funds of the judicial retirement plan created under this chapter and shall have full power to invest, and reinvest such funds, subject to all the terms, conditions, limitations, and restrictions herein.  Each member of the board of trustees or other fiduciary shall discharge duties with respect to the plan:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Solely in the interest of its members and beneficiaries;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and beneficiaries and paying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) With the care, skill, and caution under the circumstances then prevailing which a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of an activity of like character and purpose;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Impartially, taking into account any differing interests of members and beneficiaries;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Incurring only costs that are appropriate and reasonable;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) In accordance with a good-faith interpretation of the law governing the judicial retirement plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In investing and managing assets of the judicial retirement plan, the board of trustees:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Shall consider among other circumstances:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) General economic conditions;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The possible effect of inflation or deflation;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of capital;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or appreciation of capital;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The adequacy of funding for the plan based on reasonable actuarial factors;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Shall diversify the investments of the plan unless the board reasonably determines that, because of special circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the investment and management of assets of the plan;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) May invest in any kind of property or type of investment consistent with the fiduciary provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The contribution shall be used for the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries and in no event shall revert to the state unless the reversion is due to a good faith mistake of fact or law.  The board may return a member or state contribution, or make alternative arrangements for reimbursement, if the board determines the contribution was made because of a mistake of fact or law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. In evaluating the performance of a trustee or other fiduciary of the plan, compliance by the trustee or other fiduciary with those duties and liabilities under this chapter shall be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the trustee or fiduciary's decision or action and not by hindsight;  and the board's investment and management decisions shall be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the trust portfolio as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board of trustees may insure against liability or losses occurring because of a breach of duty hereunder if the insurance is purchased or provided either by the trustee or fiduciary personally or, on the trustee or fiduciary's behalf, by the state, the plan, the employer whose members participate in the plan, or the trustee or fiduciary's employer.

<center><h3>Section 100-C:13</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-C:13 Method of Financing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. All of the assets of the judicial retirement plan shall be credited, according to the purpose for which they are held, between 2 funds, namely, the member annuity savings fund and the state annuity accumulation fund.  In making the determinations required under this section for financing the judicial retirement plan, the board shall determine and use an appropriate actuarial funding methodology.  The board shall direct the plan's actuary to prepare biennial valuations of the system's assets and liabilities commencing with a valuation prepared as of the date of implementation of this chapter.  Such biennial valuation shall be the sole basis for determining the annual contribution requirements of the judicial retirement plan until the next following biennial valuation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Member Annuity Savings Fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The member annuity savings fund shall be a fund in which shall be accumulated the contributions deducted from the compensation of members to provide for their member annuities.  The board of trustees shall certify to the proper authority responsible for making up the payroll of the judicial branch, and such authority shall cause to be deducted from the compensation of each member, on each and every payroll for each and every payroll period, the percentage of earnable compensation applicable to such member.  In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the board may consider the rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of a payroll period as continuing throughout the payroll period and it may omit deduction from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if such person was not a member on the first day of the payroll period, and to facilitate the making of deductions it may modify the deduction required of any member by such an amount as shall not exceed  1/10 of one percent of the annual earnable compensation upon the basis of which such deduction is made.  The amounts deducted shall be reported to the board.  Each of such amounts, when deducted, shall be paid to the judicial retirement plan at such times as may be designated by the board and credited to the individual account, in the member annuity savings fund, of the member from whose compensation the deduction was made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions provided in this section as a condition of membership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The accumulated contributions of a member withdrawn by such member, or paid to such member's estate or to such member's designated beneficiary in event of the member's death in service, shall be paid from the member annuity savings fund.  Upon the retirement of a member, such member's accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the member annuity savings fund to the state annuity accumulation fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. State Annuity Accumulation Fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The state annuity accumulation fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated all reserves for the payment of all state annuities payable from contributions made by the state, any amounts transferred to the fund from a similar fund under one or more of the predecessor systems, and amounts transferred from the member annuity savings fund and from which shall be paid all benefits payable under the plan other than those payable from the member annuity savings fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The contributions of the state for benefits under the judicial retirement plan shall consist of a percentage of the earnable compensation of its members to be known as the "normal contribution,'' and an additional amount to be known as the "accrued liability contribution.''  The rate percent of such normal contribution in each instance shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the plan with respect to its members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Commencing with the valuation as required in paragraph I, the actuary in determining the percentage normal contribution rate may include a projection of the membership, earnable compensation, and assets of the judicial retirement plan from the valuation date to the beginning of the year to which such percentage normal contribution rate is applicable;  or the actuary may base such determination on the anticipated level of contribution as is necessary to maintain such reasonable actuarial funded ratio as may be directed by the board of trustees, and for purposes of this determination the actuarial funded ratio shall be the ratio of the fair market value of the judicial retirement plan's assets to the present value of accumulated benefits under the judicial retirement plan for all members, but without regard to any future compensation increase.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Immediately following the actuarial valuation prepared under paragraph I, the board shall have an actuary determine the amount of the unfunded accrued liability as the amount of the total liabilities of the state annuity accumulation fund which is not dischargeable by the total of the funds in hand to the credit of the state annuity accumulation fund, and the normal contributions to be made on account of the members during the remainder of their active service.  The amount so determined shall be known as the "unfunded accrued liability.''  On the basis of the unfunded accrued liability, the board shall have an actuary determine the level annual contribution required to discharge such amount over a period of 30 years from January 1, 2010 or the maximum period allowed by standards adopted by the Government Accounting Standards Board, whichever is less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The total amount payable to the state annuity accumulation fund in each year shall not be less than the normal contribution rate multiplied by the total compensation earnable by all members for such year, plus the amount of the accrued liability contribution necessary to liquidate the unfunded accrued liability as determined by the actuary under subparagraph (d) above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) All interest and dividends earned on the funds of the judicial retirement plan shall be credited to the state annuity accumulation fund.  The board shall allow interest at such rate or rates as it shall determine from time to time on the individual accounts of members in the member annuity savings fund and shall annually transfer such interest amount from the state annuity accumulation fund.  Such interest shall be compounded annually or more frequently as the board of trustees may determine and shall be allowed to the date of processing upon termination of active service for any reason including withdrawal, retirement, or death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The board of trustees shall be permitted to pay out to, or for the benefit of, retired members retired after January 1, 2005 or their beneficiaries, supplemental benefits as provided in RSA 100-C:17, not to exceed $50,000 in the aggregate per calendar year.  Said benefits shall be on a nonrecurring basis.  Supplemental benefits greater than $50,000 per calendar year in the aggregate shall only be paid if the judicial retirement annuity accumulation fund earns at a level greater than the actuarial assumed rate of return approved by the board and the trust is at least 90 percent funded for that calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. State Contributions.  On or before the first day of October preceding each regular session of the state legislature, the board of trustees shall certify to the commissioner of administrative services the amounts which will become due and payable by the state during the biennium next following to the judicial retirement plan and it shall be the duty of the commissioner of administrative services in preparing the executive budget for each ensuing biennium to include in the budget the amounts so certified which amounts shall be appropriated by the legislature.  The amounts so certified under this paragraph shall include the unfunded accrued liability of the judicial retirement plan;  provided, however, that if bonds are issued to fund or eliminate the unfunded accrued liability, the payments of principal and interest for the bonds or notes shall be made from the general fund.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-C:14 Member Contributions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
 All member contributions to the judicial retirement plan shall be payable only with respect to membership service, and picked up by the state by means of payroll deduction and shall be treated as employer contributions for purposes of Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The member contribution rate shall be fixed biennially by the board of trustees and shall be calculated so that the rate percent of earnable compensation deducted is one-half of the annual contribution requirements of the judicial retirement plan as determined in RSA 100-C:13, I.  In no year shall the member contribution rate exceed 10 percent of a member's earnable compensation.  Once a member attains eligibility for a service retirement allowance equal to 75 percent of the member's final year's salary pursuant to RSA 100-C:5, said member shall not be required to have deductions made from earnable compensation for purposes of this section provided that the state contributions for such member under RSA 100-C:13, IV shall continue until the member's retirement.

Should any change or error in the records result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the plan more or less than such person would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the board of trustees shall have the power to correct such error, and to adjust as far as practicable the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.
