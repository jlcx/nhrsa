<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the plan is terminated in its entirety, or if the sponsor's contributions are discontinued, and not merely suspended, the fund shall be used subject to the payment of expenses, for the benefit of members and beneficiaries and for no other purpose until all contribution repayments to members and beneficiaries for contributions payable under the plan to the date of termination or discontinuance of contributions have been satisfied.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the fund is insufficient to satisfy all contribution repayments in full, then the assets of the fund shall be applied in the following order:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) To provide to each member an amount equal to the member's contributions, with credited interest thereon, to the earliest of the member's contribution repayment date, or the date of termination, reduced by the amount of any payments made to such member, which amount shall reduce the amounts necessary to provide contribution repayments set forth in subparagraphs (2)-(4).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Class 1:  Retired members and other members who have attained their benefit dates.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Class 2:  Members who have terminated volunteer service with the sponsor, or could have terminated such service, with a right to termination benefits for themselves or their beneficiaries under RSA 100-B:4.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Class 3:  All remaining members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Each of the foregoing classes, with the exception of Class 1, shall be determined as of the date of termination of the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) If upon the application of the assets of the fund in the order of priority to provide payment in part of liabilities to members and beneficiaries in one of the 3 classes, there are assets available for that class but not sufficient to satisfy such liabilities in full, the assets available for that class shall be applied on the basis of the proportions which the available assets bear to the current values of the accrued benefits of all members and beneficiaries in that class.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon the termination of the plan, the fund shall continue in existence and the assets shall be applied to the benefit of the several classes, or the fund may be distributed to each member or beneficiary of the current value of what such member or beneficiary is entitled to receive.  These payments shall be made in installments over a period of 3 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. After the fulfillment of all obligations to members and their beneficiaries provided for in this section, any portion of the fund remaining shall be returned to the governing body of the municipality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-B:13 Miscellaneous. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If any person to whom a contribution is repayable from the fund is a minor, or any person to whom such benefit is payable is incompetent by reason of physical or mental disability, any payment due, unless a proper claim shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator or legal representative, may be made to the member's spouse, child, parent, or brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the committee to have incurred expenses for such person otherwise entitled to payment.  Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of any liability for such payment under the plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Members and beneficiaries shall be entitled to all the contribution repayments specifically set out under the terms of the plan, but to the extent permitted by law, the contribution repayments or any of the property rights in the benefits shall not be assignable or distributable to any creditor or other claimant of such member or beneficiary.  No member or beneficiary shall have the right to anticipate, assign, pledge, accelerate, or in any way dispose of any of the moneys or benefits or other property which may be payable to them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. All contribution repayments under the plan shall be paid or provided for solely from the fund, and a sponsor assumes no liabilities or responsibilities for benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Neither the action of a sponsor in the establishment of this plan or any action taken by it or by the committee shall be construed as giving any member the right to be retained in such status or any other right whatsoever except to the extent of the contribution repayments provided by the plan to be paid or made available from the fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If any provisions of this chapter or the application thereof is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Whenever reasonable efforts fail to locate any member or beneficiary entitled to contribution repayments under the plan within 7 years from the time notice is first received that the member or beneficiary is not to be found at the address in the records of the sponsor, or the trustee, the committee may direct that any contribution repayments to which such person may be entitled shall thereupon be cancelled and no payment shall be made thereafter to anyone with respect to the benefits so cancelled.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Forfeitures arising from death, termination of service, or otherwise under the plan shall not be applied to increase the contribution repayments any member would otherwise receive under the plan prior to the plan's termination but shall be used as soon as possible to enhance the principal assets of the plan.
