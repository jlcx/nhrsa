(1) To provide to each member an amount equal to the member's contributions, with credited interest thereon, to the earliest of the member's contribution repayment date, or the date of termination, reduced by the amount of any payments made to such member, which amount shall reduce the amounts necessary to provide contribution repayments set forth in subparagraphs (2)-(4).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
