<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) 25 percent of group II employer contributions made for group II;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in RSA 100-A:54, II, all contributions made to the retirement system to provide medical benefits under RSA 100-A:52 shall be maintained in a separate account, the 401(h) subtrust, and such funds shall not be used for or diverted to any purpose other than to provide said medical benefits.  Similarly, none of the funds accumulated to provide the retirement benefits set forth in this chapter, including the special account established under RSA 100-A:16, II(h), may be used or diverted to provide medical benefits under RSA 100-A:52.  The funds, if any, accumulated to provide medical benefits under RSA 100-A:52 may be invested pursuant to the provisions of RSA 100-A:15.
