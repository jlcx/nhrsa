&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:19-c Service Retirement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding the retirement age requirements set forth in RSA 100-A:5, any member of the retirement system who has creditable service in both group I and group II, and who has attained the minimum age set forth in RSA 100-A:19-b, may retire on a service retirement allowance upon application as provided in RSA 100-A:5, I(a) or II(a).  The split-benefit retirement allowance shall be determined as the sum of the retirement allowances with respect to service in each group classification computed as follows:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The average final compensation shall be as defined in RSA 100-A:1, XVIII, computed on the basis of the entire period of service in both classifications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The group I portion of the retirement allowance shall be as provided in RSA 100-A:5, I(b), based on the number of years of creditable service in group I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The group II portion of the retirement allowance shall be as provided in RSA 100-A:5, II(b), based on the number of years of creditable service in group II.
