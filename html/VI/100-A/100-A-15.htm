<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An analysis of the return on investment, by investment category.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) An annual investment policy statement which shall incorporate the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A clear statement of investment objectives including the adoption of a reasonable and sound expected rate of return the retirement system is attempting to earn.  The expected rate of return utilized for the statement of investment objectives shall bear some reasonable relationship to the assumed rate of return set by the trustees for the biennial actuarial calculation.  The retirement system's actuaries shall issue a written opinion in regard to the reasonableness of the assumed rate of return that shall address any difference between the assumed rate of return and the expected rate of return.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A detailed breakdown of the asset structure most likely to enable the fund to reach its long range objective within appropriate risk parameters.

The policy statement should specify the minimum frequency to review outcomes and responsibilities, in order to determine whether decisions as to asset mix and manager selection added value to the fund.  Investment managers should be under frequent review by the investment committee and the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any suggested changes in legislation which the board may seek in order to better serve the members of the system.  This is not intended to preclude the board of trustees from seeking additional legislation as needs arise between annual reports.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The management, investment, and reinvestment practices for the assets held in trust by the board pursuant to this section shall be subject to review by the legislature.
<br>
