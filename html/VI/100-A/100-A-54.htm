However, if after the satisfaction of all medical benefits provided under RSA 100-A:52 there remain any funds, the program shall be deemed to be terminated and such remainder shall be returned to the appropriate employer, as defined in RSA 100-A:1, IV, in accordance with section 401(h)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII.
