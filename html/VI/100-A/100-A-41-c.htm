&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. An eligible retired group I member of the New Hampshire retirement system whose annual retirement allowance is less than $8500 shall receive a one-time supplemental allowance sufficient to provide an annual allowance of $8500. An eligible retired group I member shall be a member, or beneficiary of such member, who retired prior to July 1, 1991 with at least 20 years of creditable service under RSA 100-A:5, I, or member, or beneficiary of such member, who retired under RSA 100-A:6, I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The one-time supplemental retirement allowance payable to each beneficiary of the member shall be determined as described in paragraph I except the specified amount of $8,500 shall be multiplied by the ratio of the beneficiary's annual retirement allowance to the member's annual retirement.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to a group I member who has retired on a reduced or vested deferred retirement allowance.  The additional allowance shall become a permanent addition to each member or beneficiary's base retirement allowance, as provided in RSA 100-A:41-a.
