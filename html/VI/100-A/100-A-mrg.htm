&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:3 Membership. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) Any person who becomes an employee, teacher, permanent policeman, or permanent fireman after the date of establishment, working in a position for an employer under this chapter as determined by common law standards, shall become a member of the retirement system as a condition of employment.  In addition, employees appointed to an unclassified position with no fixed term on or after July 1, 2011 shall become members of the retirement system as a condition of employment, if they are receiving benefits from the retirement system.  Any retirement benefit collected by such an unclassified employee shall be suspended during the period of employment.  Membership in the retirement system shall be optional in the case of elected officials, officials appointed for fixed terms, employees appointed to an unclassified position with no fixed term prior to July 1, 2011, or those employees of the general court who are eligible for membership in the retirement system.  Elected officials and officials appointed for fixed terms shall, however, be eligible for membership in the retirement system only under the following conditions:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The office held is a full-time position with eligibility for the same fringe benefits as other full-time employees of the employer;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The office held is the primary occupation of the person holding the office;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The base rate of annual compensation for the office held is at least $15,000, and requires at least 1,700 hours of employment;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The official satisfies the condition under subparagraphs (1)-(3) by using only one elected or appointed office to qualify.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Notwithstanding subparagraph (4), an official who concurrently holds the offices of town clerk and tax collector for the same employer, and who is eligible for the same fringe benefits as other full-time employees of the employer, may satisfy the conditions under subparagraphs (2)-(3) by using both offices to qualify.  Such official shall be allowed to continue membership in the retirement system if already enrolled, if the hours and salary of the combined offices meet the requirements for membership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any employee who is currently an employee of the general court who works on a full-time basis and who is eligible for other state benefits, but whose salary was or is calculated on a per diem basis shall be eligible to exercise those buy-back provisions set forth in RSA 100-A:3, VI(a), (b), and (c) for such previous service, only if the employee is currently a member in the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The option in subparagraph (a) shall not be available in the case of any newly created positions for unclassified employees or officials whether appointed with fixed terms or with no fixed terms nor in the case of any newly appointed positions created by political subdivisions after July 1, 2011.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Any person who is elected or appointed for a fixed term on or after July 1, 1989, and for whom membership in the retirement system is optional under paragraph I, shall be given by his employer written notice within a reasonable time after election or appointment of his option to join the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II, II-a. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-b. If any employment position is changed in classification from group I to group II for any reason, such change shall not apply to any service in such position rendered prior to the effective date of the action effecting the change in classification, but the person holding such position shall thereafter be a group II member of the retirement system and upon retirement, death, or termination of service shall be entitled to split benefits as provided in RSA 100-A:19-a through 19-h.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-c. If any employment position is changed in classification from group II to group I for any reason, a person holding such position who has completed 5 years creditable service in group II shall continue to be a group II member of the retirement system for as long as the member holds that position or a related position reached through normal career-path promotion.  Any other person who has less than 5 years creditable service in group II and whose position is reclassified from group II to group I shall thereafter be a group I member of the retirement system and upon retirement, death, or termination of service shall be entitled to split benefits as provided in RSA 100-A:19-a through 19-h.  Any other person holding the position or who may hold it thereafter shall be a group I member of the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The board of trustees may, in its discretion, accept as members any class of employees, teachers, permanent policemen or permanent firemen whose compensation is only partly paid by an employer or who are serving on a temporary or other than per annum basis, and it may also, in its discretion, make optional with employees, teachers, permanent policemen or permanent firemen in any such class their individual entrance into membership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-b. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 100-A:1, VII, any permanent police officer certified under RSA 188-F:22-30 as a full-time police officer, who has been a group II member for at least 5 years and who becomes a law enforcement training specialist or who has been a group II member for at least 10 years and becomes assistant director or director of the police standards and training council and as a job requirement has satisfied minimum standards as determined by the police standards and training council for physical condition, education and training shall be construed to be a permanent policeman for purposes of membership in group II and shall remain in the system for the duration of his or her service in that capacity with the police standards and training council.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-c. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 100-A:1, VIII, any permanent fireman who has been a group II member and who has 10 years' fire service experience, or any person included in the definition of "fire service personnel'' as defined in RSA 21-P:25, II(c) who has 10 years' fire service experience, who is or becomes the director of the division of fire safety, the director of the division of homeland security and emergency management, the director of the division of fire standards and training and emergency medical services, any fire instructor, supervisor, instructor, or other technical specialist who has hazardous materials, firefighting, or rescue training functions and who has as a job requirement satisfied the fire standards and training commission's entrance and certification requirements for physical condition, education, and training shall be construed to be a permanent fireman for the purposes of membership in group II and shall remain in the system for the duration of service in that capacity with the fire standards and training commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The board of trustees shall require from any employer of employees, teachers, permanent policemen or permanent firemen covered by the retirement system such information relative to name, title, compensation, date of birth and length of service of each of its employees, teachers, permanent policemen and permanent firemen as the board may deem necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A member shall cease to be a member if (a) he or she withdraws his or her accumulated contributions;  or (b) he or she becomes a beneficiary or dies.  The board of trustees shall continue the membership of a member while in the armed forces of the United States provided such member does not withdraw his or her accumulated contributions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, if any member who is an employee of a political subdivision withdraws his accumulated contributions and ceases to be a member within 6 months of the initial date of his employment, the accumulated contributions of the employer made during that 6-month period shall be returned to that political subdivision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) If a member of this system or a predecessor system ceases to be a member and withdraws his accumulated contributions, and later again becomes a member and wishes to receive prior service credit for the previous time served as a member, or if a member wishes to receive prior service credit for a period during which he was employed in a temporary, unclassified, or nonclassified capacity, or in any nonpermanent full-time employment prior to becoming a member, the member may petition the board of trustees to obtain an actuary's statement indicating the costs, provided that such prior service shall have a duration of 6 months or more and further provided that the member agrees to pay for the statement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of prior service credit for time served as a member for which the member's accumulated contributions have been withdrawn, the amount of creditable service purchased may be the full length of service relating to the withdrawn contributions or a partial share of such service.  The amount determined by the actuary to reinstate full or partial service credit shall be the amount of withdrawn contributions, but not less than one month's contributions multiplied by the ratio of the service credit to be purchased to the full length of service relating to the withdrawn contributions, with this amount adjusted for interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of payment based on the interest rates in effect for each fiscal year.  The amount determined by the actuary to purchase prior service credit related to Peace Corps and AmeriCorps service shall be computed under RSA 100-A:4, VIII.  For all other prior service credit the amount determined by the actuary shall be the full actuarial cost of service credit determined by the actuary based on methods and assumptions recommended by the actuary and approved by the board of trustees.  The member may be required to prepay all or part of the actuarial calculation fee, as determined by the board.  Credit shall not be granted until the active member has fully paid for such service credit in a lump sum or by installment payments as permitted by the board.  The member's payment shall be credited to the member annuity savings fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except for service described in subparagraph (d), in no case shall prior service purchased as credible service in the New Hampshire retirement system under the provisions of this section be deemed to be creditable service for the purposes of eligibility for medical benefits after retirement under the provisions of RSA 21-I:30, RSA 100-A:52, RSA 100-A:52-a, or RSA 100-A:52-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d)(1) In the case of an employer which through its own fault, and not the fault of the employee, failed to enroll an eligible employee at the time such employee became eligible for membership in this retirement system or a predecessor system, the employer and not the employee shall pay the cost of the actuary's statement obtained under this subparagraph.  The actuary's statement shall be based on the product of the member's annual rate of compensation at the time of buy-in, multiplied by the sum of the member and employer contribution rates in effect with respect to the member at the time of buy-in, multiplied by the number of years of prior service credit bought.  In addition, if such employee has not received final approval of the board before July 1, 1989, to receive credit for such service, the employer shall pay  1/2 of the amount determined by the actuary and the employee shall pay  1/2.  Upon payment, and with the approval of the board, the member shall receive credit for prior service.  The amount paid by the employee for prior service credit under this subparagraph shall be credited to the member annuity savings fund, and the amount paid by the employer shall be credited to the state annuity accumulation fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For the purposes of subparagraph (d) with respect to service rendered after June 30, 1989, only, any case of failure to enroll a person after June 30, 1989, for whom membership is compulsory under the provisions of this chapter shall be presumed to be the fault of the employer.  With respect to prior service rendered after June 30, 1989, only, any case of failure to enroll a person for whom membership is optional under the provisions of this chapter shall be presumed to be the fault of the employer in the absence of documentary evidence of the person's election.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) In any case under subparagraph (d) in which the employee is required to pay a portion of the amount determined by the actuary, if the employee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the board that the employee is financially incapable of paying the employee portion of the amount determined by the actuary, then the employer shall pay the employer portion of the amount determined by the actuary directly to the employee, and the employee shall not receive credit for such prior service.  The employee shall be eligible to receive such payment directly from the employer only if and when the employee would have been eligible for present or vested future benefits resulting from such period of prior service if the prior service had been membership service.  If the employee is in service with the employer and is not eligible for such direct payment from the employer when a petition under this subparagraph is granted, then the employer shall hold the amount payable in escrow and shall pay it to the employee when the employee becomes so eligible, but upon termination of service with the employer, if the employee is still not eligible for such direct payment, the obligation to pay and all rights relating thereto shall terminate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A petition for prior service credit under subparagraph (a) shall be filed by a member and shall be filed prior to said member's retirement or death.  A petition for prior service credit under subparagraph (d) shall be filed within 3 years after the end of the period for which prior service credit is requested.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The board of trustees shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to permitting employees to pay the amount determined by the actuary under subparagraph (d) on an installment basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Temporary Assignment to Another Department;  Compensation.  Any permanent policeman in service who is, at the time of his death or disability, working for some other than his own police department or a component of the state or federal government on a temporary assignment shall be compensated as though he was working for his own department and shall receive the same benefits that would have accrued to him if he had been working for his own department, provided that the policeman was working with the knowledge and approval of his commanding officer, police chief, selectmen, or city or town manager.  This section shall apply to any permanent policeman working under cover, on emergency duty or in a training capacity.  In the event such temporary assignment should exceed 10 working days, it shall be the obligation of the receiving agency of the assignee to insure that all member and employer contributions as required by RSA 100-A are properly transmitted to the New Hampshire retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The board of trustees of the New Hampshire retirement system shall accept as members of the system all Maine-New Hampshire Interstate Bridge Authority employees, who, pursuant to RSA 234:65, are transferred to the department of transportation, whether or not the employees are currently members of the New Hampshire retirement system.  Acceptance shall be with full credit for service while employees of the Authority, and shall be conditional only upon the payment, within a period of time agreeable to the board of trustees of the New Hampshire retirement system, of any funds required to finance in full the accrued retirement benefits of the employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If there is any doubt as to the proper classification of a job in the retirement system, the trustees shall determine whether the person holding the job is an employee, teacher, permanent policeman, or permanent fireman as defined in RSA 100-A:1;  provided, however, that a  2/3 vote shall be required to classify the job in group II, and further provided that in the case of a newly-created job held by more than one person, the job shall be classified in group I unless it is explicitly placed in group II by the legislation creating the job in the case of a state job, or by a majority vote of the legislative body of the political subdivision in the case of a political subdivision job.  For the purposes of this paragraph, an increase in the number of persons holding a given job with a given employer shall not be considered as creation of a new job.  No job shall be reclassified from group I to group II of the retirement system without legislation specifically authorizing a transfer from group I to group II.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:4 Creditable Service. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. With respect to service rendered prior to the date of membership, each employee, teacher, permanent policeman or permanent fireman who has become a member of the New Hampshire retirement system following prior service in any predecessor system, shall have included as creditable service hereunder all service credited to him under the terms of one or more of the predecessor systems, provided his membership continues unbroken until his retirement.  Should the employee, teacher, permanent policeman or permanent fireman whose membership is broken again become a member, he shall enter the retirement system as a member not entitled to such prior service credit, except as provided in RSA 100-A:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Creditable service at retirement on which the retirement allowance of a member shall be based shall consist of his membership service since he became a member or since he last became a member in the event of a break in membership, and the prior service, if any, which is credited to him under paragraph I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The board shall fix and determine by appropriate rules and regulations how much service in any year is equivalent to one year of service, but in no case shall it allow credit for a period of absence without pay of more than a month's duration, nor shall more than one year of service be creditable for all service in a calendar year.  Service rendered for the full normal working time in any year shall be equivalent to one year's service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) or any other law to the contrary, any member who receives a weekly award under the provisions of RSA 281-A from the commissioner of labor, for injury arising out of and in the course of employment, shall be entitled to creditable service for said period not in excess of one year.  To receive creditable service, a member shall file a department of labor memo of payment of disability compensation form, with the board of trustees, verifying the first and last payment of disability compensation for each new unrelated injury.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-a. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph III of this section, any group I or group II member who is absent without salary due to a disability for which the member is compensated by a salary continuance plan which is funded wholly or partially by the member's employer shall continue to accrue creditable service until the earlier of such time as the member returns to work, dies, retires, is no longer compensated by such salary continuance plan, or is no longer employed by the employer.  Amounts received under such salary continuance plan are earnable compensation to the extent attributable to employer funding and shall be subject to the regular member contributions required under RSA 100-A:16 and the required employer and state contributions, if applicable, as are in effect from time to time.  All such contributions shall be remitted to the retirement system in accordance with remittance procedures of the board of trustees.  Any group I or group II member who is absent without salary due to a disability for which the member is compensated by a salary continuance plan which has not been funded in whole or in part by the member's employer shall not accrue any creditable service for the period of such absence.  Further, amounts received from such salary continuance plan shall not be included as earnable compensation for purposes of the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III-b. Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph III to the contrary, any teacher in service on or after July 1, 1995, who equally shares a job-sharing fulltime position with another teacher shall be eligible for membership in the retirement system.  Any such teacher shall accrue full creditable service for the entire period of job-sharing and shall be credited with earnable compensation at the compensation actually paid to such teacher.  Creditable service and earnable compensation for any currently active or retired teacher who shared a job-sharing teaching position with another teacher during any period prior to July 1, 1995, shall not be recalculated to conform with the provisions of this paragraph but shall remain in effect as each was originally granted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any employee, teacher, permanent policeman or permanent fireman who after the date of establishment terminated his or her employment in order to enter directly into the armed forces of the United States or other qualified military service within the meaning of section 414(u)(5) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall be entitled to service credit for the period of such qualified military service, provided he or she again becomes employed within a year after the termination of such service, unless he or she is prevented from such reemployment by virtue of disability incurred during the period of such qualified military service, and provided further that he or she elects to make, and makes within a period of time equal to 3 times the length of time of such service, but not more than 5 years, all payments to the system he or she would have been required to make had he or she been so employed during the period of such qualified military service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph IV any member who after the date of establishment terminates his or her employment in order to enter directly into the armed forces of the United States or other qualified military service of the United States and the period of such service does not exceed 3 years, shall be entitled to service credit for the period of such service, provided he or she again becomes employed within a year after termination of such service, unless he or she is prevented from such reemployment by virtue of disability incurred during the period of such service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a member in active service in the retirement system who has completed 10 years of creditable service in the state, shall be entitled to receive credit, upon payment by the member of the cost of such credit and upon approval of the board, for not more than 3 years of additional creditable service for active service in the armed forces of the United States, subject to the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The member is not receiving military retirement benefits at the time of application for such credit, other than disability allowances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The member is honorably discharged or is an officer honorably separated from the military service of the United States, or is in active status in the New Hampshire national guard or organized reserve.  A member on active status in the New Hampshire national guard or organized reserve may apply such service time on a ratio of 5 years active national guard or reserve service to one year of available additional creditable service under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The member is not at the time of application for credit receiving any retirement benefits under this chapter or under any predecessor system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Credit for active service in the armed services shall not be made until the member has paid either in lump sum or, if permitted by the board of trustees, by installment deductions from pay from an employer.  The actuary's statement shall be the product of the member's annual rate of compensation at the time of buy-in, multiplied by the sum of the member and employer contribution rates in effect with respect to the member at the time of buy-in, multiplied by the number of years of prior service credit bought.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Additional creditable service purchased under this paragraph shall not be used as creditable service for the purpose of determining service retirement eligibility or for the purpose of eligibility for medical and surgical benefits as a retired employee under RSA 21-I:30, RSA 100-A:52, RSA 100-A:52-a, or RSA 100-A:52-b.

Notwithstanding any provisions of RSA 100, RSA 100-A, or RSA 192 to the contrary, every currently active teacher teaching during the 1984-85 school year who was in service prior to July 1, 1950, but who was not in service on July 1, 1950, and who subsequently reentered service as a teacher after that date, shall be permitted to acquire full credit for all service rendered prior to July 1, 1950, as provided in paragraphs II and III.  Such teachers shall be eligible for such benefits as are provided for group I members under this chapter including credit for such prior service as is allowable under paragraphs II and III, as if they had become members of the New Hampshire teachers' retirement system at its inception, and prior to its merger with the retirement system.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Every currently active teacher teaching during the 1984-85 school year as set forth in paragraph I whose prior service does not include credit for service as a teacher which he performed before July 1, 1945, shall receive credit for all service rendered before July 1, 1945, without any payment by the teacher.

Such supplement shall be equal to 2 percent of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of his or her creditable service in excess of 33- 1/3 but not in excess of 42.5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) For group II members who have not attained vested status prior to January 1, 2012, calculation of the supplemental allowance shall use the percentage multipliers for the corresponding years of creditable service on January 1, 2012 in the transition provisions in RSA 100-A:5, II(d) with the range for the number of excess years for the supplement adjusted proportionally.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Medical Examination, Gainful Occupation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Once a year during the first 5 years following the retirement of either a group I or group II member on a disability retirement allowance, and once in every 3-year period thereafter, the board of trustees may, and upon his application shall, require any disability beneficiary who has not attained age 60 to undergo a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the board.  If any disability beneficiary who has not attained age 60 refuses to submit to such medical examination, his state annuity may be discontinued by the board of trustees until his withdrawal of such refusal, and if his refusal continues for more than one year, all his rights in and to his state annuity may be revoked by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b)(1) If the board of trustees finds that any disability beneficiary is engaged in or is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between the beneficiary's retirement allowance and the current comparable compensation, then the beneficiary's state annuity may be reduced to an amount which, together with the member annuity and the annual amount earnable, is equal to the current comparable compensation.  Such reduction shall not be made if the disabled beneficiary demonstrates to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that the annual compensation currently earnable does not exceed the difference between the beneficiary's retirement allowance and the current comparable compensation.  If the beneficiary's earning capacity is later changed, the state annuity may be further modified;  provided that the new state annuity shall not exceed the amount of the state annuity originally granted nor an amount which, when added to the amount earnable, together with the member annuity, equals the current comparable compensation.  It shall be the responsibility of the disability beneficiary to file with the board of trustees, annually on a date determined by the board, proof of the annual amount of compensation currently earnable and of the current comparable compensation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) For purposes of this subparagraph, "current comparable compensation'' means the greatest of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) The annual amount of compensation currently payable for the job classification last held by the beneficiary prior to disability retirement;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) The annual amount of compensation payable for the job classification held at the time of disability;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) The beneficiary's average final compensation increased by an amount for each year since disability retirement calculated using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The provisions of subparagraph (b)(1) shall not apply to a group II accidental disability beneficiary whose total of years of service as a member in group II plus years of accidental disability retirement is at least 20 years, as determined by the board, and who has attained the age of 45.  Any such accidental disability beneficiary shall receive retirement allowance benefits under this section without reduction for gainful occupation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Except for payments made under RSA 281-A:37 or compensation which is not earnable compensation under RSA 100-A:1, XVII, any amounts which may be paid or payable to or on account of any member or retired member on account of any disability to which the employer has made contributions under the provisions of any workers' compensation or similar law or plan shall, in such manner as the board of trustees shall determine, be offset against and payable in lieu of any state annuity on account of the same disability.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board shall have the authority to recover from any member or retired member who is a disability recipient overpayments made under this section because the disability recipient failed to notify the retirement system when the recipient began to receive workers' compensation benefits which affect the monthly disability annuity payment from the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply, notwithstanding any other provision of RSA 100-A:6 to the contrary.  The board of trustees, as the interests of justice may require, may waive the requirement that a group I or group II member be in service at the time application is made for ordinary and accidental disability retirement benefits under this section, provided that application for disability retirement benefits is made within one year of the date the member's contribution to the New Hampshire retirement system ceases.

(a) If a group I member ceases to be an employee or teacher for reasons other than retirement or death and if he or she has not elected to receive a vested deferred retirement allowance under RSA 100-A:10, the amount of his or her accumulated contributions shall be paid within 3 months after his or her written request therefor, provided that the member may not file a written request for such payment until at least 30 days from the date the member ceases to be an employee or a teacher and provided that the member may not again become a group I member during said 30-day period.  A group I member shall cease to be an active member if he or she is absent from service for more than 180 days, without requesting return of the amount of his or her accumulated contributions, and the retirement system shall retain his or her accumulated contributions.  The annual return credited on inactive, vested members shall be paid pursuant to RSA 100-A:16, II(g).  The board shall hold and invest such accumulated contributions on behalf of the inactive member, provided that the annual return credited on the inactive member's accumulated contributions shall be 2 percentage points less than either the assumed rate of return or the actual rate of return, whichever is lower, for the immediately preceding fiscal year as reported in the comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), provided the rate of return shall not be less than zero.  The inactive member may make a written request for his or her total accumulated contributions, provided he or she is not on a leave of absence, and he or she shall be paid within 3 months after his or her written request.  In the event an inactive member who has not withdrawn his or her contributions under this section returns to become an active member in service, his or her previous service shall count toward that member's creditable service to the extent that his or her accumulated contributions have remained in the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon the death of a group I member in service as a result of causes other than those which meet the requirements for an accidental death benefit as set forth in RSA 100-A:8 and if, at the time of his death, he is not eligible for service retirement or, being so eligible, is not survived by a widow, or has designated a beneficiary or beneficiaries other than his widow, the amount of his accumulated contributions shall be paid to the person or persons nominated by him, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.  Upon the death of a group I member in service under circumstances which meet the requirements for an accidental death benefit as set forth in RSA 100-A:8, the amount of his accumulated contributions shall be paid to the person or persons nominated by the member, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon the death of a group I member who has elected, pursuant to RSA 100-A:10, to receive a vested deferred retirement allowance before his attainment of age 60, the amount of his accumulated contributions at the time of his death shall be paid to the person or persons, if any, nominated by him, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon the death of a retired group I member after his retirement allowance payments have commenced, provided he has not elected an optional allowance that has become effective, any excess of the amount of his accumulated contributions at retirement over the sum of the retirement allowance payments received shall be paid in one sum to the person or persons nominated by the member, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.  Upon the death of the survivor of a retired group I member and the beneficiary nominated by him under the terms of an option, if an option was elected and had become effective, any excess of the retired member's accumulated contributions at retirement over the sum of the retirement allowance payments received by the retired member and such beneficiary shall be paid to the person nominated by the member, if living, otherwise to the estate of the last to survive of the member and such beneficiary.  Nomination of a person to receive the return of the member's contributions pursuant to this section shall be made by the member in writing filed with the board of trustees.  A member may change his nomination by a similar writing.  A designation, revocation or change of the person nominated under an optional election may be made only as provided in RSA 100-A:13.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Group II Members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If a group II member ceases to be a permanent policeman or permanent fireman for reasons other than retirement or death and if he or she has not elected to receive a vested deferred retirement allowance under RSA 100-A:10, the amount of his or her accumulated contributions shall be paid within 3 months after his or her written request therefor.  A group II member shall cease to be an active member if he or she is absent from service for more than 180 days, without requesting return of the amount of his or her accumulated contributions, and the retirement system shall retain his or her accumulated contributions.  The annual return credited on inactive, vested members shall be paid pursuant to RSA 100-A:16, II(g).  The board shall hold and invest such accumulated contributions on behalf of the inactive member, provided that the annual return credited on the inactive member's accumulated contributions shall be 2 percentage points less than either the assumed rate of return or the actual rate of return, whichever is lower, for the immediately preceding fiscal year as reported in the comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), provided the rate of return shall not be less than zero.  The inactive member may make a written request for his or her total accumulated contributions, provided he or she is not on a leave of absence, and he or she shall be paid within 3 months after his or her written request.  In the event an inactive member who has not withdrawn his or her contributions under this section returns to become an active member in service, his or her previous service shall count toward that member's creditable service to the extent that his or her accumulated contributions have remained in the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon the death of a group II member in service as a result of causes other than those which meet the requirements for an accidental death benefit as set forth in RSA 100-A:8 and if, at the time of his death, he is not eligible for service retirement or, being so eligible, is not survived by a widow, or has designated a beneficiary or beneficiaries other than his widow, the amount of his accumulated contributions shall be paid to the person or persons nominated by him, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.  Upon the death of a group II member in service under circumstances which meet the requirements for an accidental death benefit as set forth in RSA 100-A:8, the amount of his accumulated contributions shall be paid to the person or persons nominated by the member, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Upon the death of a group II member who has elected, pursuant to RSA 100-A:10, to receive a vested deferred retirement allowance before his retirement allowance commences, the amount of his accumulated contributions at the time of his death shall be paid to the person or persons, if any, nominated by him, if living, otherwise to the member's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Upon the death of the survivor of a retired group II member who is in receipt of an accidental disability retirement allowance pursuant to RSA 100-A:6 and his widow in receipt of an allowance pursuant to RSA 100-A:12, any excess of the retired member's accumulated contributions at retirement over the sum of the retirement allowance payments received by such retired member and his widow shall be paid to the person nominated by the member, if living, otherwise to the estate of the last to survive of the retired member and such widow.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Upon the death of the survivor of a retired group II member and the beneficiary nominated by him under the terms of an option, if an option was elected and had become effective, any excess of the retired member's accumulated contributions at retirement over the sum of the retirement allowance payments received by the retired member and such beneficiary shall be paid to the person nominated by the member, if living, otherwise to the estate of the last to survive of the member and such beneficiary.  Nomination of a person to receive the return of the member's contributions pursuant to this section shall be made by the member in writing filed with the board of trustees.  A member may change his nomination by a similar writing.  A designation, revocation or change of the person nominated under an optional election may be made only as provided in RSA 100-A:13.

I. Notwithstanding any other provision under this chapter to the contrary, in the event that any payment in the amount of $15,000 or less is to be made by the New Hampshire retirement system to the estate of a deceased member or beneficiary, the retirement system may, but is not required to, make payment to the next of kin of such deceased member or beneficiary provided that all of the following conditions are met:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:13 Optional Allowances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any member who has reached service retirement age as provided in RSA 100-A:5, I(a), or II(a), or RSA 100-A:19-b, any retiree within 120 days after the effective date of retirement, or any retiree within 120 days after a decision by the board of trustees granting the retiree disability retirement benefits pursuant to RSA 100-A:6, may elect to receive, instead of the retirement allowance otherwise payable, a retirement allowance of equivalent actuarial value under one of the options named in paragraph III, or to redesignate any such option previously elected.  When the member or retiree elects to receive an optional retirement allowance under paragraph III, the beneficiary or beneficiaries whom the member or retiree nominates may include the member's spouse and/or children.  The notice of non-election, election, or change of retirement option shall be on a form designated by the board, which, if the member or retiree is married, shall include a spousal acknowledgment.  The optional allowance shall be effective upon retirement if the election is made before the effective date of retirement, and on the first day of the month following receipt by the board of the notice of election or change of option if made during a 120-day grace period.  When an election or change of option is made during a 120-day grace period, no retroactive adjustments will be made in payments already received by the retiree.  When an election or change of option is made within 120 days after a decision by the board of trustees granting the retiree disability retirement benefits, the optional allowance shall be calculated using retiree and beneficiary age factors applicable as of the first day of the month following receipt by the board of the notice of election or change in option. After expiration of the 120-day grace period no change in option selection shall be permitted except as provided in paragraph II.  If a retiree dies after filing notice of election or change of option during the 120-day grace period but before the effective date, the election or change shall be effective as of the date of death.  If a member dies after filing an election for a survivorship retirement option and before the effective date of retirement, whether or not the member has filed for retirement, the beneficiary who was nominated by the member in the election of the option may elect to receive either the optional survivor benefit which the member had elected or the ordinary death benefit provided under RSA 100-A:9, whichever is more advantageous to the beneficiary;  provided that, in the case of the member's death before retirement, if the beneficiary named in the survivorship option election is not the same person as the beneficiary under RSA 100-A:9, then the death benefit under RSA 100-A:9, II, and not the survivorship option shall apply.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Any retired member who has elected option 2, 3, or 4, and whose beneficiary nominated by the retiree under such option was the retiree's spouse at the time of such election, may:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Terminate such elected option upon the issuance of a divorce decree and subsequent remarriage of the former spouse, or in accordance with the terms of the final divorce decree or final settlement agreement which provides that the former spouse shall renounce any claim to a retirement allowance under RSA 100-A.  Upon termination, the allowance received under the elected option shall be converted to the retirement allowance that would have been payable in the absence of such election.  Any supplemental allowance, or COLAs, granted to the retiree and effective before the date of termination of the option shall continue in effect and shall not be adjusted as a result of the termination.  Notice of such termination shall be given by the retiree on a form designated by the board.  Payment of the converted allowance shall commence on the first day of the month following receipt of termination by the board.  For any retiree whose divorce and the subsequent remarriage of the former spouse occurred on or before July 1, 1990, the notice shall be given to the board on or before October 1, 1990.  Said termination action shall become effective on the first day of the month following receipt of such notice by the board.  If the retiree dies after giving valid notice of such termination but before the effective date, the option shall terminate as of the date of the retiree's death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Due to the death of a former spouse and the retiree's subsequent remarriage, elect to nominate the current spouse as beneficiary under one of the options named in paragraph III. The notice of election shall be on a form designated by the board.  The optional allowance shall be effective the first of the month following receipt of the notice.  If a retiree dies after filing such notice but before the effective date, the change shall be effective as of the date of death.  The optional allowance shall be of equivalent actuarial value.  Any supplemental allowances, or COLAs, granted to the retiree before the effective date of the election shall terminate on such effective date, but the value of such COLA's shall be included in the actuarial determination of the amount of the allowance payable under the elected option.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Where a retired member has elected option 2, 3, or 4, and has designated a single beneficiary, the beneficiary may at any time voluntarily renounce his or her right to any future benefits by signing and filing with the board a form designated by the board.  Upon such renunciation, the allowance received under the elected option shall be converted to the retirement allowance that would have been payable in the absence of such election.  Any supplemental allowance, or COLAs, granted to the retiree and effective before the date of renunciation of the option shall continue in effect and shall not be adjusted as a result of the renunciation.  The renunciation shall become effective, and payment of the converted allowance shall commence, on the first day of the month following receipt of the signed form by the board.  If the retiree dies after the board's receipt of such renunciation but before the effective date, the option shall terminate as of the date of the retiree's death.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any retired member who has elected option 2, 3, or 4, and has designated a single, non-spouse beneficiary, may at any time prior to the death of the beneficiary terminate such elected option without the consent of the beneficiary by signing and filing with the board a form designated by the board.  Upon termination, the allowance received under the elected option shall be converted to the retirement allowance that would have been payable in the absence of such election.  Any supplemental allowance, or COLAs, granted to the retiree and effective before the date of termination of the option shall continue in effect and shall not be adjusted as a result of the termination.  Such termination shall become effective, and payment of the converted allowance shall commence, on the first day of the month following receipt of such form by the board.  If the retiree dies after giving notice of such termination but before the effective date, the notice shall be deemed valid, the previously elected option shall terminate as of the date of the retiree's death, and no survivor annuity shall be paid pursuant to the previously elected option.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The options, each of which shall be of equivalent actuarial value to the allowance payable in the absence of election of an option, are:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Option 1. A reduced retirement allowance payable during the retired member's life, with the provision that at the member's death a lump sum equal in amount to the difference between the accumulated contributions at the time of retirement and the sum of the member annuity payments made to the member during the member's lifetime shall be paid to the beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries, if any, nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees if such beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries survive the member, otherwise to the retired member's estate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Option 2. A reduced retirement allowance payable during the retired member's life, with the provision that it shall continue after the member's death for the life of, and to, the beneficiary nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees at the time of retirement, or as provided in subparagraph II(a)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Option 3. A reduced retirement allowance payable during the retired member's life, with the provision that it shall continue after death at  1/2 the rate paid to the member and be paid for the life of, and to, the beneficiary nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees at the time of retirement, or as provided in subparagraph II(a)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Option 4. A reduced retirement allowance payable during the retired member's life, with some other benefit payable after death, provided that such other benefit shall be approved by the board of trustees, or a reduced retirement allowance payable during the retired member's life, with some other benefit payable after death, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph II(a)(2).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:14 Administration. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The administration of this system is vested in a board of 13 trustees.  Each newly appointed or reappointed trustee shall have familiarity with or experience in finance or business management.  The state treasurer shall be an ex officio voting member of the board.  The governor and council shall appoint 4 trustees, to be known as nonmember trustees, who shall be qualified persons with investment and/or financial experience as provided in this paragraph and not be members of the system, and who shall serve for a term of 2 years and until their successors are appointed and qualified.  The nonmember trustees of the board shall have substantial experience in the field of institutional investment or finance, taking into account factors such as educational background, business experience, and professional licensure and designations.  The original appointment of the nonmember trustees shall be made to provide for staggered terms.  The remaining 8 members of the board shall consist of:  one employee member, one teacher member, one permanent police member, one permanent fireman member, and 4 employer members.  The New Hampshire state employees' association, the New Hampshire education association, the New Hampshire police association, and the New Hampshire state permanent firemen's association shall each annually nominate from their members a panel of 5 persons, all of whom shall be active members of the retirement system, no later than May 31 of each year, and the panels so named shall be filed with the secretary of state no later than June 10 of each year.  From the above named panels the governor and council shall appoint the active member trustees of the board as needed so as to maintain the representation on the board.  The governor and council shall appoint the employer members of the board with one member nominated by the New Hampshire Association of Counties, one member nominated by the New Hampshire Municipal Association, one member nominated by the New Hampshire School Boards Association, and one member to represent management of state employees.  Members appointed to the board in the manner aforesaid shall serve for a term of 2 years.  Each member so appointed shall hold office until his or her successor shall be appointed and qualified.  Whenever a vacancy occurs, the governor and council shall fill the vacancy by appointing a member who shall serve for the unexpired term.  The governor shall designate one of the nonmember trustees to serve as chairman of said board of trustees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The board of trustees shall establish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary for the proper administration of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The members of the board of trustees shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary travelling and other expenses and disbursements incurred or made by them in the discharge of their official duties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Each trustee, including the chairman, shall be entitled to one vote in the board of trustees.  Seven trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business of the board of trustees.  Seven votes shall be necessary for any resolution or action by the board at any meeting.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The board of trustees shall have the full power to employ and compensate such employees on such terms as may be necessary as charges upon the funds of the retirement system, and establish personnel policies without regard to any personnel or civil service law or personnel or civil service rule of the state.  The employees of the retirement system shall not be classified employees of the state within the meaning of RSA 21-I:49.  Notwithstanding, any individual employed by the retirement system whose employment calls for 30 hours or more work in a normal calendar week, and whose position is anticipated to have a duration of 6 months or more, shall be entitled to elect to receive such health, dental, life insurance, deferred compensation, and retirement benefits as are afforded to classified employees of the state.  Upon election by such individual, the retirement system shall pay from its funds the state's share of such benefits.  Any remaining costs of health, dental, and life insurance benefits which an individual elects to receive pursuant to this paragraph, shall be withheld from such individual's salary as a payroll deduction.  Written notice of the availability of these benefit options shall be provided to each individual upon employment by the retirement system.  It may also engage such actuarial, medical, and like services as may be required to transact the business of the system.  The compensation for such special services, and all other expenses of the board necessary, hereto, shall be paid at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall approve.  Service as an employee of the retirement system shall be creditable service for purposes of RSA 21-I:30.  Any retirement system employee who transfers, without a break in service, to a state classified service position shall transfer all the days of sick leave credit and annual leave credit that the retirement system employee has accumulated pursuant to this section.  At the time of such a transfer, the employee shall immediately begin to accrue annual and sick leave as granted at the time of the transfer by the receiving agency according to the employee's continuous years worked.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V-a. The board of trustees shall have the power to purchase, receive, take by grant, gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise acquire, own, hold, improve, employ, use, and otherwise deal in and with property or any interest therein, whether tangible or intangible, for the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The board of trustees shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for actuarial valuation of the various funds of the retirement system and for checking the experience of the system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The board of trustees shall keep a record of all its proceedings.  It shall annually make a report showing the fiscal transactions of the retirement system for the preceding fiscal year, the amount of the accumulated cash and securities of the system and the last balance sheet showing the financial condition of the system by means of an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system, and shall file the same with the secretary of state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII-a. The board of trustees shall submit a report each quarter by January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1, to the chairpersons of the house and senate executive departments and administration committees.  Such report shall describe recent board actions including any changes to actuarial assumptions and investment returns.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Immediately after the establishment of the retirement system, the board of trustees shall adopt mortality and service tables for use in all calculations in connection with the system, and shall certify the rates of contribution payable under the provisions hereof.  The board of trustees shall also determine from time to time the rate or rates of regular interest for use in all calculations, except as otherwise provided, with the rate of 4 percent per annum compounded annually applicable from the date of establishment until changed by the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. In 1970, and at least once in each 5-year period thereafter, the board shall have an actuary make an actuarial investigation into the mortality, service and compensation experience of the members and beneficiaries of the retirement system, and a valuation of the assets and liabilities of its funds, and taking into account the result of such investigation and valuation, the board shall adopt such mortality, service and other tables as shall be deemed necessary, and certify the rates of contribution payable under the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. On the basis of regular interest and the tables last adopted by the board of trustees, the board shall have an actuary make periodic valuations of the contingent assets and liabilities of the funds of the retirement system.  Such valuations shall be prepared at least once in each 2-year period commencing June 30, 1977.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. The board of trustees shall annually notify each active member of the amount of his earnable compensation, contributions deducted, and interest credited on his contributions during the previous fiscal year;  the total of his member annuity savings fund;  his date of birth;  his accrued service credits;  and such other information as the board of trustees believe will inform the member of his status in the system.  The notice shall be prepared prior to the end of each calendar year based on information through June 30 of such year.  The first notice shall be due by December 31, 1976.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:16 Method of Financing. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
All of the assets of the retirement system shall be credited, according to the purpose for which they are held, between 2 funds, namely, the member annuity savings fund and the state annuity accumulation fund.  Each of the funds shall be subdivided on account of the various member classifications.  In making the determinations required under this section for financing the retirement system, the board of trustees shall use the entry age normal funding methodology.  The board of trustees shall direct the system's actuary to prepare biennial valuations of the system's assets and liabilities commencing with the valuation prepared as of June 30, 2007.  Such biennial valuation shall be the basis for determining the annual contribution requirements of the system until the next following biennial valuation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Member Annuity Savings Fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The member annuity savings fund shall be a fund in which shall be accumulated the contributions deducted from the compensation of members to provide for their member annuities together with any amounts transferred thereto from a similar fund under one or more of the predecessor systems.  Such contribution shall be, for each member, and except as provided in RSA 100-A:16, II-a, dependent upon the member's employment classification at the rate determined in accordance with the following table:
<PRE>
 (1) Group I members, 7.00 
 
 (2) Group II permanent fireman members, 11.80 
 
 Group II permanent police members, 11.55 
</PRE>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(aa) The board of trustees shall certify to the proper authority or officer responsible for making up the payroll of each employer, and such authority or officer shall cause to be deducted from the compensation of each member, except group II members who are in vested status before January 1, 2012 with creditable service in excess of 40 years, and group II members who commenced service on or after July 1, 2011 or who have not attained vested status prior to January 1, 2012 with creditable service in excess of 42.5 years as provided in RSA 100-A:5, II(b) and RSA 100-A:6, II(b), on each and every payroll of such employer for each and every payroll period, the percentage of earnable compensation applicable to such member.  No deduction from earnable compensation under this paragraph shall apply to any group II member who is in vested status before January 1, 2012 with creditable service in excess of 40 years, and any group II member who commenced service on or after July 1, 2011 or who have not attained vested status prior to January 1, 2012 with creditable service in excess of 42.5 years as provided in RSA 100-A:5, II(b) and RSA 100-A:6, II(b), and this provision for such members shall not affect the method of determining average final compensation as provided in RSA 100-A:1, XVIII.  In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the board may consider the rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of a payroll period as continuing throughout the payroll period and it may omit deduction from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if such person was not a member on the first day of the payroll period, and to facilitate the making of deductions it may modify the deduction required of any member by such an amount as shall not exceed  1/10 of one percent of the annual earnable compensation upon the basis of which such deduction is made.  The amounts deducted shall be reported to the board of trustees.  Each of such amounts, when deducted, shall be paid to the retirement system at such times as may be designated by the board of trustees and credited to the individual account, in the member annuity savings fund, of the member from whose compensation the deduction was made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The deductions provided for herein shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided for by law for any member shall be reduced thereby.  Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions herein provided as a condition of his membership.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The accumulated contributions of a member withdrawn by the member, or paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary in event of his or her death in service, shall be paid from the member annuity savings fund.  Upon the retirement of a member, his or her accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the member annuity savings fund to the state annuity accumulation fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) With respect to all employees of any employer, such employer may pick up the employee contributions required by this section for all compensation earned after July 1, 1983;  and the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining federal tax treatment under the United States Internal Revenue Code;  however, each employer shall continue to withhold federal income tax based upon these contributions until the Internal Revenue Service, or the federal courts, rule that, pursuant to section 414(h) of the United States Internal Revenue Code (1954), as amended, these contributions shall not be included as gross income of the employee until such time as they are distributed or made available.  The employer shall pay these employee contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the employee.  The employer may pick up these contributions by a reduction in the cash salary of the employee.  Employee contributions picked up shall be treated for all purposes of this section in the same manner and to the same extent as employee contributions made prior to the date picked up.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. State Annuity Accumulation Fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The state annuity accumulation fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated all reserves for the payment of all state annuities payable from contributions made by employers, any amounts transferred thereto from a similar fund under one or more of the predecessor systems, and amounts transferred from the member annuity savings fund, and from which shall be paid all benefits payable under the system other than those payable from the member annuity savings fund.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The contributions of each employer for benefits under the retirement system on account of group II members shall consist of a percentage of the earnable compensation of its members to be known as the "normal contribution,'' and an additional amount to be known as the "accrued liability contribution;'' provided that beginning with state fiscal year 2013 and for each state fiscal year thereafter, any employer shall pay the full amount of such total contributions.  The rate percent of such normal contribution, including contributions on behalf of group II members whose group II creditable service is in excess of 40 years, in each instance shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the system with respect to the particular members of the various member classifications as shown by actuarial valuations, except as provided in subparagraph (i).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The contributions of each employer for benefits under the retirement system on account of group I members shall consist of a percentage of the earnable compensation of its members to be known as the "normal contribution,'' and an additional amount to be known as the "accrued liability contribution;'' provided that beginning with state fiscal year 2013 and for each state fiscal year thereafter, any employer shall pay both normal and accrued liability contributions.  The rate percent of such normal contribution in each instance shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the system with respect to the particular members of the various member classifications as shown by actuarial valuation, except as provided in subparagraph (i).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c-1) For state fiscal year 2012, the contributions of each employer for benefits under the retirement system on account of group II and group I teacher members of employers other than the state shall be calculated as provided in subparagraphs (b) and (c) provided that the state shall pay $3,500,000 of such total contributions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) [Repealed.]
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Immediately following the actuarial valuation prepared as of June 30 of each fiscal year, the board shall have an actuary determine the amount of the unfunded accrued liability for each member classification, proportionally reduced using sums dedicated as provided in RSA 21-I:95, II, as the amount of the total liabilities of the state annuity accumulation fund on account of such classification which is not dischargeable by the total of the funds in hand to the credit of the state annuity accumulation fund on account of such classification, and the aforesaid normal contributions to be made on account of the members in such classification during the remainder of their active service.  The amount so determined with respect to each member classification shall be known as the "unfunded accrued liability'' with respect to such classification.  On the basis of each such unfunded accrued liability, the board shall have an actuary determine the level annual contribution required to discharge such amount over a period of 30 years or the maximum period allowed by standards adopted by the Government Accounting Standards Board, whichever is less.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The total amount payable to the state annuity accumulation fund in each year on account of each member classification shall not be less than normal contribution rate multiplied by the total compensation earnable by all members in such classification for such year, plus the amount of the accrued liability contribution necessary to liquidate the unfunded accrued liability on behalf of such classification as determined by the actuary under subparagraph (e) above.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) At the beginning of each year commencing on the first day of July the board of trustees shall certify to each employer other than the state the percentage rates of contribution due the system from each such employer, and shall assess upon each such employer such percentages of the earnable compensation of members in its employ, and it shall be the duty of the treasurer or other disbursing officer of each such employer to pay to the board of trustees such portion of the annual amount so assessed at such times and in such manner as the board of trustees may prescribe.  Each such employer is hereby authorized to appropriate the sums necessary for the payment of such assessments.  The annual employer contribution requirements effective July 1, 2008 and as calculated each year thereafter shall not be less than the employee contribution rates under RSA 100-A:16, I(a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Such certification shall in all other respects be based upon the data and assumptions used to calculate the state employer rate as certified in September 2008.  In no event shall the board of trustees certify a rate in any subsequent year based upon payments made from the medical plan subtrust to the state prior to July 1, 2009.

For reasonable cause, the board may abate all or any part of the interest.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Every employer shall report monthly to the retirement system all compensation of group II members that is attributable to extra or special duty.  When an employer provides extra or special duty services, the employer shall include in its billing or charge to the entity for whom the extra or special duty is being provided the full amount of contributions required under RSA 100-A:16, II(b) attributable to the extra or special duty.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the employer shall be responsible for the full amount of employer contributions required under RSA 100-A:16, II(b) attributable to extra or special duty.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, employers may be subject to a penalty of up to $25 per day for noncompliance with the data reporting requirements of subparagraph (a), including data that was not timely remitted or data that cannot be processed at the times designated by the board of trustees due to data reporting errors by the employer.  Before a penalty is assessed, the board shall notify the employer in writing of the noncompliance, identifying the reasons for the finding of noncompliance, and shall request the employer to explain to the board in writing within 30 days of the notification how the noncompliance occurred.  Upon expiration of the 30 day period, the board may impose all or a portion of the penalty provided for in this paragraph, unless there is a showing that the employer did not willfully, intentionally, through gross negligence, or through a pattern of negligence fail to file the data as required.

I. The governing board of any county, city, town, school district, school administrative unit or other political subdivision of the state may, by resolution legally adopted, in form approved by the board of trustees, elect to have its officers and employees become eligible to participate in the retirement system.  After such election, such body shall be known as an employer for purposes of this chapter.  The board of trustees shall set the date when the participation of the officers and employees of any employer shall become effective, and then such officers and employees may become members and participate herein, as provided in this subdivision.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, employees of any employer who are members of one or more of the predecessor systems and who have not elected, pursuant to RSA 100-A:3, to become members shall not be entitled to become members;  and employees who are members of any local retirement system other than a local retirement system for teachers shall be entitled to become members only as provided in RSA 100-A:21.  "Local retirement system'' for purposes of this subdivision shall mean any retirement system or other arrangement for the payment of retirement benefits in existence at the time of passage of this chapter, which is supported wholly or in part by public funds, exclusive of the predecessor systems as defined in RSA 100-A:1.

I-a. The governing body of any school district that has elected pursuant to paragraph I to have its employees participate in the retirement system may also elect to have employees participate in the New Hampshire retirement system who are employed in paraprofessional or support positions requiring direct involvement with students, such as the positions of classroom, academic, teacher, special education, library, or health aide/assistant, and who meet the minimum participation standards for full-time teachers as provided in rules adopted by the board of trustees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Any governing board, as aforesaid, or authority which pursuant to either RSA 100:29 or 100:30 of the employees' retirement system of the state of New Hampshire elected to have its officers and employees become eligible to participate in that system and became an employer, as therein defined, shall, by virtue of said election become an employer as herein defined.  Any members of that system, in the employ of such political subdivision or authority who, pursuant to the terms of RSA 100-A:3, elect to become members of this system as of January 1, 1968 or July 1, 1968, shall have the shares credited to their account in the employee annuity savings fund and the state annuity accumulation fund of said employees' retirement system transferred to the member annuity savings fund and the state annuity accumulation fund of the retirement system, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of RSA 100-A:16.  Thereafter, all contributions on behalf of such members shall be made by such employer and member to the retirement system.

Any cash and securities to the credit of the local retirement system shall be transferred to the retirement system as of the date participation begins.  The trustees or other administrative head of the local retirement system as of the date of participation shall certify the proportion of any of the funds of the local retirement system that represents the accumulated contributions of the members and the relative shares of the members as of that date.  Such shares shall be credited to the respective annuity savings account of such members in the retirement system as additional contributions.  The balance of the funds transferred to the retirement system shall be offset against the accrued liability before determining the special accrued liability contribution to be paid by the employer as provided by RSA 100-A:24.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Employees who have become members of the retirement system under the provisions of this subdivision shall contribute at the same rates of contribution and on the same basis as state employees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Employers whose employees become members of the retirement system under the provisions of this subdivision shall make contributions in behalf of their employees corresponding to the contributions which the state makes in behalf of state employees, except that each employer shall make a special accrued liability contribution, which shall be determined by an actuarial valuation of the accrued liability on account of the employees of such employer who elect to become members, in the same way as the accrued liability contribution is determined for state employees.  The accrued liability contribution, as so determined, shall be payable by each employer in lieu of the accrued liability contribution payable by the state on account of state employees.  The expense of making the valuation to determine the accrued liability upon which the annual contribution shall be based shall be assessed against and paid by the employer or employers on whose account the valuation is necessary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The contributions payable by employers whose employees participate in the retirement system shall be certified by the board of trustees to the chief fiscal officer of the employer and shall include a pro rata share of the cost of administration of the retirement system based upon the payroll of the employees of the employer who are members.  The amounts so certified shall be a charge against the employer.  The chief fiscal officer of each such employer shall pay to the state treasurer the amount certified by the board of trustees as payable under the provisions of this subdivision, and the state treasurer shall credit such amounts to the appropriate funds of the retirement system.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The agreement of any employer to contribute on account of its employees shall be irrevocable, but should an employer for any reason become financially unable to make the contributions payable on account of its employees as set forth in this subdivision, then such employer shall be deemed to be in default.  All members of the retirement system who were employees of such employer at the time of default shall thereupon be entitled to discontinue membership and to a refund of their previous contributions upon demand made within 90 days thereafter.  As of a date 90 days following the date of such default, the board shall have an actuary determine by actuarial valuation the amount of the reserves held on account of each remaining active member and beneficiary of such employer and shall credit to each such member and beneficiary the amount of reserves so held.  The reserves so credited, together with the amount of the accumulated contributions of each such active member, shall be used to provide for him a paid-up deferred annuity beginning at age 65, and the reserve of each beneficiary shall be used in providing such part of his existing retirement allowance as the reserve so held will provide, which retirement allowance shall thereafter be payable to him.  The rights and privileges of both active members and beneficiaries of such employer shall thereupon terminate, except as to the payment of the deferred annuity so provided and the retirement allowance, or parts thereof, provided for the beneficiaries.

There shall be no age limit to participate in the medical and health benefits provided in paragraph I, and there shall be no physical examination or health statement required for such coverage, provided, however, that if an eligible retired group II member of the retirement system fails to apply for such coverage within the time required by the insurance contract, the insurer may require satisfactory evidence of insurability as a condition for becoming insured.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Any group II member retired before July 1, 1988, or surviving spouse, who would have been eligible for medical benefits under this section if this section had been in effect on the member's date of retirement, shall have the option of re-joining the medical or health plan sponsored by the retired member's former employer and of receiving benefits under this section, provided that such retired member or surviving spouse shall apply to the employer for such benefits before July 1, 1989.  Upon receipt of such application, the former employer shall enroll such retiree or other eligible person in the employer's plan in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as enrollment of a new employee but without any benefit-waiting period which may be applicable to new employees of that employer.  Neither an employer nor an employer's group plan or insurer shall be liable for any claims incurred prior to the date of enrollment under this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. The retirement system shall notify all group II retirees and surviving spouse beneficiaries, who are currently drawing monthly allowances from the retirement system, of their possible right to re-join an active-employee medical insurance or health plan and to receive benefits under this section, and shall provide assistance to them in the preparation of the necessary application.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any person who is eligible to receive group insurance or other medical benefits under the provisions of this section, but who does not need and who declines such benefits because they would be duplicative of coverage under any employer-sponsored plan, shall nevertheless continue to be eligible and, upon ceasing to be eligible for the other coverage, shall be permitted to receive the benefits allowable under this section without any waiting period.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:54 Miscellaneous Provisions. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. It is the intention of the state of New Hampshire that the New Hampshire retirement system continue to provide medical benefits under RSA 100-A:52 subject to RSA 100-A:55, and that the employer make contributions in such amounts as the board of trustees shall deem necessary and appropriate under RSA 100-A:16 for such purpose.  Any forfeitures of a member's interest in the medical benefit accounts as provided under this section prior to any discontinuance of medical benefits by the legislature shall be applied to reduce any subsequent employer contributions made pursuant to this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The legislature may discontinue contributions under this subdivision with respect to medical benefits provided under RSA 100-A:52 or cease providing such medical benefits for any reason, at any time, in which event the funds allocated to provide such medical benefits, if any remain, shall be used to continue medical benefits to members who were eligible for them under RSA 100-A:52 and 100-A:55 prior to the discontinuance date as long as any funds remain.  However, if after the satisfaction of all medical benefits provided under RSA 100-A:52 there remain any funds, the program shall be deemed to be terminated and such remainder shall be returned to the appropriate employer, as defined in RSA 100-A:1, IV, in accordance with section 401(h)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The retirement system shall deduct from the monthly retirement allowance of retired state employees and/or each applicable spouse who are not Medicare eligible and receiving medical and surgical benefits provided pursuant to RSA 21-I:30, a premium contribution amount based on a percentage of the total monthly premium attributable to the applicable retiree and/or spouse, as determined by the commissioner of administrative services, with prior approval by the fiscal committee of the general court provided the percentage is not lower than 12.5 percent.  The department of administrative services shall provide information as to the total monthly premium cost for each participant to the retirement system for purposes of calculating this deduction.  Deducted amounts, which shall be in addition to and notwithstanding any amounts payable by the retirement system pursuant to RSA 100-A:52, RSA 100-A:52-a, and RSA 100-A:52-b, shall be deposited in the employee and retiree benefit risk management fund.  In the event the retiree's monthly allowance is insufficient to cover the certified contribution amount, the retirement system shall so notify the department of administrative services, which shall invoice and collect from the retiree and/or each applicable spouse the remaining contribution amount.  Failure to remit payment of the contribution amount in full within 30 days of billing shall be grounds for terminating benefits, effective from the beginning of the billing period.  Reenrollment shall be dependent upon payment of any outstanding contribution or other amounts within 6 months of the termination date.  The department of administrative services shall provide notice of the termination of benefits as provided in RSA 21-I:30, XIII.
