I. Group I Members.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any group I member may retire on a service retirement allowance upon written application to the board of trustees setting forth at what time, not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days subsequent to the filing thereof, the member desires to be retired, provided the member at the time so specified for retirement has attained age 60 and notwithstanding that during such period of notification the member may have separated from service.  For the purposes of this section, a teacher member of group I who remains in service throughout a school year shall be deemed to be in service during July and August at the end of such school year.  Provided, however, that a group I member who commenced service on or after July 1, 2011 shall not receive a service retirement allowance until attaining the age of 65;  but may receive a reduced allowance after age 60 if the member has at least 30 years of creditable service where the allowance shall be reduced, for each month by which the date on which benefits commence precedes the month after which the member attains 65 years of age, by  1/4 of one percent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon service retirement, an employee member or teacher member of group I shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall consist of a member annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions at the time of retirement, and a state annuity.  Prior to the member's attainment of age 65, the state annuity, together with the member annuity, shall be equal to  1/60 of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of creditable service.  After attainment of age 65, the state annuity, together with the member annuity, shall be equal to  1/66 of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of creditable service.  Provided, however, that a group I member who commenced service on or after July 1, 2011 shall not receive a service retirement allowance until attaining the age of 65;  but may receive a reduced allowance after age 60 if the member has at least 30 years of creditable service where the allowance shall be reduced, for each month by which the date on which benefits commence precedes the month after which the member attains 65 years of age, by  1/4 of one percent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any group I member who commenced service prior to July 1, 2011 who meets the requirements of RSA 100-A:10, I(a), and who has either completed at least 20 years of creditable service which, when combined with his or her age equals at least 70 years, or who has attained the age of 50, but not the age of 60, may elect to retire and have benefits commence immediately as a reduced service retirement allowance upon written application to the board of trustees setting forth the time, not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days subsequent to the filing thereof, at which the member desires to have benefits commence.  The service retirement allowance shall be determined in accordance with RSA 100-A:5, I(b) and shall be reduced, for each month by which the date on which benefits commence precedes the month after which the member attains 60 years of age, by  1/8 of one percent if the member has 35 years or more of creditable service, by  1/4 of one percent if the member has 30 years but less than 35 years of creditable service, by  1/3 of one percent if the member has at least 25 years but less than 30 years of creditable service, by  5/12 of one percent if the member has at least 20 years but less than 25 years of creditable service, and by  5/9 of one percent if the member has less than 20 years of creditable service.
