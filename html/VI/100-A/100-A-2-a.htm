Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 100-A:2, the board of trustees may cause any stock or other securities to be registered and held in the name of a nominee without mention of the retirement system's ownership, provided that no nominee shall have possession of or access to the stock or other securities unless the nominee shall be an officer of a corporate custodian of such stock or other securities, in which case the custodian shall maintain on its books accurate and current records of the New Hampshire retirement system's interest in such stock or other securities and the custodian shall be strictly liable for all acts or omissions of the nominee in connection with such stock or other securities and the nominee shall be bonded by the custodian.
