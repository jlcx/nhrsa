Notwithstanding the provision of RSA 100-A:4, III-b, for the purpose of calculating creditable service for eligibility for medical benefits payment under paragraph I, each full year of job-sharing service of a teacher in a job-sharing position shall be calculated at  1/2 of one year of such service credit.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the maximum amount payable by the retirement system under this subdivision on account of each person qualified under paragraph I who is not entitled to Medicare benefits, and on account of each person qualified under paragraph I who is entitled to Medicare benefits, shall be the same as the amount provided in RSA 100-A:52, II for group II retirees.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIV. In the case of group I members retired from employment by political subdivisions of the state, the amount payable by the retirement system on account of qualified persons shall be paid over to the employer, insurer, or health care administrator and used to pay for all or part of the medical benefits provided through the former employer for qualified persons.

As of July 1, 2001, in the case of group I members retired from state employment before July 1, 1991, and their beneficiaries who are eligible for coverage under this subdivision and also under the provisions of RSA 21-I:26-36, the amount payable by the retirement system on account of such persons shall be paid over to the state and used to pay for all or part of the medical benefits provided under RSA 21-I:26-36 for such persons, and the balance shall be paid by the state as provided in RSA 21-I:26-36.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVI. As of July 1, 2001, in the case of group I members retired from state employment on or after July 1, 1991, and their beneficiaries who are eligible for coverage under this subdivision and also under the provisions of RSA 21-I:26-36, the amount payable by the retirement system on account of such persons shall be paid over to the state and used to pay for all or part of the medical benefits provided under RSA 21-I:26-36 for such persons, and the state shall pay its portion as provided in RSA 21-I:26-36.  If the cost of the premium for any retired group I member and spouse, surviving spouse, or any other person entitled to benefits under paragraph I shall exceed the maximum under paragraph III, and the state does not elect to pay the excess cost above the amount to be paid under RSA 21-I:26-36, the excess cost shall be paid by the retiree or qualified surviving spouse and may be deducted from retirement benefits as provided in RSA 100-A:51.  The state may require, as a condition for coverage, that the retiree or surviving spouse apply for deduction of such excess cost from retirement benefits as provided in RSA 100-A:51.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVII. There shall be no age limit to participate in the employer sponsored medical and health plan provided in paragraph I, and there shall be no physical examination or health statement required for such coverage, provided, however, that if an eligible retired group I member of the retirement system fails to apply for such coverage within the time required by the insurance contract, the insurer may require satisfactory evidence of insurability as a condition for becoming insured.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIII. Any group I teacher member retired before January 1, 2000, or other eligible person under paragraph I, who would have been eligible for medical benefits under this section if this section had been in effect on the member's date of retirement, shall have the option of re-joining the medical or health plan sponsored by the retired member's former employer and of receiving benefits under this section, provided that such eligible person shall apply to the employer for such benefits before January 1, 2002.  Upon receipt of such application, the former employer shall enroll such retiree or other eligible person in the employer's plan in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as enrollment of a new employee but without any benefit-waiting period which may be applicable to new employees of that employer.  Neither an employer nor an employer's group plan or insurer shall be liable for any claims incurred prior to the date of enrollment under this paragraph.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIX. Any group I political subdivision employee member retired before January 1, 2001, or other eligible person under paragraph I, who would have been eligible for medical benefits under this section if this section had been in effect on the member's date of retirement, shall have the option of re-joining the medical or health plan sponsored by the retired member's former employer and of receiving benefits under this section, provided that such eligible person shall apply to the employer for such benefits before January 1, 2003.  Upon receipt of such application, the former employer shall enroll such retiree or other eligible person in the employer's plan in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as enrollment of a new employee but without any benefit-waiting period which may be applicable to new employees of that employer.  Neither an employer nor an employer's group plan or insurer shall be liable for any claims incurred prior to the date of enrollment under this paragraph.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX. The retirement system shall notify all group I teacher and political subdivision employee retirees and surviving spouse beneficiaries, who are currently drawing monthly allowances from the retirement system, of their possible right to re-join and active-employee medical insurance or health plan and to receive benefits under this section.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspXI. Any person who is eligible to receive group insurance or other medical benefits under the provisions of this section, but who does not need and who declines such benefits because they would be duplicative of coverage under any employer-sponsored plan, shall nevertheless continue to be eligible and, upon ceasing to be eligible for the other coverage, shall be permitted to receive the benefits allowable under this section without any waiting period.">
