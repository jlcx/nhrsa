&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 100-A:19-f Ordinary Disability Retirement. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding the creditable service requirements set forth in RSA 100-A:6, any member in service who has creditable service in both group I and group II with at least 10 years combined creditable service may be retired on an ordinary disability retirement allowance as provided in RSA 100-A:6, I(a) or II(a), subject to all applicable provisions of RSA 100-A:6.  If the member has attained the minimum age as set forth in RSA 100-A:19-b, the split-benefit ordinary disability retirement allowance shall be equivalent to a split-benefit service retirement allowance as provided in RSA 100-A:19-c;  otherwise, the allowance shall be determined as the sum of the ordinary disability retirement allowance with respect to service in each group classification computed as follows;  provided, however, that the total combined ordinary disability retirement allowance payable before the reduction provided in RSA 100-A:5, I(b) for the group I portion shall not be less than the minimum provided in RSA 100-A:6, I(b) or II(b) depending on the member's group classification at the time of retirement:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The average final compensation shall be as defined in RSA 100-A:1, XVIII, computed on the basis of the entire period of service in both classifications.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The group I portion of the ordinary disability retirement allowance shall be equal to 90 percent of the service retirement allowance as provided in RSA 100-A:5, I(b), based on the number of years of creditable service in group I.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The group II portion of the ordinary disability retirement allowance shall be equal to the service retirement allowance as provided in RSA 100-A:5, II(b), based on the number of years of creditable service in group II.
