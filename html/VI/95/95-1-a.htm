&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 95:1-a Public Officials Barred From Insurance Dealings. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
With respect to any public works or construction contracts of any type that are paid for by public funds of the state or by any of its political subdivisions, or of any public authority, it is unlawful for any officer or employee of the state, or of any of its political subdivisions, or of any public authority, either directly or indirectly to require the builder or the bidder to make application to or to get any surety bond or contract of insurance specified in the building or construction contract from a particular surety or insurance company, agent, or broker.  It is unlawful for any officer or employee of the state, of any of its political subdivisions, or of any public authority, or for any person who purports to act for such an officer or employee to negotiate, make application for, or to get any such a surety bond or contract of insurance which can be obtained by the builder, bidder, contractor, or subcontractor on the building or construction contract.  This section does not prevent any such an officer or employee of the state from exercising the state's right to approve the form, sufficiency, or manner of execution of the surety bonds or contracts of insurance furnished by the surety or insurance company selected by the bidder to underwrite surety bonds or insurance contracts.
