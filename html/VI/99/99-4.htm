&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 99:4 Salary Adjustment Fund. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Whereas the appropriations for personal services in state departments and institutions include an annual increment for each position, and whereas upon occasion due to vacancies and personnel turnover, salaries, increment increases and longevity as provided by the appropriations are not needed for said positions, each quarter the department of administrative services shall transfer said amount from the departmental or institutional appropriation to a special account to be known as the salary adjustment fund.  This fund shall lapse at the end of each fiscal year and revert to the appropriate fund.  Under no circumstances will this fund be used for temporary positions or new positions.  Upon the certification of the director of personnel, subject to the approval of governor and council, the salary adjustment fund shall be available for transfer to departments and institutions in amounts that are deemed necessary to comply with RSA 98.
