<codesect>
The deferred compensation plan shall operate without cost to any political subdivision, any of their departments or agencies, or any of their wholly owned institutions and instrumentalities, except for the incidental expense of administering the deduction of the deferred funds from the employee's compensation and the remittance thereof to the program as established by this chapter.  The deferred compensation commission may expend funds of the state not otherwise appropriated, with the approval of governor and council, for consulting or auditing services, which shall not exceed $10,000 per year.  The governor shall draw a warrant for such funds out of any sums in the general fund not otherwise appropriated.
