&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 99-F:4 Application Process. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. At each stage of the application process, a public employer shall grant a preference to an otherwise qualified veteran or disabled veteran who successfully completes an initial application screening and an application examination, or a state employment test administered by the public employer to establish eligibility for a vacant position for state employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For an application examination, administered after the initial application screening that results in a score, the public employer shall add 5 preference points to a veteran's and 10 preference points to a disabled veteran's total combined examination score without allocating the points to any single feature or part of the examination.  The veteran or disabled veteran shall pass the examination with a qualifying score to be eligible to receive the veterans' preference.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If a public employer uses an application examination that does not result in a score, the public employer shall devise and apply methods by which it gives special consideration in the hiring decision to veterans and disabled veterans.
