In such case the state shall also protect, indemnify, and hold harmless such person from any costs, damages, awards, judgments, or settlements arising from the claim or suit.  The attorney general or governor and council shall not be required to consider the request of such person that representation be provided for him or her unless within 7 days of the time such person is served with any summons, complaint, process, notice, demand, or pleading the person shall deliver the original or a copy thereof to the attorney general or, in the case of an action against the attorney general, to the governor and council.  As a condition to the continued representation by the attorney general and to the obligation of the state to indemnify and hold harmless, such officer, trustee, official, or employee shall cooperate with the attorney general in the defense of such claim or civil action.  No property either real or personal of the state of New Hampshire shall be subject to attachment or execution to secure payment of or to satisfy any obligations of the state created under this chapter.  Upon the entry of final judgment in any action brought under this chapter, the governor shall draw a warrant for said payment out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, and said sums are hereby appropriated.  The attorney general shall have the authority to settle any claim brought under this chapter by compromise and the amount of any such settlement shall be paid as if the amount were awarded as a judgment under this chapter.  Indemnification by the state under this section shall be for the actual amount of costs, damages, awards, judgments, or settlements personally incurred by any such officer, trustee, official, or employee, and the state shall not pay any amounts for which payment is the obligation of any insurance carrier or company under a policy or policies of insurance or any other third party under a similar obligation.
