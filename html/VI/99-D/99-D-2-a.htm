For the purposes of RSA 99-D:2, the term "official duty'' shall, in the case of a legislator, mean any duty or action taken in committee or in sessions of the general court or in such other forum where the legislator appears at the request of the house, senate or presiding officer of either body.  It shall also include any other act for which immunity is granted under the provisions of RSA 541-B:19.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to waive any immunity applicable to the legislator or the actions complained of, including those set forth in RSA 541-B:19, and all other provisions of RSA 99-D:2 shall apply.
