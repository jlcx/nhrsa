&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court shall cause notice of the claim and the substance thereof to be given to the defendant, whether or not the defendant is a resident of this state, by sending a written statement to the defendant by postpaid first class mail, addressed to the defendant at the defendant's last known post office address and directing the defendant to indicate, in writing within 30 days from the date said notice is mailed, the defendant's desire to be heard.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the defendant fails to respond to the notice and the notice is not returned as undelivered, a default judgment will be entered in favor of the plaintiff, who shall be notified by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the notice is returned as undelivered, then the court shall direct the plaintiff to complete service on the defendant, at the expense of the plaintiff, as in all other actions at law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the defendant responds to the notice indicating a desire to be heard, the case shall be scheduled for hearing shortly thereafter.  Both parties shall be notified by mail of the date and time of the hearing at least 14 days in advance of the hearing.
