&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The chief justice of the supreme court or, if the chief justice is unavailable, the most senior associate justice available, shall have the power, upon the request of the governor, attorney general, or the chief justice of the superior court or the administrative judge of the district or probate court or the judicial branch family division, or on his or her own motion, in the event of a declared state of emergency, as defined in RSA 4:45, to enter such order or orders as may be appropriate to suspend, toll, or otherwise grant relief for a period of up to 21 calendar days from time deadlines imposed by otherwise applicable statutes and rules of procedure regarding speedy trial procedures in criminal and juvenile court proceedings, all civil and equitable court process and court proceedings, and all appellate court time limitations.  Such order or orders may be renewed by a majority of the justices of the supreme court as justice may require;  provided, however, that any such renewal with respect to applicable statutes shall be effective only upon the concurrence of the governor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The general court may terminate any order entered pursuant to paragraph I of this section to the extent that it deals with applicable statutes by concurrent resolution adopted by a majority vote of each chamber.  The justices' authority to renew such an order to the extent that it deals with applicable statutes shall terminate upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution under this paragraph.
