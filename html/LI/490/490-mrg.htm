&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 490:3 Disqualification;  Temporary Justices. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The provisions as to the disqualification of justices of the superior court apply to justices of the supreme court.  Whenever a justice of the supreme court shall be disqualified or otherwise unable to sit in any cause or matter pending before such court, the chief or senior associate justice of the supreme court may assign another justice to sit according to the provisions of paragraph II of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon the retirement, disqualification, or inability to sit of any justice of the supreme court, the chief justice or senior associate justice of the supreme court may assign a justice of the supreme court who has retired from regular active service or, if a retired supreme court justice is unavailable, shall assign a justice of the superior court who has retired from regular active service to sit during supreme court sessions while the vacancy continues. The selection of a retired supreme or superior court justice shall be on a random basis.  However if no retired supreme or superior court justice is available, then the selection of a replacement justice shall be made on a random basis from a pool of full-time justices of the superior court.  In the event that no superior court justices are available, then the selection of a replacement justice shall be made on a random basis from a pool of full-time justices of the district and probate courts.  The clerk of the supreme court shall maintain a list of superior, probate, and district court judges who are willing to serve as temporary supreme court judges.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. If a vacancy occurs within 7 days of the scheduled oral argument of a case, the chief justice of the supreme court may assign to the case a temporary justice on a non-random basis if the assigned justice was assigned randomly to another case scheduled at the same monthly argument session or if the assigned justice is the chief justice of the superior court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-b. The chief justice of the supreme court may assign to a cause or matter as a temporary justice on a non-random basis a justice of the supreme court who sat in the cause or matter while it was pending before such court and who retired before the decision thereof.  This paragraph shall not apply to any subsequent hearing of the same cause or matter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A justice assigned to sit temporarily on the supreme court pursuant to paragraph II of this section shall have all the authority of a supreme court justice to hear arguments, render decisions, and file opinions.  No justice shall be assigned to sit on the supreme court in the determination of any cause or matter upon which the justice has previously sat or for which such justice is otherwise disqualified nor without such justice's consent.

I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all full-time nonjudicial employees of the judicial branch shall, effective January 1, 1984, be eligible for membership in the New Hampshire retirement system.  Employees who elect to become members of the New Hampshire retirement system shall not be eligible for membership in the local retirement system, except that nothing herein shall prevent an employee from returning a vested interest in a local retirement system.  The 6 month probationary period normally in effect shall be waived for all full-time nonjudicial employees who are employed by the court system on January 1, 1984.  All nonjudicial personnel hired after January 1, 1984, shall become members of the New Hampshire retirement system following the normally required probationary period.
<br>

II. Any such employee who is currently a member of a retirement system other than the New Hampshire retirement system may elect in writing to remain in the local retirement system by notifying the supreme court and the local governing body on or before December 1, 1983.  Employees so electing shall be considered employees of the local governing body for inclusion in the local retirement system only.  The state, after such election, shall pay into the local retirement system monthly all sums which would otherwise become payable by the local governing body into the local retirement system as its contributory share toward the retirement of said employee;  provided, however, that the contributory share shall not exceed the average percentage of the local governing body's annual contributions for all employees for the 3 years preceding January 1, 1984.  The state shall withhold from the salary of any such employee the employee's contributory share into the local retirement system and shall pay monthly the amount so withheld to the local governing body for deposit in the local retirement system on behalf of such employee.  Employees electing to continue as members of local retirement systems shall not be eligible for membership in the New Hampshire retirement system.

III. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all fulltime nonjudicial employees who elect to become members of the New Hampshire retirement system may purchase prior service credits for those years during which they were employed as full-time court employees.  Prior service credit in the New Hampshire retirement system equal to the membership service in a local retirement system may be purchased upon certification that the member is not eligible for benefits from the local retirement system.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The chief justice and a majority of the supreme court, in consultation with the administrative judges of the superior and circuit courts and other nonjudicial branch officers as established by court rule, shall design and implement by court rule, a program for performance evaluation of judges.  The sole purpose of this program shall be the improvement of the performance of individual judges and of the judiciary as a whole.

II. The program for performance evaluation shall be as inclusive as practicable and shall include, but shall not be limited to, a questionnaire, to be designed by the supreme court, and a self-evaluation form to be completed by the judge.  The supreme court shall strive to achieve uniformity among court evaluation questionnaires, recognizing that the questionnaires for each court may differ due to the jurisdiction of the courts.  Questionnaires shall be available to attorneys, parties, witnesses, jurors, court personnel, and others who have appeared before a judge during the evaluation period, for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the judge.  The questionnaire shall include, but shall not be limited to, questions relative to the judge's performance, temperament and demeanor, judicial management skills, legal knowledge, attentiveness, bias and objectivity, and degree of preparedness.  Completed forms shall be returned to the administrative judge, unsigned, within 30 days of issuance.  All responses shall remain confidential.
<br>
