&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. There is established a statewide drug offender grant program which shall provide state matching funds as appropriated to support drug courts or alternative drug offender programs in state superior court districts.  The grant program shall be available to counties operating either a drug court or an alternative drug offender program prior to the effective date of this section, and to counties that have not yet implemented a drug court or an alternative drug offender program.  A county shall be eligible for a drug court or an alternative drug offender grant, but not both.  Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the statewide drug offender grant program shall continue as long as it is funded through appropriations in the state operating budget.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. There is established the office of drug offender program coordinator within the administrative office of the superior court.  The office shall be responsible for developing an application process by which counties may apply for a state grant and evaluating the operating drug courts and alternative drug offender programs.  Subject to approval of the chief justice of the superior court, the office shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Determine approval requirements including the New Hampshire drug court and alternative drug offender program approval checklists.  Prior to accepting applications for grants, the approval checklists shall be posted on the judicial branch website.  The checklists shall be updated on the website as revisions are made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Establish and periodically update best practices for operating drug courts and alternative drug offender programs.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Develop draft policies and procedures including a participant handbook, program outline, and implementation plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Measure recidivism rates and other outcome measures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Evaluate compliance with relevant standards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Assist in creating drug courts or alternative drug offender programs in counties seeking to implement or continue either of them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Assist counties in obtaining ongoing training.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A county operating a drug court or alternative drug offender program which is not funded by the judicial branch pursuant to RSA 592-B:9, or which seeks to establish such a program, may be eligible for a state grant which shall pay 50 percent of the cost up to the amounts indicated in RSA 490-G:5, I from funds administered by the administrative office of the superior court.  The remaining cost shall be funded by the county.
