&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 490-D:1 Judicial Branch Family Division Established. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The general court hereby organizes, constitutes, and establishes the judicial branch family division.  The goals of the family division are the respectful treatment of all citizens by justices, marital masters, and other family division staff, the prompt and fair resolution of family issues by justices and marital masters specially selected and trained to deal effectively with such issues, the use of alternative dispute resolution to reduce the adversarial nature of proceedings involving families, and the assignment of all family matters of a single family to one family division justice or marital master located in a family division court that is geographically accessible to the family.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 490-D:3 Equity Jurisdiction. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the judicial branch family division shall have the powers of a court of equity in cases where subject matter jurisdiction lies with the judicial branch family division.

Such suits may be heard by any justice of the judicial branch family division at any time, but nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting the power of the judicial branch family division to have issues of fact framed and tried by a jury, according to the rules in equity, or the course of such proceedings at common law.
