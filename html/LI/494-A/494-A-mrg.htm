<center><h3>Section 494-A:11</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 494-A:11 Procedures for Complaints;  Public Availability. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
The commission shall adopt rules of procedure to be followed in making its determinations which shall incorporate the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. When a complaint is received by the commission, the commission shall determine if the complaint alleges a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.  If the commission determines that the complaint on its face alleges no violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, the commission shall dismiss the complaint and respond to the complaining party, explaining the basis for its decision.  If the commission determines that the complaint alleges a violation, the commission shall send a copy of the complaint to the judge or clerk and the judge or clerk shall have 21 days to respond in writing.  There shall be no direct communications between the judge or clerk and the complaining party.  Following the response from the judge or clerk, the commission shall send a copy of the response to the complaining party.  The commission may also conduct such further investigation as it may deem necessary before ruling on the complaint.  The commission shall, within 90 days of the first meeting following receipt of the complaint, or for good cause shown, such longer period as determined by the commission, determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the judge or clerk has committed a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.  If not, the complaint shall be dismissed.  If so, the commission shall proceed to make a final determination as to whether a violation has occurred.  In any event, the complaining party and the judge or clerk shall be informed of the ruling on probable cause along with a brief explanation of the basis of the decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. After making a finding of probable cause, the commission shall conduct a public hearing before making a final determination.  After probable cause has been found, the complaint, response, transcripts, findings, deliberations, and reports of actions taken shall be available to the public under the provisions of RSA 91-A.  The exemption regarding internal personnel practices in RSA 91-A:5, IV shall be inapplicable to proceedings or documents under this paragraph relating to a complaint before the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. After notice and hearing, the commission may impose disciplinary actions with regard to a complaint by reprimand or censure.  The commission may recommend that the supreme court suspend the judge or clerk.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the complaint referred to the commission alleges conduct that would constitute a crime, the commission chairperson shall immediately refer the matter to the attorney general.  The referral of such a complaint to the attorney general shall not supersede the commission's jurisdiction relative to whether a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct has occurred.  However, the commission shall suspend its activities until the criminal proceedings, if any, are concluded.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In all cases, whether a complaint is dismissed or not, complaints received by the commission shall be made available to the administrative judge of the court in which the judge or clerk complained against holds office.  Furthermore, all complaints against judges and clerks received by the administrative judges and other judges of the superior court, the district court, and the probate court shall be forwarded to the commission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The statute of limitations for any complaint shall be 3 years from the act which is the subject of the complaint or from the conclusion of the trial or appeal during which the act occurred, whichever is later.

No member, staff, or agent of the judicial conduct commission shall disclose such information except in the course of official duty.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In a hearing under RSA 494-A:11, II if any part of the complaint involves the conduct of a person in a case required to be confidential by law, the commission may, by majority vote, conduct the hearing, or any part thereof, in a session not open to the public.  In such circumstances the commission shall make available to the public a summary of the nature of the complaint, the names of the person complained against and the complainant, and the decision of the committee.
