I. When ordered to do so by the court, the clerk shall draw at random from the master jury list the names or identifying numbers of as many prospective jurors as the court by order requires.  The names or identifying numbers of prospective jurors may be chosen either by random drawing or by computer on a random basis.  The clerk shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names drawn.  The names drawn on the list may be disclosed only to persons authorized to see the list under this chapter or upon specific order of the court.  The addresses of jurors shall not be disclosed, except to counsel, a pro se party examining juror qualification forms, or otherwise in accordance with court rule.

(2) Able to read, speak and understand the English language;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Notarization of the juror qualification form shall not be required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If it appears there is an omission, ambiguity, or error in a return form, the clerk shall again send the form with instructions to the prospective juror to make the necessary addition, clarification, or correction and return the form to the clerk within 10 days after receipt of these instructions.
