&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In addition to the provisions of RSA 500-A:12, the following provisions shall be incorporated into jury selection for civil cases:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court shall instruct the panel of prospective jurors prior to jury selection as to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The nature and purpose of the selection process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The nature of the case to be presented.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The specific issues for resolution.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A summary of the law to be used in their consideration of the evidence.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any controversial aspects of the trial likely to invoke bias.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Counsel for each party shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to address the panel of prospective jurors for the purpose of explaining such party's claims, defenses, and concerns in sufficient detail to prompt jury reflection, probing, and subsequent disclosure of information, opinion, bias, or prejudices which might prevent a juror from attaining the requisite degree of neutrality required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The trial judge shall examine the prospective jurors.  Upon completion of the judge's initial examination, counsel for each party shall have the right to examine, by oral and direct questioning, any of the prospective jurors in order to enable counsel to intelligently exercise both peremptory challenges and challenges for cause.  During any examination conducted by counsel for the parties, the trial judge shall permit liberal and probing examination calculated to discover bias or prejudice with regard to the circumstances of the particular case.  The fact that a topic has been included in the judge's examination shall not preclude additional non-repetitive or non-duplicative questioning in the same area by counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The scope of the examination conducted by counsel shall be within reasonable limits prescribed by the trial judge's sound discretion.  In exercising his or her sound discretion as to the form and subject matter of voir dire questions, the trial judge shall consider, among other criteria, any unique or complex elements, legal or factual, in the case and the individual responses or conduct of jurors which may evince attitudes inconsistent with suitability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in the particular case.  Specific unreasonable or arbitrary time limits shall not be imposed.  The trial judge shall permit counsel to conduct voir dire examination without requiring prior submission of the questions unless a particular counsel engages in improper questioning.  For purposes of this section, an "improper question'' is any question which, as its dominant purpose, attempts to precondition the prospective jurors to a particular result, indoctrinate the jury, or question the prospective jurors concerning the pleadings or the applicable law.  A court shall not arbitrarily or unreasonably refuse to submit reasonable written questions, the contents of which are determined by the court in its sound discretion, when requested by counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Upon the agreement of all parties, the trial judge may waive voir dire examination by counsel under this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In the trial in the superior court of any civil or criminal case, when it appears to the presiding justice that there is reason for the selection of alternate jurors, the jurors shall, at the direction of the presiding justice, be drawn, selected and empaneled in the same manner as the regular jurors.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The alternate jurors shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Be sworn with and seated near the jury with equal opportunity for seeing and hearing the proceedings;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Attend the trial at all times with the jury;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Obey all orders and admonitions of the court to the jury;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Be kept with the jury if the court orders the jury to be kept together.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The alternate jurors shall be liable as regular jurors for failure to attend the trial or to obey any order or admonition of the court to the jury.  They shall receive the same compensation as other jurors.  At the final submission of the case to the jury, any remaining alternate jurors who have not been substituted under paragraph IV, may be excused by the court or, if required to remain at court, shall be kept separate and apart from the other jurors in an appropriate place, subject to the same rules and orders as the jurors, until the jury has agreed upon a verdict or has been otherwise discharged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If, before the final submission of the case to the jury, one or more jurors becomes incapacitated, is disqualified or dies, his place shall be taken, upon the order of the court, by an alternate juror who shall become one of the jury and serve in all respects as if selected as an original juror.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If, at any time after the final submission of the case to the jury, and before the jury has agreed on a verdict, a juror becomes incapacitated, is disqualified, or dies, the presiding justice may order him or her to be discharged and direct the clerk to select at random the name of an alternate, who shall then take the place of the discharged juror on the jury.  Before making a substitution, the presiding justice shall make a finding on record that the substitution will not cause prejudice to any party.  The presiding justice shall instruct the jury to recommence deliberations and shall give the jury such other supplemental instructions as may be appropriate.  The jury shall then renew its deliberations with the alternate juror.
