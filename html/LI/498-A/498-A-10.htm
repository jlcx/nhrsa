&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 498-A:10 Right to Enter Property Prior to Condemnation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Prior to the time of filing the declaration of taking, the condemnor or its employees or agents shall have the right to enter upon any land or improvement which it has the power to condemn, in order to make studies, surveys, tests, soundings, and appraisals;  provided, however, that the condemnee has been notified 10 days prior to entry on the property.  Such entry and related activities shall not constitute a trespass, but the condemnor shall be liable for any actual damages caused thereby.  This liability may be enforced in a civil action against the condemnor brought in the superior court in the county in which the property is located, with damages to be assessed by the board in the manner provided in RSA 498-A:24.
