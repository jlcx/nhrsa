<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no person's private real property shall be taken pursuant to this chapter unless that real property is to be put to public use, as defined in RSA 498-A:2, VII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 498-A:4 Preliminary Steps to Initiating Action. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Disclosure.  At the initial contact with a property owner, the condemnor shall provide to the condemnee information regarding acquisition and relocation.  Such information shall include a disclosure, conspicuously located, which states that the condemnor does not represent the rights of the condemnee and that the condemnee may want to obtain independent advice or unbiased counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Appraisal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The condemnor shall have an impartial, qualified appraiser make at least one appraisal of all property proposed to be acquired.  The appraiser shall make reasonable efforts to confer with the condemnees or their personal representatives.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Condemnees who are the subject of a property acquisition shall have a reasonable opportunity to have their property appraised by an independent, qualified appraiser, employed by the condemnees.  The condemnor shall reimburse the usual and customary cost of the appraisal up to $1,000 for each property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Before making the offer provided for in paragraph III, the condemnor shall make reasonable efforts to negotiate with the condemnees or their personal representatives for the purchase of the property, but failure to confer or negotiate shall not be a defense to condemnation of a property.  Any sum of money or other consideration discussed by either the condemnor or the condemnee during any such negotiations shall not be admissible in evidence and shall not be referred to in any proceedings for the determination of just compensation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Within 10 days of receipt of a notice of offer provided for in paragraph III of this section a municipal condemnee shall, at the request of the condemnor, furnish the condemnor with the estimated amount of unpaid taxes, fees and interest for which notice has not been recorded at the registry of deeds for the county in which the property is located.  Failure to timely provide such estimate shall not affect any right of a municipal condemnee under this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The condemnor shall review any independent appraisals prepared under this paragraph for accuracy before formulating a notice of offer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The condemnor shall provide a copy of the appraisal, and if requested, any official appraisal review notes upon which the negotiations are based, to the condemnee at the time of negotiation or at least 45 days prior to making the notice of offer, whichever comes first.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notice of Offer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The condemnor shall make its notice of offer within a reasonable time after the governmental entity, with the statutory authority to condemn, votes to acquire a property.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) No property shall be taken unless the condemnor shall serve upon the condemnee a written notice of offer to purchase, which shall set forth:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The purpose for which the property will be taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A description of the property to be taken sufficient for the identification thereof, including sources of title, if ascertainable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The amount of compensation offered and whether the offer is based on the appraisal required by RSA 498-A:4, II(a), or on some other basis.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The effective date of the appraisal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) That an action to condemn the property in the manner provided by this chapter will be commenced if the offer is not accepted within 30 days after service of the notice.  Just compensation for the taking shall be based on the value of the property as of the date of taking or at the sole election of all condemnees, compensation may be based upon the property's value based upon the date the governmental entity, with the statutory authority to condemn, votes to acquire the comdemnee's property.  Any such election shall occur not later than 30 days from the return date of the RSA 498-A:8, I order of notice by written notice to the board of tax and land appeals and the condemnor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The offer shall remain outstanding and may be accepted by the condemnee until such time as either the condemnor or the condemnee files a petition in the superior court to have the damages reassessed under RSA 498-A:27.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The condemnor shall make public a complete list of such offers showing the name of each condemnee and the amount of the offer in each case, including the value of the property before and after the taking, if different, and the amount of damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Service of Notice.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The giving of the notice of offer is a jurisdictional prerequisite to instituting condemnation proceedings.  The notice may be served by certified mail and service shall be complete on the date of mailing.  If the condemnee is a minor, an incompetent person, unknown, or is one whose whereabouts are unknown, the condemnor shall serve such notice upon the legal guardian of the condemnee.  If there is no such guardian, the condemnor shall petition the board and request that a guardian ad litem be appointed to represent such condemnee.  If the condemnee is unknown or one whose whereabouts are unknown, such notice shall also be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the property is located.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the offer is accepted, the transfer of title shall be accomplished within 30 days after acceptance, including payment of the considerations set forth in the offer or as agreed upon between the parties, unless such time is extended by mutual written consent by the condemnor and condemnee.  In the event the condemnee fails to convey the property within the specified time, the condemnor may commence condemnation proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the offer is not accepted within 30 days after the service of the notice, the condemnor shall commence condemnation proceedings within 90 days after the expiration of such 30-day period.

After the giving of any bond and security as may be required under RSA 498-A:6, the title which the condemnor seeks in the property condemned shall pass to the condemnor on the date of such filing, and the condemnor shall be entitled to possession as provided in RSA 498-A:11.  A declaration may include more than one parcel and multiple condemnees so long as the identity of the property taken of each condemnee and the nature of their interests are readily ascertainable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The declaration of taking shall be in writing and executed by the condemnor, shall be captioned as a proceeding in rem and shall contain the following:

<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) A brief description of the purpose of the condemnation, the need therefor, and the public use to which the real property will be put;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) A statement of the nature of the property being taken.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The declaration of taking may be amended by order of the board, upon agreement of the parties, or upon appropriate motion filed by the condemnor.  Such amendments shall be permitted for the purpose of correcting errors and omissions which may exist in the declaration of taking, but shall not be permitted for the purpose of increasing or decreasing the physical extent of the taking or the nature of the property taken.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Within 30 days after the return day, any condemnee may file a motion in the office of the board raising preliminary objections to the declaration of taking.  The board upon cause shown may extend the time for filing preliminary objection.  Preliminary objection shall be limited to and shall be the exclusive method of challenging:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The sufficiency of the security;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any other procedure followed by the condemnor;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The necessity, public use, and net-public benefit of the taking.

II. Failure to raise any matters by preliminary objection shall constitute a waiver thereof.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If a condemnee files a preliminary objection under RSA 498-A:9-a, I(c) concerning necessity, public use, or net-public benefit, the board shall transfer that preliminary objection to the superior court of the county in which the property is located.  There shall be no filing fee for such transfer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon receipt of the transfer from the board, the superior court shall require a response from the condemnor and may conduct an evidentiary hearing before it rules on the preliminary objection.  Parties may appeal the superior court's decision to the supreme court.  Once the decision is final and nonappealable, the superior court shall send to the board a copy of its decision.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If the superior court denies the condemnee's preliminary objection, the board shall then proceed under RSA 498-A:25 to determine the amount of just compensation.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 498-A:10 Right to Enter Property Prior to Condemnation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Prior to the time of filing the declaration of taking, the condemnor or its employees or agents shall have the right to enter upon any land or improvement which it has the power to condemn, in order to make studies, surveys, tests, soundings, and appraisals;  provided, however, that the condemnee has been notified 10 days prior to entry on the property.  Such entry and related activities shall not constitute a trespass, but the condemnor shall be liable for any actual damages caused thereby.  This liability may be enforced in a civil action against the condemnor brought in the superior court in the county in which the property is located, with damages to be assessed by the board in the manner provided in RSA 498-A:24.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The condemnor, after the filing of the declaration of taking, shall be entitled to possession or right of entry upon deposit with the board of the amount of just compensation as estimated by the condemnor, and interest shall not accrue thereafter on such sum, but shall only accrue on the amount of final award or judgment in excess thereof.  The clerk of the board shall pay over the sum deposited upon demand to the condemnee.  Whenever the board is satisfied that any person, whether holding under the owner or not, is preventing or obstructing the condemnor from entering upon or taking possession of the property after the condemnor is entitled to do so, it may grant such rights as it may think necessary or may proceed for contempt.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If within 60 days from the filing of the declaration of taking the condemnor has not deposited just compensation as provided in paragraph I, the board, upon petition of the condemnee, may compel the condemnor to file a declaration of estimated just compensation or, if the condemnor fails or refuses to file such declaration, may, at the cost of the condemnor, appoint an impartial expert appraiser to estimate such just compensation.  The board may, after hearing, order the deposit of the amount of the estimated just compensation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A condemnee who withdraws the sum deposited under either paragraph I or paragraph II shall be deemed to have waived all objections and defenses to the action and to the taking of his property except for any claim to greater compensation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any amount deposited or withdrawn under this section is not admissible in evidence and shall not be referred to in any proceeding for the determination of just compensation.

I. If a condemnor has condemned a fee and thereafter abandons the purpose for which the property has been condemned, the condemnor may dispose of it by sale or otherwise;  provided, however, that if the property has not been substantially improved, it may not be disposed of within 10 years of condemnation without first being offered to the condemnee, his heirs and assigns at the same price paid to the condemnee by the condemnor.  The condemnee, his heirs and assigns shall be served with notice of the offer in the same manner as prescribed for the service of notices in RSA 498-A:4, and shall have 90 days after receipt of such notice to make the written acceptance thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a condemnor has acquired a fee and thereafter abandons the property, after the purpose is served for which the property was acquired, or abandons the property for any reason within 10 years of acquisition, the property may not be disposed of without first being offered to the landowner, his heirs and assigns at a price equal to the current appraised value of the property including any improvements made thereon.  The landowner, his heirs and assigns shall be served notice pursuant to RSA 498-A:12, I.
