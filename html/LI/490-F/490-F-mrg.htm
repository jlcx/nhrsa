IV. The supreme court, after reviewing population, caseload, judicial time, and efficiency, available judicial resources, the needs of the circuit court, and other relevant criteria may request the governor and council to designate a sitting part-time judge as a full-time judge.  The court may recommend certain judges;  however, the governor and council shall not be bound by that recommendation.  Upon designation, that judge shall become full-time.  Prior to making its request, the supreme court shall receive the approval of the fiscal committee of the general court and there shall be funds in the court's budget specifically appropriated for the salary and benefits of an additional full-time circuit court judge.

For the purpose of calculating the biennial budget request and judicial salaries as well as the number of judicial positions required in the circuit court, the supreme court shall establish and revise as needed a weighted case value, relating the judicial time required for each type of case included in the court's jurisdiction, which when multiplied by the caseload of each court will produce the number of weighted case units for that court.
