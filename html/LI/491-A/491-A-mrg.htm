<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. For purposes of calculating the annual salaries of part-time district court justices appointed after July 1, 1987, the supreme court shall establish and revise as needed a weighted case value, relating the judicial time required for each type of case included in the court's jurisdiction, which when multiplied by the caseload of each court will produce the number of weighted case units for that court.  Any revisions to the weighted case values shall be approved by the legislature.  The number of weighted case units shall be calculated by the administrative office of the courts in July of each year, using caseload statistics for the preceding 12-month period.  Said weighted case units shall serve as the basis for determining the salary of part-time justices for the next calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The following compensation schedule shall be used when calculating salaries for part-time district court justices, beginning July 1, 1987:

III. The salary of a part-time justice shall not exceed 70 percent of the taxable salary of a full-time district court justice as provided by RSA 491-A:1.  Judicial time shall be measured in weighted case units which shall reflect judicial time required to process a case.  The compensation per weighted case unit shall be proportional to the taxable compensation for a full-time judge.  A part-time justice, whose weighted caseload equals 3.5 judicial days per week, shall receive the maximum salary as provided by this section.  The compensation schedule provided by this section shall be based upon the taxable salary of a full-time district court justice pursuant to RSA 491-A:1.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The supreme court, after reviewing population, caseload, judicial time and efficiency, available judicial resources, the needs of the judicial branch family division, and other relevant criteria may request the governor and council to designate a sitting part-time justice as a full-time justice.  The court may recommend certain justices;  however, the governor and council shall not be bound by that recommendation.  Upon designation, that justice shall become full-time.  Prior to making its request, there shall be funds in the court's budget specifically appropriated for the salary and benefits of an additional full-time district court justice.
