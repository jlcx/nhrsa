<center><h3>Section 491:8-a</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 491:8-a Motions for Summary Judgment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A party seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim, or to obtain a declaratory judgment, may, at any time after the defendant has appeared, move for summary judgment in his favor upon all or any part thereof.  A party against whom a claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought, may, at any time, move for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any party seeking summary judgment shall accompany his motion with an affidavit based upon personal knowledge of admissible facts as to which it appears affirmatively that the affiants will be competent to testify.  The facts stated in the accompanying affidavits shall be taken to be admitted for the purpose of the motion, unless within 30 days contradictory affidavits based on personal knowledge are filed or the opposing party files an affidavit showing specifically and clearly reasonable grounds for believing that contradictory evidence can be presented at a trial but cannot be furnished by affidavits.  Copies of all motions and affidavits shall, upon filing, be furnished to opposing counsel or to the opposing party, if the opposing party is not represented by counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits filed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone, although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If affidavits are not filed by the party opposing the summary judgment within 30 days, judgment shall be entered on the next judgment day in accordance with the facts.  When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this section, the adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavits or by reference to depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If it appears to the court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this section are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order the party presenting them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused him to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees.  Any offending party or attorney may be found guilty of contempt.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 491:22 Declaratory Judgments. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Any person claiming a present legal or equitable right or title may maintain a petition against any person claiming adversely to such right or title to determine the question as between the parties, and the court's judgment or decree thereon shall be conclusive.  The taxpayers of a taxing district in this state shall be deemed to have an equitable right and interest in the preservation of an orderly and lawful government within such district;  therefore any taxpayer in the jurisdiction of the taxing district shall have standing to petition for relief under this section when it is alleged that the taxing district or any agency or authority thereof has engaged, or proposes to engage, in conduct that is unlawful or unauthorized, and in such a case the taxpayer shall not have to demonstrate that his or her personal rights were impaired or prejudiced.  The preceding sentence shall not be deemed to convey standing to any person (a) to challenge a decision of any state court if the person was not a party to the action in which the decision was rendered, or (b) to challenge the decision of any board, commission, agency, or other authority of the state or any municipality, school district, village district, or county if there exists a right to appeal the decision under RSA 541 or any other statute and the person seeking to challenge the decision is not entitled to appeal under the applicable statute.  The existence of an adequate remedy at law or in equity shall not preclude any person from obtaining such declaratory relief.  However, the provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the burden of proof under RSA 491:22-a or permit awards of costs and attorney's fees under RSA 491:22-b in declaratory judgment actions that are not for the purpose of determining insurance coverage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The district court shall have concurrent jurisdiction over such claims arising under its subject matter jurisdiction authority in RSA 502-A except that the defendant shall have the right to remove said declaratory judgment action to the superior court, subject to conditions established by rule of court, if the claim exceeds $1,500.  The court of probate shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such claims arising under its subject matter jurisdiction authority in RSA 547 and RSA 552:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. No petition shall be maintained under this section to determine coverage of an insurance policy unless it is filed within 6 months after the filing of the writ, complaint, or other pleading initiating the action which gives rise to the question;  provided, however, that the foregoing prohibition shall not apply where the facts giving rise to such coverage dispute are not known to, or reasonably discoverable by, the insurer until after expiration of such 6-month period;  and provided, further, that the superior court may permit the filing of such a petition after such period upon a finding that the failure to file such petition was the result of accident, mistake or misfortune and not due to neglect.  A petition for declaratory judgment to determine coverage of an insurance policy may be instituted as long as the court has personal jurisdiction over the parties to the matter, even though the action giving rise to the coverage question is brought in a federal court or another state court.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 491:24 Civil Suits Against Municipal Officials. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever a municipal official or individual member of a municipal board or agency, who is subject to good faith immunity under the provisions of RSA 31:104 or the common law of New Hampshire, is sued personally for money damages and the plaintiff alleges injury or damage resulting from action taken in bad faith or with malice on the part of the official or member when acting in his or her official capacity, the superior court shall hold a preliminary hearing within 90 days of the service date specified by the court on the summons.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. At the hearing the plaintiff shall demonstrate that the allegation of bad faith or malice is based upon information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry and well grounded in fact and that there is a substantial likelihood that, following discovery, evidence shall be adduced sufficient to create an issue for determination by the finder of fact.  If the plaintiff fails in such demonstration, the action against such official or member shall be dismissed.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If, upon all the evidence presented at the hearing, the court determines that the action is frivolous or intended to harass or to influence the official actions or decisions of the municipal official or board member, the plaintiff shall pay the court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees of the defendant.
