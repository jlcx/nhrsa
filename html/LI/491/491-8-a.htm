&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 491:8-a Motions for Summary Judgment. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A party seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim, or to obtain a declaratory judgment, may, at any time after the defendant has appeared, move for summary judgment in his favor upon all or any part thereof.  A party against whom a claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought, may, at any time, move for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any party seeking summary judgment shall accompany his motion with an affidavit based upon personal knowledge of admissible facts as to which it appears affirmatively that the affiants will be competent to testify.  The facts stated in the accompanying affidavits shall be taken to be admitted for the purpose of the motion, unless within 30 days contradictory affidavits based on personal knowledge are filed or the opposing party files an affidavit showing specifically and clearly reasonable grounds for believing that contradictory evidence can be presented at a trial but cannot be furnished by affidavits.  Copies of all motions and affidavits shall, upon filing, be furnished to opposing counsel or to the opposing party, if the opposing party is not represented by counsel.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits filed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone, although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If affidavits are not filed by the party opposing the summary judgment within 30 days, judgment shall be entered on the next judgment day in accordance with the facts.  When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this section, the adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavits or by reference to depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. If it appears to the court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this section are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order the party presenting them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused him to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees.  Any offending party or attorney may be found guilty of contempt.
