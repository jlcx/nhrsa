<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding paragraph I, and notwithstanding the provisions of any other law relative to confidentiality, including but not limited to confidentiality provisions applicable to any case out of which an allegation or complaint against a guardian ad litem may arise:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Persons involved in matters before the board, or persons seeking to address or respond to issues involving a guardian ad litem's misconduct or certification, may, without a specific court order allowing such disclosure, disclose to the board, its representatives, or its agents, records, documents, or information in their possession, whether oral or in writing, relating to a guardian ad litem, an applicant for certification as a guardian ad litem, or cases in which a guardian ad litem is or has been involved, unless such disclosure is prohibited by court order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the board concludes that to do so would advance the effective and fair resolution of the matter, the board, its representatives, or its agents may, without a specific court order allowing such disclosure, disclose to persons involved in matters before the board, or to persons seeking to address or respond to issues involving a guardian ad litem's misconduct or certification, any records, documents, or information in its possession, whether oral or in writing, that have a bearing upon the matter, unless such disclosure is prohibited by court order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Persons involved in matters before the board, or persons seeking to address or respond to issues involving a guardian ad litem's misconduct or certification, may, without a specific court order allowing such disclosure, disclose to other persons involved in the matter documents or information in their possession, whether oral or in writing, to the extent, and only to the extent, that such disclosure is necessary in order to comply with the procedures of the board, unless such disclosure is prohibited by a court order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The board, its representatives, or its agents may, without a specific court order, disclose to any court that appoints or oversees guardians ad litem, or any other entity or group which possesses oversight authority over any type of professional activity of persons who may serve as a guardian ad litem, any records, documents, or information in the possession of the board, whether oral or in writing, including but not limited to that information described in RSA 490-C:4, II(b), unless such disclosure is prohibited by court order.  In assessing whether or not to make a disclosure or engage in a communication under this subparagraph, consideration shall be given to whether or not it is likely that information conveyed will be further disseminated in a manner contrary to New Hampshire law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In the case of disclosures made in accordance with paragraph II, any statutory provisions prescribing penalties for the disclosure of confidential information, including but not limited to laws relative to the penalties for the disclosure of information in cases or proceedings in which a guardian ad litem may be involved, shall not apply to the disclosure to the extent that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) It is made to the board or its representatives or agents under subparagraph II(a), or to other persons in accordance with subparagraph II(c), in good faith;  or

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Hearings and other proceedings held by the board shall be open to the public unless closed, in whole or in part, by the board.  The board shall close a hearing, proceeding, or matter, in whole or in part, if it concludes, in its discretion, that to open the hearing, proceeding, or matter, or a certain portion thereof, would be likely to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Result in the board publicly hearing, or in the public dissemination of, information that arose in a court proceeding that was not open to the public;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Result in the public dissemination of information in a manner prohibited by court order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Be contrary to the best interests of a recipient of guardian ad litem services;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Cause unreasonable harm to one or more persons involved in any court proceeding or any proceeding or other matter before the board, including but not limited to the guardian ad litem;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Be detrimental to the effective resolution of a matter pending before the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. In applying the provisions of paragraph IV, the board shall, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, seek to open or close hearings, proceedings, or other matters in a manner that is consistent with any confidentiality laws, court rules, or known orders pertaining to the case out of which a complaint against a presently or formerly certified guardian ad litem or other matter, arose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. (a) As an alternative to, or in conjunction with, the complete closure of a hearing, proceeding, or other matter, or of a part thereof, the board may, in its discretion, make such limitations, prohibitions, or instructions relative to the hearing, proceeding, or matter as it concludes are necessary to avoid:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The likely public dissemination of information that arose in a court proceeding that was not open to the public;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The likely public dissemination of information in a manner prohibited by court order;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Probable detriment to the best interests of a recipient of services;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Unreasonable harm to one or more persons involved in any court proceeding or any proceeding or other matter before the board, including but not limited to the guardian ad litem;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Probable detriment to the effective resolution of a matter pending before the board.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Limitations, prohibitions, or instructions under subparagraph (a) may include, but need not be limited to, limitations or prohibitions on, or other instructions regarding, any one or more of the following:  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The audiotaping, videotaping, or other recording of a hearing, proceeding, or matter by a person or persons present;  
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The photographing of a hearing, proceeding, or matter before the board;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(1) Such limitations, prohibitions, or instructions may, at the request of an interested person or on the board's own action, be reviewed by and affirmed, modified, or reversed by the board;

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Such limitations, prohibitions, or instructions shall not include the authority to make limitations or prohibitions on the disclosure or use of material in circumstances outside of a hearing or proceeding, the authority for which shall, in the first instance, be with the board according to the standards set forth in paragraph VII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) The board may limit or prohibit the disclosure or use outside of a hearing, proceeding, or other matter before the board, or in other circumstances, of some or all of the evidence, testimony, documents, or other materials relating to the hearing, proceeding, or matter, or parts thereof, including but not limited to guardian ad litem reports, medical records, and school records.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The board concludes that such limitation is necessary to prevent the potential disclosure of confidential material beyond those disclosures that are allowed by law, by court order, or by the board's limitations, prohibitions, or instructions under this chapter;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
