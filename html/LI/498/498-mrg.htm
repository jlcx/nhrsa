<codesect>
In all cases where by reason of a change of circumstances which has occurred, shall occur, or is reasonably foreseeable, subsequent to the creation, heretofore or hereafter, of a trust by any deed, will or other instrument, compliance by the trustee or trustees with the terms of the trust relating to the property or the kinds or classes of property which may be held under the trust would defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust, the court may, upon the filing by the trustee of a bill in equity for instructions and upon notice to all parties in interest, enter a decree permitting the trustee to deviate from such terms of the trust and directing the trustee, if necessary to carry out the purposes of the trust, to sell all or any part of the property held under the trust and to invest the proceeds of such sale in kinds or classes of property which are lawful investments for trustees of estates.  No such decree, after its entry, shall thereafter operate to relieve any trustee of any duty imposed by law relating to the investment of trust funds and the exercise of reasonable care for the preservation thereof.  This section shall not be construed to limit or restrict the general equitable jurisdiction of the court over trustees, trusts or trust funds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 498:4-a Cy Pres Doctrine. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The superior court shall exercise jurisdiction pursuant to RSA 498:4-a through RSA 498:4-e only where the claims or defenses raised are related to a matter otherwise pending before or within the jurisdiction of the superior court.  In all other cases involving the doctrine of cy pres, jurisdiction shall lie in the probate court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If property is or has been given in trust to be applied to a charitable purpose, and said purpose or its application is or becomes impossible or impracticable or illegal or obsolete or ineffective or prejudicial to the public interest to carry out, the trust will not fail.  Upon petition by the trustee or trustees or the attorney general, the superior court may direct the application of the property to some charitable purpose which is useful to the community, and which charitable purpose fulfills as nearly as possible the general charitable intent of the settlor or testator.  In applying the doctrine of cy pres, the court may order the distribution of the trust assets to another charitable trustor to a charitable corporation to be held and administered by it in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument as said terms may be modified by the application of cy pres under this section and RSA 498:4-b.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Prior to any court proceeding under this chapter on the intent to offer for sale or change the use of any land, buildings, or both, given, devised, or bequeathed to the town for charitable purposes, the municipality shall hold at least one public hearing with no less than 14 days notice.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Modifying or enlarging the powers granted the trustee, or declaring that a trustee does not have certain powers under New Hampshire law to the extent necessary in order to bring the terms of the governing instrument into compliance with the tax exemption requirements of federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Authorizing the trustee to make charitable distributions from principal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Terminating the trust and directing the distribution of the trust assets to another charitable trust or to a charitable corporation, to be held and administered in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument as said terms may be modified by the application of cy pres under RSA 498:4-a and this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Removing the trustee or trustees, or directing the appointment of new or additional trustees.

An action may also be brought in the superior court by the holder of a tax collector's deed who desires to quiet his title to the property conveyed under such deed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 498:5-b Title in Persons Unknown and Persons Not Located. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In any action brought under the provisions of RSA 498:5-a, if the plaintiff therein alleges that there are or that he believes there are or that there may be persons who have or may have some estate or interest in such real or personal property, but such persons cannot be located and are unknown to the plaintiff, and describes the actual or possible estate or interest of such person or persons, and how derived, so far as may be known to him from the available land records or otherwise, or if the party who may have an interest or estate in such property is a corporation whose corporate existence has been legally terminated or such corporation is no longer in existence or doing business, and in the complaint the plaintiff describes as parties defendant "the unknown persons who claim any interest or estate in and to the subject matter of this action,'' it shall not be necessary to set forth therein any further description of such unknown persons.  If the plaintiff or his attorney annexes to the complaint in such action an affidavit setting forth such facts and in addition sets forth the efforts which were made to ascertain the names and addresses as well as the interest or estates of such unknown persons, the court to which such action is brought may make such order relative to the notice which shall be given in such cause as such court deems reasonable.  Such notice, having been given according to the order and duly proven, shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction of all such unknown persons and the court may proceed to a hearing of the cause at the first term or session, or afterwards as it deems proper.  Such court in its discretion may appoint any guardian or other person to represent such unknown persons under any legal disabilities and all such persons shall be concluded by any decree or judgment in respect to the real or personal property involved in such action.

No judgment for costs shall be rendered in such action against any defendant, who, by his answer, disclaims all estate or interest in or encumbrance on such property, but costs shall be taxed in his favor at the discretion of the court;  and the court shall, in any such case, without further proof, render judgment that such defendant has no estate, interest in or encumbrance on such property or any part thereof.

The court in any action brought under the provisions of RSA 498:5-a shall hear the several claims and determine the rights of the parties, whether derived from deeds, wills or other instruments or courses of title, and may determine the construction of the same, and may render judgment determining the questions and disputes and quieting and settling the title to such property.  In any case in which a tax sale is adjudged invalid, the court, as a condition precedent to the entry of a decree setting aside such sale, shall require the claimant of the property in question to pay to the purchaser a sum of money equal to the amount paid by such purchaser at the tax sale in question, including fees prescribed by law and the amounts paid by such purchaser to satisfy any taxes assessed against the property in question subsequent to such tax sale, with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of such sale or date of payment of such subsequent taxes to the date of the decree.

I. A person claiming title to real property may bring an action in superior court to extinguish rights to minerals deeded at least 50 years before the filing of the action, by a predecessor in title, to any person who is unknown to the plaintiff or cannot be located, or if the party who may hold such mineral rights is a corporation no longer in existence or doing business or whose existence has been legally terminated.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the plaintiff describes in the complaint as parties defendant "the unknown persons who claim any interest or estate in (and to) the subject matter of this action,'' it shall not be necessary to set forth any further description of the unknown persons.  If the plaintiff annexes to the complaint an affidavit setting forth the facts and the efforts made to ascertain the names and addresses of the unknown persons, the court may make a reasonable order relative to notice.  Notice given under the order shall confer jurisdiction over all such unknown persons and the court may proceed to a hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The court in any action brought under this section shall hear any claims, and if the court finds that the claims have been on record for 50 years or more before the date on which the action is filed, the court may enter a decree that the owners of the mineral rights shall be forever barred from enforcing them against the plaintiff, his heirs, and assigns.
