<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Modifying or enlarging the powers granted the trustee, or declaring that a trustee does not have certain powers under New Hampshire law to the extent necessary in order to bring the terms of the governing instrument into compliance with the tax exemption requirements of federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Authorizing the trustee to make charitable distributions from principal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Terminating the trust and directing the distribution of the trust assets to another charitable trust or to a charitable corporation, to be held and administered in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument as said terms may be modified by the application of cy pres under RSA 498:4-a and this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Removing the trustee or trustees, or directing the appointment of new or additional trustees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
