&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The district court shall have concurrent jurisdiction, subject to appeal, of the prosecution of any violation of a local ordinance, code, or regulation properly adopted pursuant to enabling statutes to the extent that such violation, by statute or by local ordinance, code, or regulation:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Is characterized as a misdemeanor or violation within the meaning of the criminal code, in which case penalties shall be consistent with RSA 651.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Is punishable by a civil penalty, in which case the penalty imposed shall in no event exceed the limits of the district court's civil damages concurrent jurisdiction as set forth in RSA 502-A:14, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Is enforceable by local authorities through the issuance of a cease and desist order, and district court judgment upon such order, pursuant to RSA 676:17-a.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The jurisdiction conferred by this section shall include the procedure for local land use citations and pleas by mail, as provided by RSA 676:17-b, for any offense encompassed by RSA 676:17, and within the limits of paragraph I of this section.
