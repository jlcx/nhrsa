&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 502-A:2 Sessions in Towns Within District. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The purpose of the establishment of this system of district courts is to provide the minimum number of courts which will adequately serve the convenience of the public, both transient and permanent residents of this state.  To accomplish this purpose, districts must serve certain towns within their district having regard for the parties, the seasonal influx of population in certain areas, and such other considerations as the expeditious and effective administration of justice may require.  In addition to the regular sessions which are required to be held in various districts under the provisions of this chapter, or in replacement of a portion of regular sessions, the justice or special justice of each district shall hold special sessions as may best serve the convenience of the communities within their district, provided, however, that no such special session shall be held in any building which does not meet the minimum standards prescribed by the New Hampshire court accreditation commission pursuant to RSA 490:5-c.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The administrative judge of the circuit court established in RSA 490-F shall have the authority to and shall, on an annual basis, establish the number of court sessions and the hours and days of operation required for each district court.  The administrative judge shall consider the convenience of each court's users, caseload, resources, and security.  Each court shall submit a plan for flexible scheduling to the administrative judge that meets the needs of the community served by that court which may include evening, early morning, and/or weekend sessions and other alternative sessions.  In evaluating the community need for alternative sessions, the administrative judge and local courts shall evaluate separately civil suits, small claims, order of notice, motor vehicle matters, and criminal cases to determine the needs of the community.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any plan developed and instituted under paragraphs I and II shall not necessitate additional local expenditures by any political subdivision in accordance with part I, article 28-a of the New Hampshire constitution.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The annual salaries of the special justices of the district courts appointed prior to July 1, 1987, shall be an amount equal to 30 percent of the salary paid to the justices, as provided in paragraph I, or the current annual salary of the special justice for 1987, whichever is greater.  Provided further that the special justice may receive, and all special justices appointed after July 1, 1987, shall receive, per diem compensation determined by the supreme court upon recommendation by the judicial branch administrative council, plus reasonable expenses as determined by the supreme court.  In those cases where prior to July 1, 1987, the special justice was paid on a per diem basis, such per diem payment shall continue unless changed by the supreme court.  In the event of the death, resignation, or retirement of the justice and when no appointment is made to fill the vacancy caused thereby for a period of 60 days, the special justice shall then be paid the salary of the justice until his vacancy is filled.  If the justice is absent due to illness or disqualification for any other reason for a period of more than 60 days, the special justice shall be entitled to the salary of the justice until the justice is able to assume his duties.  Whenever a justice or special justice sits in another court by request, he or she shall be paid the same per diem compensation as is generally allowed to per diem special justices sitting in their own courts, plus reasonable expenses.

The clerk shall separately indicate which fines were for violations of title XXI. Fines and forfeitures collected by the clerk for violations of municipal ordinances, codes, or regulations, except those adopted pursuant to RSA 31:39, I(g);  RSA 41:11;  RSA 47:17, IV, VI, VII, or VIII;  and RSA 105:6 and RSA 105:7, shall be remitted monthly to the treasurer of the municipality prosecuting said violations, for the use of the municipality.  All expenses related to the processing of parking violations and the administrative collection of parking fines shall be the responsibility of the local unit of government, and all fines collected shall be retained in their entirety by the local unit of government.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Nothing in this section shall prevent the court from transferring the collection of fines to a centralized location.  Any fines collected by the central location shall be distributed as indicated in paragraph I.  References to duties and responsibilities of clerks contained in paragraph I shall be deemed to include the central fine collection center as appropriate.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Such defendant shall receive, in addition to his or her summons, a uniform fine schedule which shall contain:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The usual fines for violations of the provisions of RSA 270, 270-A, and 270-E, excluding any offense which is a misdemeanor or felony;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The usual fines for violations of the provisions of title XVIII on fish and game laws, excluding any offense which is a misdemeanor or felony;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The usual fines for violations of title XXI on motor vehicle laws, excluding any offense which is a misdemeanor or felony or is excluded under RSA 262:44;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The usual fines for violations of the provisions of title XIX-A on forestry laws, excluding any offense which is a misdemeanor or felony.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The defendant shall be given a notice of fine indicating the amount of the fine plus penalty assessment at the time the summons is issued;  except, if, for cause, the summoning authority wishes the defendant to appear personally.  Defendants summoned to appear personally must do so on the arraignment date specified in the summons, unless otherwise ordered by the court.  Defendants who are issued a summons and notice of fine and who wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere shall enter their plea on the summons and return it with payment of the fine plus penalty assessment to the division of motor vehicles within 30 days of the date of summons.  Defendants in violation of the provisions of title XVIII shall be subject to the provisions of RSA 207:18 and RSA 214:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Whenever a defendant does not enter a plea by mail prior to the arraignment day or does not appear personally or by counsel on or before that date or move for a continuance, the defendant shall be defaulted and the court shall determine what the fine would be upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and shall impose an administrative processing fee in addition to the fine and penalty assessment, and in the case of violations of title XXI, the defendant's driving privileges shall be suspended as provided in RSA 263:56-a.  The provisions of RSA 207:18 and RSA 214:19, as applicable, shall apply to a defendant in violation of the provisions of title XVIII.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Whenever a defendant otherwise fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance in connection with a summons for any violation level offense set forth in titles XIX-A, XVIII, XXI or XXII, the court shall proceed to hear the state's evidence, by offer of proof or otherwise, and enter a finding in accordance therewith.  In the event a finding of guilty is made, the court shall set the fine, and the clerk shall forthwith mail or deliver to the defendant at the defendant's last known mailing address a notice of finding and imposition of fine form approved by the administrative judge of the district court, appointed pursuant to supreme court rule.  Payment of the fine in full shall be required no later than 30 days from the date of said notice.  Upon the failure of any defendant to remit said payment, the procedure required by subparagraph II(a) shall be followed by the court.  No finding made by the court under this section shall be set aside except for good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In defaulted cases of violations of title XXI or title XVIII, the court shall notify the director of the division of motor vehicles of the defendant's default of a title XXI violation, or the executive director of the department of fish and game of the defendant's default of a title XVIII violation, and the amounts of the fine and other penalties on a form prescribed by the director of the division of motor vehicles or the executive director of the department of fish and game, as appropriate.  The amount of the administrative processing fee shall be determined by the New Hampshire supreme court in accordance with the provisions of paragraph V of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) The commissioner of safety may notify, by electronic means, the administrative judge or the administrative judge's designee of all defendants who have failed to comply under RSA 502-A:19-b, II(a).  The commissioner shall certify that the defendants are in default, have been notified, and have failed to respond.  The court may, in its discretion, find the defendant administratively guilty.  No such finding shall be vacated, except for good cause shown.  If the court finds the defendant administratively guilty, the court shall issue an electronic civil bench warrant within 30 days.  In addition, the court may issue an electronic warrant for the arrest of any defendant who:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Is defaulted in accordance with the provisions of RSA 502-A:19-b, II;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Fails to pay a fine or other penalty imposed or issues a bad check in payment of a fine or other penalty;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Fails to comply with a similar order of the director or a court on any matter within the director's or court's jurisdiction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) For purposes of this section, civil bench warrants may be issued by the court in the jurisdiction in which the underlying offense occurred or by the administrative judge or any district court justice designated by the administrative judge, in accordance with procedures set forth by the administrative judge.  Bench warrants may be transmitted electronically.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A person arrested pursuant to this section shall be given the option to pay the outstanding fine and fees in full to a bail commissioner.  Upon such payment, the matter shall be deemed closed, and the civil bench warrant vacated.  All payments received by bail commissioners pursuant to this section shall be transmitted to the court or the division of motor vehicles within 5 business days.  The bail commissioner shall be entitled to a fee for services as set forth in RSA 597:20.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any person arrested pursuant to this section who is unable to pay all outstanding fines and fees prior to release shall be released on personal recognizance and ordered to appear before the district court in the jurisdiction where the arrest or the underlying violation occurred at the next scheduled session of that court.  Prior to release, the defendant shall provide an accurate residential and mailing address and telephone number to a bail commissioner.  The bail commissioner shall be entitled to a fee for services as set forth in RSA 597:20.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) At any hearing held pursuant to subparagraph (d), the defendant shall complete under oath an affidavit of financial assets, which shall be reviewed by the court for determination of the defendant's ability to pay the fines and fees imposed.
