&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 461-A:3 Procedure and Jurisdiction. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The procedure in cases concerning parental rights and responsibilities, including child support, shall be the same as the procedure for petitions for divorce and legal separation under RSA 458.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the court, upon proper application and notice to the adverse party, may revise and modify any order made by it, make such new orders as may be necessary, and may award costs as justice may require.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In cases where husband and wife or unwed parents are living apart, the court, upon petition of either party, may make such order as to parental rights and responsibilities and support of the children as justice may require.  All applicable provisions of this chapter and of RSA 458-A, 458-B, 458-C, and 458-D shall apply to such proceedings.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The jurisdiction granted by this section shall be limited by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, if another state has jurisdiction as provided in that act.  For the purposes of interpreting that act and any other provision of law which refers to a custodial parent, including but not limited to RSA 458-A, any parent with 50 percent or more of the residential responsibility shall be considered a custodial parent.
