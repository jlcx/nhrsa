&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 461-A:22 Modification of Agreements on College Expenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
Every agreement made under RSA 461-A:21 shall state whether the agreement either is modifiable or is not modifiable.  To qualify as not modifiable, the agreement shall state a specific dollar amount to be contributed by either or both parents.  If the parents' agreement states that it is modifiable, the legal test for modification shall be a substantial change in circumstances that was not foreseeable when the agreement was signed.
