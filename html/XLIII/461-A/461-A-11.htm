&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 461-A:11 Modification of Parental Rights and Responsibilities. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The court may issue an order modifying a permanent order concerning parental rights and responsibilities under any of the following circumstances:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The parties agree to a modification.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the court finds repeated, intentional, and unwarranted interference by a parent with the residential responsibilities of the other parent, the court may order a change in the parental rights and responsibilities without the necessity of showing harm to the child, if the court determines that such change would be in accordance with the best interests of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child's present environment is detrimental to the child's physical, mental, or emotional health, and the advantage to the child of modifying the order outweighs the harm likely to be caused by a change in environment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) If the parties have substantially equal periods of residential responsibility for the child and either each asserts or the court finds that the original allocation of parental rights and responsibilities is not working, the court may order a change in allocation of parental rights and responsibilities based on a finding that the change is in the best interests of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a minor child is of sufficient maturity to make a sound judgment, the court may give substantial weight to the preference of the mature minor child as to the parent with whom he or she wants to live.  Under these circumstances, the court shall also give due consideration to other factors which may have affected the minor child's preference, including whether the minor child's preference was based on undesirable or improper influences.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The modification makes either a minimal change or no change in the allocation of parenting time between the parents, and the court determines that such change would be in the best interests of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as provided in RSA 461-A:11, I(b)-(f) for parenting schedules and RSA 461-A:12 for a request to relocate the residence of a child, the court may issue an order modifying any section of a permanent parenting plan based on the best interest of the child.  RSA 461-A:5, III shall apply to any request to modify decision-making responsibility.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. For the purposes of this section, the burden of proof shall be on the moving party.
