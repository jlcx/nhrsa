<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Because children do best when both parents have a stable and meaningful involvement in their lives, it is the policy of this state, unless it is clearly shown that in a particular case it is detrimental to a child, to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Support frequent and continuing contact between each child and both parents.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Encourage parents to share in the rights and responsibilities of raising their children after the parents have separated or divorced.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Encourage parents to develop their own parenting plan with the assistance of legal and mediation professionals, unless there is evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or neglect.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Grant parents and courts the widest discretion in developing a parenting plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Consider both the best interests of the child in light of the factors listed in RSA 461-A:6 and the safety of the parties in developing a parenting plan.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. This chapter shall be construed so as to promote the policy stated in this section.
