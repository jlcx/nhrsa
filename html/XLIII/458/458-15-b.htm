<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Prior to a hearing regarding child support, property settlement, or alimony, both parties shall submit financial affidavits.  The financial affidavits shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts reflected therein unless challenged by a party.  Any party aggrieved by a false statement in a financial affidavit filed pursuant to this chapter may file a civil action for money damages.  In any such civil action, a party proving that the other party made a knowing false statement on a financial affidavit shall be entitled to receive treble damages and attorney's fees.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. Except as provided in paragraph III, all financial affidavits filed under this chapter shall be confidential and accessible only to the parties, their attorneys, the guardian ad litem, department of health and human services employees responsible for child support administration, persons specified in RSA 161-B:7, III, and state and federal officials for the purpose of carrying out their official functions.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any person who knowingly discloses a financial affidavit to any person not authorized to obtain the financial affidavit under this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  This paragraph shall not apply to documents released by a court pursuant to paragraph III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding paragraph I, the court may grant access to a financial affidavit filed under this chapter to a person upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the public interest served by release of the information outweighs the private interest served by maintaining the privacy of the financial affidavit.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the right of the public to access court records shall not, absent further cause, constitute sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of privacy contained in paragraph I.
