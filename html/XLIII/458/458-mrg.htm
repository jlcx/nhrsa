<codesect>
A divorce from the bonds of matrimony shall be decreed, irrespective of the fault of either party, on the ground of irreconcilable differences which have caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.  In any pleading or hearing of a petition for divorce under this section, allegations or evidence of specific acts of misconduct shall be improper and inadmissible, except where parental rights and responsibilities are an issue and such evidence is relevant to establish that a particular allocation of parental rights and responsibilities would be detrimental to the child or at a hearing where it is determined by the court to be necessary to establish the existence of irreconcilable differences.  If, upon hearing of an action for divorce under this section, both parties are found to have committed an act or acts which justify a finding of irreconcilable differences, a divorce shall be decreed and the acts of one party shall not negate the acts of the other nor bar the divorce decree.  The court's findings and decree may be based on oral testimony or written stipulations of the parties.

<center><h3>Section 458:9</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 458:9 Venue;  Notice. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
All petitions initiated under RSA 168-A, RSA 458, and RSA 458-C shall be brought in the county in which either party lives and before the superior court;  and notice thereof shall be given to the respondent as required by this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. If the parties file a joint petition, the petition shall be filed at the appropriate court without further service or notice required.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. An individual petition shall be filed with the appropriate court, together with the filing fee, by the petitioner.  Upon the filing of a petition, the court shall issue orders of notice, attached to the petition, which the petitioner shall then serve on the respondent as provided in this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Service within the state shall be made either by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) A sheriff, in hand or by leaving an attested copy of the petition, orders of notice, and an appearance form at the respondent's abode, within 25 days of receipt of orders of notice.  The return of service shall state the street and number, or some other description, of the abode.  The petitioner shall file the return of service with the court as proof of service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery, mailed within 7 days of receipt of orders of notice, signed by the addressee only.  The petitioner shall file the return receipt with the court as proof of service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Service outside the state shall be made either by:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) An officer authorized to make service of process in the state where the respondent lives.  Proof of out-of-state service shall be made by a return of the officer under oath, accompanied by an official certificate of his or her official character or authority.  The petitioner shall file the return of service with the court as proof of service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery, signed by the addressee only.  The petitioner shall file the return receipt with the court as proof of service.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II-a. In lieu of service as described in paragraph II, the court may, after issuing orders of notice, send notice to the respondent indicating that the petition has been filed and that the respondent or the respondent's attorney may accept service at the court within 10 days.  If neither the respondent nor the attorney for the respondent accepts service at the court within 10 days as specified in the correspondence, the petition shall be forwarded to the petitioner for service in accordance with paragraph II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When the residence of the respondent is not known, the petition shall state the respondent's last known post office address, and the name and post office address of some near relative of the respondent, if any is known to the petitioner, and otherwise the name and post office address of some friend of the respondent, such facts to be verified by the petitioner's personal affidavit filed with the petition.  The petitioner shall file the petition with the court together with the name and address of a newspaper published in the city or town nearest to the respondent's last known address.  Service shall then be ordered by publication in the newspaper, with publication to be completed not less than 15 days before the return date, and by certified mail addressed to the respondent, care of the relative or friend of the respondent, or otherwise as the court may order.  Publication may be waived for good cause upon motion to the court.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. In this section:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) "Mediation'' means a process in which a neutral third party facilitates settlement discussions between parties.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) "Mediator'' means a family mediator, certified pursuant to RSA 328-C, who has contracted with the court to participate in court-referred mediation under this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court may order the parties to participate in mediation upon the request of either party or at the discretion of the court.  If the parties are ordered to participate in mediation under this section, all issues relevant to their case, including but not limited to property settlement and alimony also shall be mediated unless the court orders otherwise.  Mediation may not be ordered pursuant to this section if the case involves minor children and the parties are eligible for mediation under RSA 461-A:7.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Reasons the court may choose not to order mediation include, but are not limited to, the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A showing of undue hardship to a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) An agreement between the parties for alternate dispute resolution procedures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) A finding of alcoholism or drug abuse unless all parties agree to mediation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) An allegation of serious psychological or emotional abuse.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Lack of an available, suitable mediator within a reasonable time period.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The court shall not order mediation if there is a finding of domestic violence as defined in RSA 173-B:1, unless all parties agree to mediation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The mediator has no authority to make a decision or impose a settlement upon the parties.  The mediator shall attempt to focus the attention of the parties upon their needs and interests rather than upon their positions.  Any settlement is entirely voluntary.  In the absence of settlement, the parties lose none of their rights to a resolution of their dispute through litigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Either party may move to have the mediator replaced for good cause.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Mediation proceedings shall be held in private, and all communications, oral or written, made during the proceedings, which relate to the issues being mediated, whether made by the mediator, or a party, or any other person present, shall be privileged and confidential and shall not be disclosed and shall not be admissible in court, except as provided in RSA 328-C:9.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Any mediated agreement reached by the parties on all or some of the disputed issues shall be reduced to writing, signed by each party, and filed with the court as soon as practicable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The parties shall participate at mediation in good faith.  If the mediator determines that mediation is not helpful in resolving the dispute, the mediator shall report that fact to the court and return the matter to the court for adjudication of the underlying issues.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 458:16 Temporary Relief and Permanent Restraining Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. After the filing of a petition for divorce, annulment, separation or a decree of nullity, the superior court may issue orders with such conditions and limitations as the court deems just which may, at the discretion of the court, be made on a temporary or permanent basis.  Temporary orders may be issued ex parte.  Said orders may be to the following effect:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Directing any party to refrain from abusing or interfering in any way with the person or liberty of the other party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Enjoining any party from entering the premises wherein the other party resides upon a showing that physical or emotional harm would otherwise result.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Enjoining any party from contacting the other party at, or entering, the other party's place of employment or school.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Enjoining any party from harassing, intimidating or threatening the other party, other party's relatives regardless of their place of residences, or the other party's household members in any way.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Determining the temporary custody and maintenance of any minor children as shall be deemed expedient for the benefit of the children;  provided, however, that no preference shall be given to either parent in awarding such custody because of the parent's sex.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Ordering a temporary allowance to be paid for the support of the other.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Enjoining any party from transferring, encumbering, hypothecating, concealing or in any way disposing of any property, real or personal, except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life, and if such order is directed against a party, it may require such party to notify the other party of any proposed extraordinary expenditures and to account to the court for all such extraordinary expenditures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Ordering the sale of the marital residence provided that both parties have previously filed a written stipulation with the clerk of the court explicitly agreeing to the sale of the property prior to the final hearing on the merits.  If the parties have not so stipulated, the sale of the marital residence shall not be ordered prior to the final hearing as long as the court deems the party residing within the marital residence to have sufficient financial resources to pay the debts or obligations generated by the property, including mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, and ordinary maintenance, as those debts and obligations come due.
<br>

II. (a) Ex parte orders may be granted without written or oral notice to the adverse party only if the court finds from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified petition, that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant, the children, or property before the adverse party or attorney can be heard in opposition.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(o) Any other factor that the court deems relevant.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If either or both parties retain an ownership interest in an education savings account held on behalf of a child of the marriage, including a qualified tuition program under 26 U.S.C. Section 529, the court may, in its discretion, preserve the account for its original purpose or may treat the account as property of the marriage subject to equitable division under this section.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon motion of either party for alimony payments, the court shall make orders for the payment of alimony to the party in need of alimony, either temporary or permanent, for a definite or indefinite period of time, if the motion for alimony payments is made within 5 years of the decree of nullity or divorce and the court finds that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The party in need lacks sufficient income, property, or both, including property apportioned in accordance with RSA 458:16-a, to provide for such party's reasonable needs, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The party from whom alimony is sought is able to meet reasonable needs while meeting those of the party seeking alimony, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The party in need is unable to be self-supporting through appropriate employment at a standard of living that meets reasonable needs or is allocated parental rights and responsibilities under RSA 461-A for a child of the parties whose condition or circumstances make it appropriate that the parent not seek employment outside the home.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Upon motion of either party, the court may make orders for the payment of an alimony allowance when such orders would be just and equitable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Upon a decree of nullity or divorce, or upon the renewal, modification, or extension of a prior order for alimony, the court may order alimony to be paid for such length of time as the parties may agree or the court orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. (a) The court may make orders for alimony in a lump sum, periodic payments, or both.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In determining the amount of alimony, the court shall consider the length of the marriage;  the age, health, social or economic status, occupation, amount and sources of income, the property awarded under RSA 458:16-a, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties;  the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income;  the fault of either party as defined in RSA 458:16-a, II(l);  and the federal tax consequences of the order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In determining amount and sources of income, the court shall not consider a minor child's social security benefit payments or a second or subsequent spouse's income. The court may consider veterans' disability benefits collected by either or both parties to the extent permitted by federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The court may also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation, or appreciation in value of their respective estates and the noneconomic contribution of each of the parties to the family unit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) In any proceeding for modification of an existing alimony order, the earned or unearned income and social security disability payments of a spouse of the obligor party shall not be considered a source of income to that obligor party for the purpose of modification, unless the obligor party resigns from or refuses employment or is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, in which case the income of a subsequent spouse may be imputed to the obligor party only to the extent that such obligor party could have earned income in his or her usual employment. In such actions, the court may consider the veteran's disability benefits of a spouse of the obligor party to the extent permitted by federal law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The unanticipated consequences of changes in federal tax legislation or regulations may be grounds to modify any alimony order or agreement.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The court shall specify written reasons for the granting or denial of any motion for an alimony allowance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. In cases where the court issues an order for permanent alimony for a definite period of time, such order may be renewed, upon the petition of either party, provided that such petition is made within 5 years of the termination date of the permanent alimony order.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change or alter in any way the terms of the original alimony order.
