<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Determining the temporary custody and maintenance of any minor children as shall be deemed expedient for the benefit of the children;  provided, however, that no preference shall be given to either parent in awarding such custody because of the parent's sex.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) Ex parte orders may be granted without written or oral notice to the adverse party only if the court finds from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified petition, that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant, the children, or property before the adverse party or attorney can be heard in opposition.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) A determination by the court that such notice or attempt at notice was timely so as to afford the other party an opportunity to be present.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If temporary orders are made ex parte, the party against whom the orders are issued may file a written request with the clerk of the superior court and request a hearing thereon.  Such a hearing shall be held no later than 5 days after the request is received by the clerk for the county in which the petition for divorce, annulment, separation or decree of nullity is filed.
<br>

III. When a party violates a restraining order issued under this section by committing assault, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, stalking, or another criminal act, that party shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and peace officers shall arrest the party, detain the party pursuant to RSA 594:19-a and refer the party for prosecution.
