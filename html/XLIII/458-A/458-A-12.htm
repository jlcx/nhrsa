<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A court of another state does not have jurisdiction under subparagraph (a), or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this state is the more appropriate forum under RSA 458-A:18 or RSA 458-A:19, and:

(1) The child and the child's parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence;  and

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All courts having jurisdiction under subparagraph (a) or (b) have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under RSA 458-A:18 or RSA 458-A:19.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in subparagraph (a), (b), or (c).
