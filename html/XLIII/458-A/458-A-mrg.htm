<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A court of this state determines that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent have a significant connection with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state concerning the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships;  or

If a child-custody proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under RSA 458-A:12 through RSA 458-A:14, a child-custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination, if it so provides and this state becomes the home state of the child.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 458-A:15, a court of this state, before hearing a child-custody proceeding, shall examine the court documents and other information supplied by the parties pursuant to RSA 458-A:20.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. In a proceeding to modify a child-custody determination, a court of this state shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been commenced in another state.  If a proceeding to enforce a child-custody determination has been commenced in another state, the court may:

I. A court of this state which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child-custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.  The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction.  For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A court of this state may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 458-A:15, if a court of this state has jurisdiction under this chapter because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under RSA 458-A:12 through RSA 458-A:14 determines that this state is a more appropriate forum under RSA 458-A:18;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in RSA 458-A:12 through RSA 458-A:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a court of this state declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph I it may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child-custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under RSA 458-A:12 through RSA 458-A:14.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph I, it shall assess against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication expenses, attorney's fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and child care during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate.  The court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against this state unless authorized by law other than this chapter.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A child-custody determination issued by a court of another state may be registered in this state, with or without a simultaneous request for enforcement, by sending to the office of the clerk of the superior court:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A letter or other document requesting registration;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(c) Except as otherwise provided in RSA 458-A:20, the name and address of the person seeking registration and any parent or person acting as a parent who has been awarded custody or visitation in the child-custody determination sought to be registered.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. On receipt of the documents required by paragraph I the registering court shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) A registered determination is enforceable as of the date of the registration in the same manner as a determination issued by a court of this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A hearing to contest the validity of the registered determination must be requested within 20 days after service of notice;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Failure to contest the registration will result in confirmation of the child-custody determination and preclude further contest of that determination with respect to any matter that could have been asserted.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A person seeking to contest the validity of a registered order must request a hearing within 20 days after service of the notice.  At that hearing, the court shall confirm the registered order unless the person contesting registration establishes that:

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Confirmation of a registered order, whether by operation of law or after notice and hearing, precludes further contest of the order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted at the time of registration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 458-A:32 Warrant to Take Physical Custody of Child. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Upon the filing of a petition seeking enforcement of a child-custody determination, the petitioner may file a verified application for the issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child if the child is immediately likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this state.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other witness, finds that the child is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this state, it may issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child.  The petition must be heard on the next judicial day after the warrant is executed unless that date is impossible.  In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.  The application for the warrant must include the statements required by RSA 458-A:29, II.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A warrant to take physical custody of a child must:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Recite the facts upon which a conclusion of imminent serious physical harm or removal from the jurisdiction is based;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Provide for the placement of the child pending final relief.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The respondent must be served with the petition, warrant, and order immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable throughout this state.  If the court finds on the basis of the testimony of the petitioner or other witness that a less intrusive remedy is not effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child.  If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. The court may impose conditions upon placement of a child to ensure the appearance of the child and the child's custodian.
