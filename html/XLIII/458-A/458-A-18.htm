&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A court of this state which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child-custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.  The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction.  For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The length of time the child has resided outside this state;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The relative financial circumstances of the parties;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a court of this state determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A court of this state may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.
