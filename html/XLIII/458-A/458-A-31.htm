&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 458-A:31 Hearing and Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unless the court issues a temporary emergency order pursuant to RSA 458-A:15, upon a finding that a petitioner is entitled to immediate physical custody of the child, the court shall order that the petitioner may take immediate physical custody of the child unless the respondent establishes that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The child-custody determination has not been registered and confirmed under RSA 458-A:26 and that:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The issuing court did not have jurisdiction under RSA 458-A:12 through RSA 458-A:21;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The child-custody determination for which enforcement is sought has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court of a state having jurisdiction to do so under RSA 458-A:12 through RSA 458-A:21;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The respondent was entitled to notice, but notice was not given in accordance with the standards of RSA 458-A:7, in the proceedings before the court that issued the order for which enforcement is sought;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The child-custody determination for which enforcement is sought was registered and confirmed under RSA 458-A:26 but has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court of a state having jurisdiction to do so under RSA 458-A:12 through RSA 458-A:21.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The court shall award the fees, costs, and expenses authorized under RSA 458-A:33 and may grant additional relief, including a request for the assistance of law enforcement officials, and set a further hearing to determine whether additional relief is appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. If a party called to testify refuses to answer on the ground that the testimony may be self-incriminating, the court may draw an adverse inference from the refusal.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A privilege against disclosure of communications between spouses and a defense of immunity based on the relationship of husband and wife or parent and child may not be invoked in a proceeding under this subdivision.
