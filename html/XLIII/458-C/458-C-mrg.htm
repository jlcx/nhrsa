I. Both parents shall share responsibility for economic support of the children.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The children in an obligor's initial family are entitled to a standard of living equal to that of the obligor's subsequent families.

<p>
[Paragraph III effective until July 1, 2013;  see also paragraph III set out below.]
</p>
</center>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The percentage of net income paid for child support should vary according to the number of children and, with limited exemptions, not according to income level.

In addition, the following shall apply:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The court, in its discretion, may consider as gross income the difference between the amount a parent is earning and the amount a parent has earned in cases where the parent voluntarily becomes unemployed or underemployed, unless the parent is physically or mentally incapacitated.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The income of either parent's current spouse shall not be considered as gross income to the parent unless the parent resigns from or refuses employment or is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, in which case the income of the spouse shall be imputed to the parent to the extent that the parent had earned income in his or her usual employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The court, in its discretion, may order that child support based on one-time or irregular income be paid when the income is received, rather than be included in the weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly child support calculation.  Such support shall be based on the applicable percentage of net income.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

(b) The department of health and human services shall calculate and publish a schedule of child support amounts using the table in subparagraph (a).  The schedule shall provide child support amounts in $1,000 increments of combined net income, with a directly proportional change in the percentage of combined net income devoted to child support based on income level and number of children.  The department shall determine the fractional percentage between each income level by interpolating between the percentages within each column of the table under subparagraph (a).  Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the department from publishing child support guidelines in increments of less than $1,000, based on the schedule and formula provided in this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The total support obligation shall be determined by multiplying the parents' total net income, as defined in RSA 458-C:2, VI, by the appropriate percentage derived from this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The total child support obligation shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their respective incomes as adjusted by this section, except when there are incurred by the obligee child care expenses or for the actual amount paid as the medical support obligation, for the minor children to whom the child support order applies.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) For those cases involving allowable child care expenses or medical support obligation expenses incurred by the obligee, the same methodology described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall be used, except that as part of the determination of each parent's share of the child support obligation, the obligee's allowable child care expenses or medical support obligation expenses shall be deducted from the adjusted gross income of the obligee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) If the obligor parent's gross income is less than the self-support reserve and the court has determined that the obligor is not voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, the court shall order the child support obligation in the amount of a minimum support order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the obligor parent's gross income is greater than the self-support reserve but payment of the order as calculated under this chapter would reduce the obligor parent's income below the self-support reserve, the obligor parent's share of the total support obligation shall be presumed to be the difference between the self-support reserve and that parent's adjusted gross income, but in any event shall be no less than the amount of a minimum support order.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) [Repealed].
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The court shall establish and order a reasonable medical support obligation for each parent.  The presumptive amount of a reasonable medical support obligation shall be 4 percent of the individual parent's gross income, unless the court establishes and orders a different amount based on a written finding or a specific finding, made by the presiding officer on the record, that the presumptive amount would be unjust or inappropriate, using the criteria set forth in RSA 458-C:5.

At every hearing in which child support is involved, the party seeking the order shall file a child support guideline worksheet, as published by the department of health and human services, division of child support services, duly completed by either the party or attorney.  The other party shall file a child support guideline worksheet if the guideline amount is in dispute.  If the court or court personnel complete or assist the parties in the completion of a child support guidelines worksheet, the worksheet shall be retained in the court file and made available for inspection at the request of the parties.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II.

<center><h3>Section 458-C:5</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 458-C:5 Adjustments to the Application of Guidelines Under Special Circumstances. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Special circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following, if raised by any party to the action or by the court, shall be considered in light of the best interests of the child and may result in adjustments in the application of support guidelines provided under this chapter.  The court shall make written findings relative to the applicability of the following:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Ongoing extraordinary medical, dental or education expenses, including expenses related to the special needs of a child, incurred on behalf of the involved children.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Significantly high or low income of the obligee or obligor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) In considering an adjustment when one or both parents have high income, the court shall consider whether the child support amount derived from application of the guidelines substantially exceeds the child's or children's reasonable needs, taking into account the style of living to which the child or children have become accustomed or will experience in either party's home.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In considering an adjustment when one or both parents have low income, the court shall determine how to optimize use of the parents' combined incomes to arrive at the best possible outcome for the child or children, provided that the basic support needs of the child or children are met.  In making this determination, the court may consider income tax consequences, the earned income tax credit, the allocation of the right of a parent to claim a child as a dependent for income tax purposes, and other child-related tax benefits.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The economic consequences of the presence of stepparents, step-children or natural or adopted children.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Reasonable expenses incurred by the obligor parent in exercising parental rights and responsibilities, provided that the reasonable expenses incurred by the obligee parent for the minor children can be met regardless of such adjustment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The economic consequences to either party of the disposition of a marital home made for the benefit of the child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The opportunity to optimize both parties' after-tax income by taking into account federal tax consequences of an order of support, including the right to claim the child or children as dependents for income tax purposes.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) State tax obligations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Parenting schedule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Equal or approximately equal parenting residential responsibilities in and of itself shall not eliminate the need for child support and shall not by itself constitute ground for an adjustment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) In considering requests for adjustments to the application of the child support guidelines based on the parenting schedule, the court may consider the following factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(A) Whether, in cases of equal or approximately equal residential responsibility, the parties have agreed to the specific apportionment of variable expenses for the children, including but not limited to education, school supplies, day care, after school, vacation and summer care, extracurricular activities, clothing, health insurance costs and uninsured health costs, and other child-related expenses.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(B) Whether the obligor parent has established that the equal or approximately equal residential responsibility will result in a reduction of any of the fixed costs of child rearing incurred by the obligee parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(C) Whether the income of the lower earning parent enables that parent to meet the costs of child rearing in a similar or approximately equal style to that of the other parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) The economic consequences to either party of providing for the voluntary or court-ordered postsecondary educational expenses of a natural or adopted child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Other special circumstances found by the court to avoid an unreasonably low or confiscatory support order, taking all relevant circumstances into consideration.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The party relying on the provisions of this section shall demonstrate special circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 458-C:7 Modification of Order. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) The obligor or obligee may apply to the court or, when the department of health and human services has issued a legal order of support pursuant to RSA 161-C, to the department, whichever issued the existing order, for modification of such order 3 years after the entry of the last order for support, without the need to show a substantial change of circumstances.  This section shall not prohibit the obligor or obligee from applying at any time for a modification based on substantial change of circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Not less than once every 3 years the department shall provide notice to the parties subject to a child support order payable through the department informing them of their right to request a review, and, if appropriate, the right to apply for adjustment of the child support order.  The notice provision may be included as part of the initial support order or any subsequent orders.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Not less than once every 3 years the department shall review all child support orders in which there is an assignment to the department pursuant to Title IV-A of the Social Security Act and, if appropriate, apply for adjustment of the child support order in accordance with the child support guidelines.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Any child support modification shall not be effective prior to the date that notice of the petition for modification has been given to the respondent. "Notice'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Service as specified in civil actions;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Acceptance of a copy of the petition, as long as the petition is filed no later than 30 days following said acceptance, and as long as the petitioner provides proof of acceptance by a certified mail receipt.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect service as required by law.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Whenever the court, pursuant to this chapter, modifies a support order which results in an overpayment of support, the court shall order, absent a showing of undue hardship, the obligee to directly reimburse the obligor for such overpayment of support or order an adjustment to the modified support order until reimbursement of the overpayment has been satisfied.  Any reimbursement ordered shall be only for an overpayment that occurs after the date that notice of the petition for modification of support order was given to the respondent.  The court shall enter an order for reimbursement as a provision of the modified order, which order for reimbursement shall take effect 30 days after issuance, unless either the obligor or obligee requests, within such 30-day period, a separate hearing to determine the amount and frequency of reimbursement.
