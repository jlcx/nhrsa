&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 458-E:9 Attorney Fees. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
In making determinations pursuant to this chapter, the court may award attorney's fees and costs based on the court's consideration of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Unreasonable failure of either party to accommodate the other party in parental rights and responsibilities or parent-child contact matters related to a deploying parent.  A parent's refusal to accommodate the other parent shall not be considered unreasonable if the parent demonstrates a reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her child.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Unreasonable delay caused by either party in resolving parental rights and responsibilities or parent-child contact related to a deploying parent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Failure of either party to provide timely information about income and earnings information to the other party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Other factors as the court may consider appropriate and as may be required by law.
