I. When support is payable through the department if income is not subject to immediate assignment under this chapter, including cases subject to a finding of good cause or to a written agreement, before notice of the income assignment may be given to an employer by the department, the obligor shall be given at least 15 days' prior notice of the commencement of income withholding procedures under this chapter.  The notice to the obligor shall include:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount to be withheld.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) A statement that the withholding applies to any current or subsequent employment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The procedures for contesting withholding and that the only basis for contesting withholding is a mistake of fact.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The period within which the obligor must contact the department in order to contest the assignment and that failure to notify the department within the specified time limit will result in the commencement of assignment procedures.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. For orders issued or modified on or after October 1, 1985, when support is not payable through the department and income is not subject to immediate assignment under this chapter, including cases subject to a finding of good cause or to a written agreement, before an individual or a legal representative seeks to establish an income assignment payable directly to an obligee, notice must be given to the obligor at least 15 days prior to commencement of income assignment procedures under this chapter.  The notice to the obligor shall include the notice provisions under subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of paragraph I and a notice of the period within which the obligor must give written notice to the obligee in order to contest the assignment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
