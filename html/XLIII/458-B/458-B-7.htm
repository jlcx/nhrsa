&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) In cases in which support is payable through the department, within 45 days from the date of the notice to the obligor required by RSA 458-B:5, the department shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Provide to the obligor an opportunity to present his case to the department;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Determine if the withholding will occur based on an evaluation of the facts;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Provide notice to the obligor of whether or not the withholding will occur, and if it is to occur, include in the notice the time when the withholding will begin and the information given to the employer in the notice required under RSA 458-B:6.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If the obligor contests the withholding as provided in this section, the notice to the employer required under RSA 458-B:6 shall not be sent until a decision is made under subparagraph I(a)(2).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In cases not subject to immediate assignment under RSA 458-B:2, I and in which support is not payable through the department, and where an obligee is seeking to establish or implement an income assignment under this chapter, if an obligor contests assignment, a judicial determination must be made prior to initiating the income assignment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Assignment may not be contested on the basis that a one-month arrearage does not exist at the time of a judicial or administrative hearing if such an arrearage existed at the time when the notice to the obligor was mailed or any time thereafter.
