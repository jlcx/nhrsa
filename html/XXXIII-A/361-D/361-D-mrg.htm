<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. "Constant yield method'' means:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) In the case of a periodic payment lease the method of determining the lease charge portion of each base lease payment pursuant to which the lease charge for each computational period is earned in advance by multiplying the constant rate implicit in the lease times the balance subject to lease charge as it declines during the lease term.  At any given time during the scheduled term of a periodic payment lease, the balance subject to lease charge shall be the difference between the adjusted capitalized cost and the sum of all depreciation amounts accrued during the preceding computational periods and the first base lease payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of a single payment lease, the method of determining the periodic earning of the lease charge portion of the single lease payment pursuant to which the lease charge for each computational period is earned in advance by multiplying the constant rate implicit in the lease times the balance subject to lease charge as it increases during the lease term.  At any given time during the term of a single payment lease, the balance subject to lease charge shall be determined by subtracting from the residual value the total lease charge scheduled to be earned over the lease term and adding to the difference all lease charges accrued during the preceding computational periods.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In the case of either a periodic payment lease or a single payment lease, the periodic lease charge calculations shall be based on the assumption that the holder will receive the lease payment or payments on their exact due date or dates and that the lease goes to its full term.

The gap amount shall not include any deductible amount applicable to any insurance policy maintained by the lessee or any past due payments owed by the lessee as of the time of the receipt by the lessor of the insurance proceeds, or any other amount due because of the lessee's default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI-a. "Gross capitalized cost'' means the amount agreed upon by the lessor and the lessee as the value of the leased property and any items that are capitalized or amortized during the lease term, including but not limited to taxes, insurance, service agreements, and any outstanding balance from a prior loan or lease.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. "Realized value'' means the greater of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The price received by the lessor for disposition of the vehicle, after subtracting all actual and reasonable expenses of sale.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-D:16 Method for Establishing Realized Value. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. (a) If a lease is terminated early and the lessee does not exercise any purchase option and the lessee's liability is based on the difference between the lease balance and the realized value, or if the lessee's liability at the scheduled end of the lease term is based upon the vehicle's residual value and the lessee does not exercise any purchase option, the holder shall act in a commercially reasonable manner when disposing of the vehicle or obtaining cash bids for the purpose of establishing the realized value of the vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Except in the event of a total loss, within 5 business days of lease termination, a lessee who is not in default and whose lease is terminated early without the exercise of a purchase option or whose liability at the scheduled end of the lease term is based upon the residual value of the vehicle may obtain, at the lessee's expense, a professional appraisal of the wholesale value which could be realized at sale of the vehicle, by an appraiser mutually acceptable to the lessee and the holder, who is not the agent or employee of either the lessor, the dealer or the lessee.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The appraisal shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be used as the realized value in determining the lessee's liability at early termination or at the scheduled end of the lease term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the lessee and the lessor from agreeing upon the vehicle's realized value, in which case the value agreed upon shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be used as the realized value in determining the lessee's liability at early termination or at the scheduled end of the lease term.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event of a total loss of the vehicle prior to the end of the lease term occasioned by its theft, physical damage or other occurrence as specified in the lease, the realized value shall be deemed to be the sum of the amount received by the holder from the lessee's insurance company or from any other party in payment of the loss, and the amount of the lessee's deductible under the lessee's insurance policy received by the holder.  In the event that no amount is received, the realized value of the motor vehicle shall be zero.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-D:17 Restriction on Liability for Early Termination. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The lessee shall have the right to terminate the lease at any time after the lessee has made 12 full periodic lease payments for which lease charges have been accrued by the holder, or, in the case of a single payment lease, at the expiration of 12 months from the consummation of the lease.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the holder from permitting the lessee to terminate the lease before the expiration of 12 months.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a lease is terminated early and there is not a purchase option or the lessee does not exercise any purchase option, the lessee's early termination obligation may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any unpaid lease payments that accrued through the date of early termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any other unpaid amounts, other than excess mileage charges, arising under the terms of the lease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any official fees and taxes imposed in connection with lease termination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) A disposition fee in an amount set forth in the consumer lease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The reasonable costs of retaking, storing, preparing for sale and selling the vehicle, including reasonable attorneys' fees and collection and court costs incurred by the lessor in recovering or securing possession of the vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) The amount, if any, at the time which early termination occurs, by which the balance subject to lease charge plus the lease charge earned in advance for the computational period as defined in the lease, calculated in accordance with the constant yield method or any other generally accepted lease accounting method exceeds the realized value of the vehicle.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Any other early termination charge expressly disclosed in the consumer lease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. As an alternative to the constant yield and other generally accepted lease accounting methods of determining the depreciation amounts accrued through the date of early termination of a precomputed lease transaction, those amounts may be determined under subparagraph II(f) by using a lease provision under which the lease charge is calculated on the adjusted capitalized cost for the time outstanding according to a generally accepted actuarial method.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. This section shall not limit or restrict the manner of calculating the lessee's early termination obligation, whether by way of unamortized capitalized cost, discounted present value of remaining lease payments, multiples of monthly payments or otherwise, provided that the amount or method of calculating the lessee's early termination obligation shall always be conspicuously disclosed in the lease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Any refundable security deposit or advance lease payment held by the holder may be retained by the holder and shall be credited against the lessee's early termination obligation to the extent it has not been applied against other obligations.  The amount of such security deposit or advance lease payment in excess of the amount of the lessee's early termination obligation shall be returned to the lessee.  The holder is not obligated to pay interest to the lessee on the security deposit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-D:19 Assessment of Excess Wear and Damage to the Vehicle. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The lease shall contain a clause complying with the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1677 et seq., which describes the standards for determining excess wear and damage to the vehicle for which the lessee will be liable.  Upon the lessee's exercise of a purchase option, the holder may not charge, receive or collect a charge for excess wear and damage to the vehicle.  The holder may not prohibit the lessee from being present at an inspection for excess wear and damage.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. No later than 45 days after the return of the vehicle, the holder shall present an itemized bill to the lessee by hand delivery at any location or by first class mail or recognized courier service to the address on the holder's records.  The itemized bill shall consist of a listing of the items of excess wear and damage and the amounts to be paid by the lease.  An itemized bill may be comprised of separate documents delivered or mailed separately.  An itemized bill may also include identified charges for excess mileage and other amounts due under the lease.  Mere acknowledgment by the lessee or receipt of an itemized bill shall not operate as an admission of the existence, nature, obligation to pay, or amount of any of the items therein.  The holder shall not be required to prepare an itemized bill in response to wear and damage charges identified in lessee's counter inspection report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Except as provided in this chapter, for inspections at or after the return of the vehicle, the holder shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Provide to the lessee an itemized bill.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Provide to the lessee the following statement:  "You are being asked to pay this amount for excess wear and damage.  If you do not agree with this amount and to preserve valuable rights, you must notify us within 7 days of receipt of this bill of your disagreement and obtain and deliver to us, within 30 days after hand delivery or mailing of this bill, an itemized inspection report and estimate of the cost of repairing such excess wear and damage from an appraiser agreed to by us and, payment of any charges due under the inspection you obtained.  If you properly obtain and deliver such appraisal and tender any amounts due, such appraisal shall be binding on the holder.  If you fail to do so, the holder's inspection shall be conclusive.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) In order for the lessee to obtain a counter-inspection, the holder shall allow the lessee access to the vehicle at a reasonable time and place designated by the holder during the 30 day time period as provided in subparagraph (b).  The holder shall not be required, however, to deliver the vehicle to, or produce the vehicle at, a destination designated by the lessee for such purpose.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the lessee is required, or is given the option, to have the vehicle inspected by the holder prior to scheduled termination, the holder shall provide to the lessee notice of such inspection at least 15 days prior to the last date available for such inspection, which shall not be earlier than 15 days prior to scheduled termination, and notice that unless the lessee obtains a counter-inspector, the holder's inspection at lease end shall be conclusive.  The pre-termination inspection shall be reasonable as to time and place.  In addition to the statement required in paragraph III(b), an itemized bill shall include the following statement:  "If this inspection report was prepared by the holder prior to the scheduled termination, you may avoid excess wear and damage charges by having such items satisfactorily repaired prior to the return of the vehicle.  The holder may inspect the vehicle at or after its return and may seek additional charges only by written notice and only for wear and damage incurred after the date of the holder's vehicle inspection.  In addition, any charges for wear and damage under this inspection or your own inspection shall be due when your lease terminates.''
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. (a) A lessee counter-inspection as provided in this section or, if no such counter-inspection is obtained, a pre-termination itemized bill prepared by the holder as required by this section shall be conclusive upon the holder and not subject to increase at the termination of the lease, except to the extent that such wear and damage was obscured or concealed or is reasonably believed by the holder to have occurred after the initial pre-termination inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) With respect to such additional wear and damage charges, the holder may give the lessee another itemized bill described in paragraphs II and III.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. If the lessee does not present the vehicle for an authorized or required pre-termination inspection, the holder shall give the lessee the itemized bill as described in paragraph II of this section.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. (a) The lessee may obtain at the lessee's expense within the periods provided, a counter-inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) To be considered a "counter-inspection'', the inspection shall:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Be conducted by an inspector reasonably agreed to by the holder.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Be in writing in a form provided by or acceptable to the holder listing the items of excess wear and damage, if any, and the associated estimated cost of repairs according to standards set forth in the lease.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Be delivered to the holder within the applicable time frame.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) If conducted after the vehicle is returned to the lessor, be accompanied by payment of the amount of such excess wear and damage listed on the counter-inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. Absent mathematical or other manifest error, the holder shall accept such counter-inspection as determinative of the lessee's excess wear and damage obligations under the lease with respect to the itemized bill for which the counter-inspection is presented and payment is made.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. If the lessee does not obtain a counter-inspection or a pre-termination inspection, then with respect to such inspection the lessee shall not be in default, notwithstanding any provision in the lessee's lease agreement to the contrary.  If the lessee does not obtain a counter-inspection or, if offered, a pre-termination inspection, the itemized bill described in paragraph II of this section shall be conclusive.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. The holder shall substantially comply with the provisions of this section.  If the holder wishes to charge, receive or collect a charge for excess wear and damage, the exclusive penalty for failure to substantially comply with the provisions of this section shall be a waiver of the right to collect all contested excess wear and damage charges from the lessee.  The holder shall not be required to send any notice if the holder does not wish to collect an excess wear and damage charge.  Nothing in this chapter shall limit the lessee's obligation for any charge for excess mileage or prohibit any agreement between the lessee and the holder relating to wear and damage if such agreement is consistent with the rights given to the lessee.  Nothing shall limit the lessee's liability to holder for odometer rollbacks or obscured or concealed structural or safety related damage discovered by the holder after the return of the vehicle or after the lessee receives an itemized bill.

<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Except as otherwise provided by this section, any lessor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under the provisions of this chapter or for which no specific relief is provided with respect to any person shall be liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any actual damages sustained by such person as a result of the failure.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) In the case of an individual action, 25 percent of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease except that liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 or greater than $1,000;  or in the case of a class action, such amount as the court may allow, except that as to each member of the class no minimum recovery shall be applicable, and the total recovery in such action shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or one percent of the net worth of the lessor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) The costs of the action, together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In determining the amount of award in any class action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) The amount of any actual damages sustained.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) The frequency and persistence of failure of compliance by the lessor.

(c) The resources of the lessor.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) The number of persons adversely affected.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) The extent to which the lessor's failure of compliance was intentional.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. A lessor shall not be liable under this section if within 30 days after discovery of an error, and prior to the institution of an action under this section or the receipt of written notice of the error, the lessor notifies the person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account are necessary to insure that the person will not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount that should correctly have been charged.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. A lessor shall not be held liable in any action brought under this section for a violation of this chapter if the lessor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance or procedures reasonably adopted to avoid any such error.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, any civil action for a violation of this chapter which may be brought against the original lessor in any lease transaction may be maintained against any subsequent assignee of the original lessor where the violation from which the alleged liability arose is apparent on the face of the instrument assigned unless the assignment is involuntary.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A person shall not take any action to offset any amount for which a lessor is potentially liable to such person under subparagraph I(b) of this section against any amount owing to such lessor by such person, unless the amount of the lessor's liability to such person has been determined by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action to which such person was a party.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. No provision of this section imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith conformity with any rule, regulation or interpretation of state or federal law, notwithstanding that after such act or omission has occurred, such rule, regulation or interpretation is amended, rescinded or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. The multiple failure to disclose any information required under this chapter to be disclosed in connection with a single lease transaction shall entitle the person to a single recovery under this section, but continued failure to disclose after a recovery has been granted shall give rise to rights to additional recoveries.
