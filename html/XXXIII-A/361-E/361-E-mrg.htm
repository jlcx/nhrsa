&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-E:5 Cancellation. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Guaranteed asset protection waiver agreements may be cancellable or noncancellable after the free look period.  GAP waivers shall provide that if a borrower cancels a waiver within the free look period, the borrower shall be entitled to a full refund of the purchase price, if no benefits have been provided.  The free look period shall not be less than 30 days.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. In the event of a borrower's cancellation of the GAP waiver after the agreement has been in effect beyond the free look period, the borrower may be entitled to a refund of any unearned portion of the purchase price of the GAP waiver unless the GAP waiver provides otherwise.  In order to receive a refund, the borrower shall, in accordance with the terms of the waiver, provide a written request to cancel to the creditor, administrator, or other such party.  If the GAP waiver is being cancelled due to the early termination of the finance agreement, the borrower shall provide a written request to the creditor, administrator, or other party, within 90 days of the event terminating the finance agreement.  No refund shall be paid or credited if benefits have been provided.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any cancellation refund under paragraphs I, II, or III, may be applied by the creditor as a reduction of the amount owed under the finance agreement, unless the borrower can show that the finance agreement has been paid in full.
