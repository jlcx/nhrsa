&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The buyer may cancel by written notice mailed to the seller, preferably by certified or registered letter, or he may cancel by returning the merchandise in person within the cancellation period.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b-1) If the buyer cancels the transaction in accordance with this chapter, and within the cancellation period the seller has performed services or has performed work that has physically altered the property of the buyer, the buyer shall be entitled to a refund of all funds transferred to the seller, and the seller shall not be entitled to deduct the value of such services or work from the refund.  In the alternative, if the seller has performed work that has physically altered the property of the buyer and it can be reasonably restored to its original condition, the buyer may demand, in lieu of a refund, full restoration of the property to its original condition.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) After cancellation, provided the seller has returned to the buyer all payments, goods (or their trade-in value), other property, notes or any other evidence of indebtedness, the seller is then entitled to receive within the same 15 day period, in substantially the same condition as delivered, any goods, merchandise or other property which was received by the buyer from the seller.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Notwithstanding paragraphs I and II, the buyer and seller, upon mutual agreement, may negotiate for repair, replacement, substitution or credit allowance during the 15 day period.
