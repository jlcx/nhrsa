&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-A:2 Licensing of Sales Finance Companies and Retail Sellers Required. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. No person shall engage in the business of a sales finance company or retail seller in this state without a license therefor as provided in this chapter.  Persons subject to this chapter shall be responsible for the supervision of their employees, agents, and branch offices.  No state or federally chartered bank, savings bank, trust company, credit union, cooperative bank, or industrial bank shall be required to obtain such a license but shall comply with the provisions of RSA 361-A:7-12, unless otherwise exempted in this chapter.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. (a) The application for such license shall be in writing and verified on a form prescribed by the commissioner.  The application shall contain the name of the applicant;  the tax applicant's identification number;  date of incorporation, if incorporated;  the address where the business is or is to be conducted and similar information as to any branch office of the applicant;  the trade name, if any, under which the applicant proposes to conduct such business;  and such other pertinent information as the commissioner may require.  The application shall include a list of the names and resident addresses of principals and the name of any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions.  Each principal shall provide his or her social security numbers and shall authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The applicant shall submit any other information that the commissioner may require including, but not limited to, the applicant's form and place of organization, the applicant's proposed method of doing business, the qualifications and business history of the applicant and those persons listed in the application, and in the case of sales finance companies, the applicant's financial condition and history.  The applicant shall disclose if any injunction or administrative order has been issued against the applicant or any of its principals listed in the application and whether the applicant or any of its principals have been convicted of a misdemeanor involving financial services or a financial services-related business, or any fraud, false statements or omissions, theft or any wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, or a conspiracy to commit any of these offenses, or convicted of any felony, prior to the commissioner's approval of such change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Unless the applicant is a publicly traded corporation, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on the applicant's principals and any person in a similar position or performing similar functions.  If the applicant is a subsidiary, the department shall complete a background investigation and criminal history records check on individuals who are indirect owners.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The persons described in subparagraph II(a) shall submit to the department a notarized criminal history records release form, as provided by the New Hampshire division of state police, which authorizes the release of the person's criminal records, if any.  The person shall submit with the release form a complete set of fingerprints taken by a qualified law enforcement agency or an authorized employee of the banking department.  In the event that the first set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, a second set of fingerprints is necessary in order to complete the criminal history records check.  If, after 2 attempts, a set of fingerprints is invalid due to insufficient pattern, the department may, in lieu of the criminal history records check, accept police clearances from every city, town, or county where the person has lived during the past 5 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) The department shall submit the criminal history records release form to the New Hampshire division of state police which shall conduct a criminal history records check through its records and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the division of state police shall release copies of the criminal conviction records to the department.  The department shall maintain the confidentiality of all criminal history records information received pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) The department may require the applicant or licensee to pay the actual costs of each background investigation and criminal history records check.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) The department may rely on criminal records checks reported through a national licensing facility in lieu of (2) and (3) above.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Every applicant for licensing under this chapter shall file with the commissioner, in such form as the commissioner prescribes by rule, irrevocable consent appointing the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process in any non-criminal suit, action, or proceeding against the applicant or the applicant's successor, executor, or administrator which arises under this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent.  A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous registration need not file another.  When any person, including any nonresident of this state, engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, and such person has not filed a consent to service of process under this section and personal jurisdiction over such person cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to such person's appointment of the commissioner to receive service of any lawful process.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner along with $5, but is not effective unless:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) The plaintiff, who may be the attorney general in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him or her, forthwith sends a notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at such person's last address on file with the commissioner;  and
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this paragraph is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If a person holds a valid license under this section and is in compliance with this chapter and the rules thereunder, such licensee may renew the license by paying the required fee to the banking department on or before December 1 for the ensuing year that begins on January 1.  Failure to renew the license shall result in the license terminating on December 31.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Sales finance company license applicants shall at the same time file with the commissioner a $25,000 surety bond to the state for the use of the state and any person who may have a cause of action against the principal in the bond under the provisions of this chapter, and conditioned that the principal will conform to and abide by each provision of this chapter and will pay to the state and to any such person any sum that may become due or owing under this chapter from the principal of the bond to the state or to such person.  Recovery against the bond may be made by the state after due notice and hearing in accordance with the provisions of RSA 541-A, and by any such person who may have obtained a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction naming said principal.  The surety bond shall be continuous and shall include a provision requiring the surety to give written notice to the commissioner 20 days in advance of the cancellation or termination of the bond.  Every bond shall provide that no recovery may be made against the bond unless the state makes a claim for recovery or the person brings suit naming the principal within 6 years after the act upon which the recovery or suit is based.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Each initial and renewal retail seller application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $50 for the principal place of business of the licensee and the sum of $30 for each branch of such licensee maintained in this state.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. Sums collected under this chapter shall be payable to the state treasurer as restricted revenue and credited to the appropriation for the commissioner, consumer credit administration division.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Each license shall specify the location of the office or branch and shall be conspicuously displayed there in a public area.  In case such location is changed, the commissioner shall endorse the change of location on the license without charge.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. (a) Upon the filing of the complete application for a sales finance company license and payment of the required application fee, if the commissioner determines that the applicant's financial resources and responsibility, experience, personnel, and record of past or proposed conduct warrant the public's confidence and that the business will be operated lawfully, honestly, and fairly within the purposes of this chapter, the commissioner shall enter an order approving such application and shall issue a license to the applicant and shall issue licenses to the applicant's branches to engage in the business of a sales finance company under and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  Each sales finance company license shall expire on December 31 of each calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Upon the filing of a complete application for a retail seller license and payment of the required application fee, if the commissioner determines that the applicant's experience and record of past or proposed conduct warrant the public's confidence and that the business will be operated lawfully, honestly and fairly within the purposes of this chapter, the commissioner shall enter an order approving such application and shall issue a license to the applicant and shall issue licenses to the applicant's branches to engage in the business of a retail seller under and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  Each retail seller license shall expire on December 31 of each calendar year.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) No license issued under this chapter shall be transferable or assignable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
X. No license shall be issued to any person whose principal place of business is located outside of this state unless that person designates an agent residing within this state for service of process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XI. Each license issued under the provisions of this chapter shall state the name and address of the principal office of the licensee and, if the license is a branch office license, the name and address of the branch office location for which that license is issued.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XII. Retail sellers and sales finance companies licensed under this chapter are under a continuing obligation to update information on file with the commissioner.  If any information filed with the commissioner becomes materially inaccurate, the retail seller and sales finance company licensee shall promptly submit an amendment to its application records to correct the information on file with the commissioner.  An amendment shall be considered to be filed promptly if the amendment is filed within 30 days of the event that requires the filing of the amendment.  Certain significant events as defined by rule shall be reported to the department in writing within 10 calendar days.  A licensee shall submit written notification to the department of the addition or deletion of a person required to be listed in the application, and shall provide the name and address of each new person required to be listed no later than 30 days after such change.  Each new person required to be listed shall provide his or her social security number and authorize the commissioner to conduct a background check.  The commissioner shall investigate management and ownership changes including, but not limited to, the qualifications and business history of each person required to be listed.  The licensee shall investigate and disclose any injunction or administrative order that has been issued against the person required to be listed and whether the person required to be listed has been convicted of a misdemeanor involving financial services or a financial services-related business, or any fraud, false statements or omissions, theft or any wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, or a conspiracy to commit any of these offenses, or convicted of any felony, prior to the commissioner's approval of such change.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIII. The fact that a person is licensed or registered in the state of New Hampshire under this chapter does not constitute a finding that the commissioner has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of such person or that the commissioner has recommended or given approval to any person.  It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XIV. Any license fee required by this chapter shall be paid before a license may become effective.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
XV. The commissioner may license or register individuals or firms by means of or through the facilities of a national organization which facilitates registration and licensing on a nationwide basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-A:3 Suspension or Revocation of Licenses. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may issue an order requiring a person to whom any license has been granted or any person under the commissioner's jurisdiction to show cause why the license should not be revoked or penalties should not be imposed, or both, for violations of this chapter.  The order shall give reasonable notice of the opportunity for a hearing and shall state the reasons for the issuance of the order.  The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend any license or application pending final determination of any order to show cause, or other order, or of any other proceeding under this section, provided the commissioner finds that the public interest would be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing such order.  Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the respondent, applicant, or licensee that the order has been entered and of the reasons for the order and that within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for a hearing.  Valid delivery of such order shall be by hand or certified mail at the last known principal office of the licensee or respondent or to an officer, director, 5 percent or more owner, member, partner, or legal representative of the licensee or respondent.  If the person to whom an order to show cause or other order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of the order and no hearing is ordered by the commissioner, then such person shall be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.  A hearing, if requested, shall be scheduled not later than 10 calendar days after the written request for such hearing is received by the commissioner, after which and within 20 calendar days from the date of the hearing the commissioner shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require.  If the licensee or respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt or valid delivery of such order or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, or cannot be located after a reasonable search, such person shall be deemed in default and the proceeding may be decided against the person upon consideration of the order to show cause, or other order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I-a. The commissioner may, by order, deny, suspend, or revoke any license or application and bar any person from licensure if the commissioner finds that the order is in the public interest and the applicant, respondent, or licensee, any partner, officer, member, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, respondent, or licensee:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Has filed an application for licensing which as of its effective date, or as of any date after filing in the case of an order denying effectiveness, was incomplete in any material respect or contained any statement which was, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Has made a false or misleading statement to the commissioner or in any reports to the commissioner;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Has made fraudulent misrepresentations, has circumvented or concealed, through whatever subterfuge or device, any of the material particulars required to be stated or furnished to a borrower under the provisions of this chapter;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Has failed to supervise its agents, managers, or employees;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(e) Is the subject of an order entered within the past 5 years by this state, any other state, or federal regulator denying, suspending, or revoking licenses or registration;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(f) Is permanently, preliminarily, or temporarily enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice involving any aspect of lending or collection activities;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(g) Is not qualified on the basis of such factors as experience, knowledge, and financial integrity;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(h) Has engaged in dishonest or unethical practices in the conduct of making retail installment transactions or collecting on retail installment contracts;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) Has violated this chapter or any rule or order thereunder or has violated applicable federal laws or rules thereunder;
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(j) Has made an unsworn falsification under RSA 641:3 to the commissioner;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(k) For other good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If a licensee is a partnership, association, corporation, or entity however organized it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership has so acted or failed to act in behalf of said licensee as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.  Each licensee shall be responsible for supervision of its branch offices and for the acts of any or all of his or her employees while acting as his or her agent if such licensee, after actual knowledge of said acts, retained the benefits, proceeds, profits, or advantages accruing from said acts or otherwise ratified said acts.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any license revocation, suspension, or unfavorable action by the department on a license shall comply with the provisions of RSA 541-A.  An aggrieved licensee may, pursuant to RSA 541-A and RSA 541, appeal an unfavorable action by the department.  The department may take action for immediate suspension of a license, pursuant to RSA 541-A.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If the commissioner finds that any licensee or applicant for license is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a retail seller or sales finance company, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order revoke the license, impose penalties, or deny the application.  The commissioner may deem abandoned and withdraw any application for licensure made pursuant to this chapter, if any applicant fails to respond in writing within 180 calendar days to a written request from the commissioner requesting a response.  Such request shall be sent via certified mail to the last known address of the applicant that is on file with the commissioner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-A:3-a Cease and Desist Orders. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Whenever the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that any person is engaging in the business of a sales finance company or retail seller without obtaining a license as provided in this chapter, or has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter, or any rule or order under this chapter, the commissioner may, in addition to all actions provided for in this chapter, enter an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such violation.  Delivery of such order shall be by hand or registered mail at the principal office of the licensee or other person.  The order shall be calculated to give reasonable notice of the rights of the person to request a hearing on the order and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order.  A hearing shall be held not later than 10 days after the request for such hearing is received by the commissioner after which and within 20 days of the date of the hearing the commissioner shall issue a further order vacating the cease and desist order or making it permanent as the facts require.  All hearings shall comply with RSA 541-A.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, the person shall be deemed in default, and the proceeding may be decided against him or her upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.  If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt of such order, then such person shall likewise be deemed in default, and the order shall, on the thirty-first day, become permanent, and shall remain in full force and effect until and unless later modified or vacated by the commissioner, for good cause shown.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If any person refuses to obey such order, an action may be brought by the commissioner or by the attorney general on the commissioner's behalf in any superior court in this state to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation.  In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding a temporary or permanent injunction, and awarding the commissioner or the attorney general or both costs in bringing such action.  The court shall have the power to enforce obedience to such injunction, in addition to all the court's customary powers, by a fine not exceeding $10,000 or by imprisonment, or both.

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The commissioner may examine the business affairs of any sales finance company licensee or any other person, whether licensed or not, as the commissioner deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to it.  In determining compliance, the banking department may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents, whether electronically stored or otherwise, and any other matters of any sales finance company licensee or person.  The banking department shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceeding, and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, whether electronically stored or otherwise, and other documents and materials relevant to its investigation.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. The affairs and records of every sales finance company licensee or person shall be subject at any time to periodic, special, regular, or other examination by the banking department with or without notice to the licensee or person.  Those licensees or persons that maintain their files and business documents in another state shall appoint a New Hampshire agent and shall return such files and documents to such agent, or to their principal New Hampshire office, or to the banking department for examination no later than 21 calendar days after being requested to do so by the banking department.  When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21 day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.  Failure to provide files and documents within 60 days after being requested to do so by the banking department shall be sufficient cause for license revocation, suspension, or denial.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. Any agent of the banking department may make a thorough examination into the business affairs of any sales finance company licensee or person and shall report any violations of law, rule, or standard business practice to the banking department.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The expense of such examination shall be chargeable to and paid by the sales finance company licensee or person.  The payment shall be calculated by the same method as for payments by institutions for cost of examinations under RSA 383:11, except when the principal office of the licensee or person is located outside of this state and the department has determined that the examination must be conducted at that out-of-state location, the actual cost of travel, lodging, meals, and other expenses of examination personnel making the examination, shall be chargeable to and paid by such licensee or person in addition to the per diem charge for examination personnel set forth in RSA 383:11.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a sales finance company, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in subparagraph (a), or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, thereto as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in subparagraph (a).  The report shall be accepted and filed within 6 months after final hearing.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) All reports pursuant to this section shall be privileged and although filed in the department as provided in subparagraph (b) shall not be for public inspection.  The comments and recommendations of the examiner shall also be confidential information and shall not be available for public inspection.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. In any investigation to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter, upon the commissioner's finding that the person violated this chapter or a rule or order under this chapter, or the person charged with the violation being found in default, the commissioner shall be entitled to recover the cost of the investigation, in addition to any other penalty provided for under this chapter.

(i) The time balance, which is the sum of (g) and (h), payable in installments by the buyer, the number of installments, the amount of each installment and the due date or period thereof.
<br>
The above subparagraphs in paragraph II need not be stated in the sequence or order set forth.  Additional paragraphs may be included to explain the calculations involved in determining the stated time balance to be paid by the buyer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. The amount, if any, included for insurance, which may be purchased by or protects the holder of the retail installment contract, shall not exceed the applicable premiums chargeable in accordance with the rates filed with the insurance commissioner.  If dual interest insurance on the motor vehicle is purchased by the holder, the holder shall, within 30 days after execution of the retail installment contract, send or cause to be sent to the buyer a policy or policies or certificate of insurance, written by an insurance company authorized to do business in this state, clearly setting forth the amount of the premium, the kind or kinds of insurance, the coverages and all the terms, exceptions, limitations, restrictions and conditions of the contract or contracts of insurance.  The buyer shall have the privilege of purchasing insurance from an agent or broker of the buyer's own selection authorized by the insurance commissioner to do business in the state, but in such case the inclusion of the dual interest insurance premium in the retail installment contract shall be optional with the seller.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. If any insurance is cancelled, unearned insurance premium refunds received by the holder shall be credited to the final maturing installments of the contract except to the extent applied toward payment for similar insurance protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder or either of them.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV-a. If a retail installment contract is paid in full prior to maturity, then no later than 30 days after payment in full, the holder of the contract shall provide written notice of such payment to any insurance company that has issued an insurance contract the premium of which was financed as part of such retail installment contract.  Such notice shall contain the date the retail installment contract was paid in full, the name and last known address of the buyer under the contract, and shall state that pursuant to RSA 361-A a refund by the insurer of any unused prepaid premium is due the buyer upon receipt of the notice.  A copy of the notice shall be given to the buyer, or mailed to the buyer's last known address.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. The holder may, if the contract so provides, collect a single delinquency and collection charge on each installment in default for a period not less than 10 days in an amount not in excess of 5 percent of the installment in default.  In addition to such delinquency and collection charge, the contract may provide for the payment of reasonable attorneys' fees where such contract is referred for collection to an attorney not a salaried employee of the holder of the contract plus the court costs and the financier's out-of-pocket collection expenses.  The pyramiding of delinquency or the collection of unfair late charges as prohibited in Federal Reserve Regulation AA, 12 C.F.R. 227.15, as amended from time to time, is prohibited.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. No retail installment contract shall be signed by any party thereto when it contains blank spaces to be filled in after it has been signed;  except that, if delivery of the motor vehicle is not made at the time of the execution of the contract, the identifying numbers or marks of the motor vehicle or similar information, and the due date of the first installment, may be inserted in the contract after its execution;  and except that said contract may be so signed provided the buyer is given at the time of such execution a bill of sale, invoice or similar memorandum clearly indicating the sales price, down payment, type or types of insurance coverage and the number, period and amount of payments;  and provided said contract when completed conforms with said bill of sale, invoice or memorandum, and a copy of said contract is delivered to said buyer subject to adjustment only with reference to final closeout figure for any outstanding balance on a car traded in.  The buyer's written acknowledgment, conforming to the requirements of subparagraph I(c), of delivery of a copy of a contract shall be conclusive proof of such delivery, that the contract when signed did not contain any blank spaces except as provided, and of compliance with this section in any action or proceeding by or against the seller or the holder of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. Within 5 business days of receipt of written request from the buyer, the holder of a retail installment contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written statement of the dates and amounts of payments or the total amount unpaid under such contract, or both, as specified in the request.  A buyer shall be given a written or stamped receipt for any payment when made in cash.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VIII. A provision in a retail installment contract (1) for confession of judgment, power of attorney therefor, or wage assignment;  (2) for the subsequent inclusion of title to or lien upon any goods, other than the motor vehicle which is the subject matter of the retail installment sale or accessories therefor or special or auxiliary equipment used in connection therewith, or in substitution, in whole or in part, for any such accessory or special or auxiliary equipment, as security for payment of the total time price;  (3) whereby, in the absence of the buyer's default, the holder may accelerate the maturity of any part of all of the time balance;  (4) whereby a seller or holder of the contract, or other person acting on his behalf, is authorized to enter the buyer's premises unlawfully, or to commit any breach of the peace in the repossession of a motor vehicle;  (5) whereby the buyer waives any right of action against the seller or holder of the contract, or other person acting on his behalf, for any illegal act committed in the collection of payments under the contract or in the repossession of the motor vehicle;  (6) whereby the buyer executes a power of attorney appointing the seller or holder of the contract, or other person acting on his behalf, as the buyer's agent in the collection of payments under the contract or in the repossession of the motor vehicle;  or (7) whereby the seller is relieved from liability for any legal remedies which the buyer may have had against the seller under the contract, or any separate instrument executed in connection therewith, shall not be enforceable.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IX. The following provisions are prohibited in retail installment contracts and shall not be enforceable:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(a) Any provision permitting the holder to waive the buyer's right to notice of default.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Any provision permitting the holder to accelerate the principal balance under the contract for default for any cause other than:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Non-payment of any amount due under the terms of the contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Failure to insure the vehicle which secures the contract against loss, if such insurance is required by the terms of the contract.  Provided, however, that the holder may not accelerate the principal balance solely as a result of the failure to insure until the holder gives the buyer written notice conspicuously stating that the buyer has the opportunity to cure the default under this subparagraph by submitting proof of insurance to the holder within 15 days of the mailing of the notice.  If no proof of insurance is submitted to the holder within 15 days of mailing of notice, the holder may accelerate the principal balance.  This subparagraph shall not apply if the contract obligates the holder to purchase such insurance and collect the premiums for the insurance from the buyer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Removal of the collateral from the United States or Canada without the holder's permission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(4) Sale, rental, lease, or other transfer of an interest in the collateral without the holder's permission.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(5) Commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy by or against the buyer.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(6) Other significant impairment of the realization of the collateral, limited to seizure of the vehicle by law enforcement officials, encumbrance of the vehicle, abandonment of the vehicle, or loss, theft, or destruction of the vehicle that is not covered by insurance.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) Any provisions permitting the holder to:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(1) Declare the note in default prior to 10 days following failure to make any installment payment due;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(2) Add any charge for vehicle repairs to the principal balance of the contract after the contract has been executed;  or
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(3) Assess a prepayment penalty on a contract with a term of less than 6 years.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any provision under which a buyer waives any right, benefit, or privilege which is conferred upon the buyer under this chapter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-A:8 Finance Charge. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the finance charge on any retail installment contract under this chapter shall be such as may be agreed upon by the buyer and the seller or by the buyer and the sales finance company.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Such finance charge shall be computed on the principal balance as determined under paragraph II of RSA 361-A:7 on contracts payable in successive monthly payments substantially equal in amount.  Such finance charge may be computed on the basis of a full month for any fractional month period in excess of 10 days.  A minimum finance charge of $25 may be charged on any retail installment transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. When a retail installment contract provides for unequal or irregular installment payments, the finance charge may be at the effective rates permitted in paragraph I, having due regard for the schedule of payments so that the finance charge may provide the same yield as is permitted in a regular payment transaction.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. Any sales finance company may purchase or acquire or agree to purchase or acquire from any seller any contract on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between them.  Filing of the assignment, notice to the buyer of the assignment, and any requirement that the holder maintain dominion over the payments or the motor vehicle if repossessed shall not be necessary to the validity of a written assignment of a contract as against creditors, subsequent purchasers, pledgees, mortgagees and lien claimants of the seller.  Unless the buyer has notice of the assignment of his contract, payment thereunder made by the buyer to the last known holder of such contract shall be binding upon all subsequent holders.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 361-A:8-a Balloon Payment Loans. &#150;</b>
<codesect>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. The general court recognizes that both borrowers and lenders may wish to have balloon retail installment contracts available as a credit option for the purchase of motor vehicles.  The general court also recognizes the potential for confusion or misunderstanding by borrowers of the nature and terms of balloon retail installment contracts, and for misleading lending practices.  To this end, the general court hereby authorizes the making of balloon retail installment contracts and authorizes the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541-A to protect borrowers from misleading lending practices.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 361-A:8, III, a retail installment contract for a new motor vehicle may provide for a balloon payment.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
III. (a) Balloon contracts shall contain a provision requiring the lienholder to accept return of the motor vehicle that secures the balloon loan, without penalty or additional cost, payment, or expense, to the retail buyer in satisfaction of the balloon payment due under the balloon contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(b) Collection of any amounts due under the terms of the balloon contract that have accrued during the period of the contract that precedes the balloon payment due date shall not violate the provision contained in subparagraph (a).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(c) If the balloon contract so provides, a disposition fee may be charged to the retail buyer, provided such fee does not exceed $250, or such greater or lesser amount announced by the commissioner to annually adjust the disposition fee based upon changes in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, all items category, of consumer prices compiled and reported by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(d) Any cost to the retail buyer associated with the return of a motor vehicle under a balloon contract pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the total of the disposition fee, excess mileage fee, excess wear and tear fee, if any, and any accrued amounts due in accordance with subparagraph (b).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
IV. The commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, to implement the purpose and requirements of this section, including, but not limited to, balloon contract disclosures and balloon payment refinancing disclosures.  Any disclosures required by rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph shall be in addition to disclosures required by the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
V. Balloon retail installment contracts shall contain a provision that affords retail buyers the option to refinance the balloon payment at an annual percentage rate no greater than the annual percentage rate under the balloon contract.  Creditors under this paragraph shall be entitled to deny a refinance request if the retail buyer would not have been eligible for the balloon contract, based on credit history or other credit underwriting standards established by written policy of the creditor.  The creditor's credit underwriting standards for refinancing a balloon payment shall be substantially identical to the underwriting standards used by the creditor when the creditor issued a commitment to the borrower to fund the original balloon retail installment contract.  Refinancing of balloon payments shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.  The contract evidencing such refinancing shall be deemed a retail installment contract.  An estimate of the monthly payment amount for a refinanced balloon payment shall be provided in writing by the creditor to the retail buyer upon the buyer's request.  Applications for balloon contracts shall include a notice in at least 10 point bold type that the balloon contract applicant is entitled, upon request, to receive a written estimate of the monthly payment amount for a balloon payment refinancing in accordance with the creditor's then existing refinance programs prior to entering into a balloon contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VI. A sales finance company may charge an excess mileage fee associated with a motor vehicle that is returned to the lienholder pursuant to paragraph III of this section, provided that no such fee shall be charged when the odometer of the motor vehicle securing the balloon contract indicates the vehicle was driven less than the maximum mileage limit set forth in the balloon contract.  Any excess mileage charges payable by the retail buyer shall be clearly set forth in the balloon contract.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
VII. A lienholder may assess a fee for excess wear and tear associated with a motor vehicle returned pursuant to paragraph III of this section.  Any charges for excess wear and tear payable by the retail buyer shall be clearly set forth in the balloon contract.
