&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I. A licensee shall keep and use business records in such form and at such location as the commissioner shall by rule determine.  The records shall enable the commissioner to determine whether the licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter, any rules adopted under it, and any other law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  The rules may contain provisions for records to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by any process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original record or document, or in any other form or manner authorized by the commissioner.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit any licensee to destroy original records or documents.  Each licensee shall preserve all such business records for as long a period as the commissioner shall prescribe by rule.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
II. If the commissioner or examiner finds any business records to be inadequate, or kept or posted in a manner not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the commissioner may employ experts to reconstruct, rewrite, post, or balance them at the expense of the person being examined if such person has failed to maintain, complete, or correct such business records after the commissioner or examiner has given him or her written notice and a reasonable opportunity to do so.
