The commissioner may examine the business affairs of any sales finance company licensee or any other person, whether licensed or not, as the commissioner deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to it.  In determining compliance, the banking department may examine the books, accounts, records, files, and other documents, whether electronically stored or otherwise, and any other matters of any sales finance company licensee or person.  The banking department shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths in any adjudicative proceeding, and to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of all books, records, files, whether electronically stored or otherwise, and other documents and materials relevant to its investigation.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. The affairs and records of every sales finance company licensee or person shall be subject at any time to periodic, special, regular, or other examination by the banking department with or without notice to the licensee or person.

When the commissioner requests a list of New Hampshire consumers who have contracted with the licensee or other similar summary document from a licensee from which to select particular files for review, the licensee shall ensure that the list is received by the commissioner within 7 calendar days and return the files selected by the commissioner to the commissioner within 14 calendar days to ensure compliance with the 21 day requirement.  Failure to provide files and documents within the time established by this paragraph shall subject a licensee or person to a fine of $50 per day for each day after 21 days the files and documents are not produced.

The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accept all or a part of a report of examination of a sales finance company, certified to by the regulatory supervisory official of another state.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the commissioner, insofar as he or she deems it practicable in administering this section, may cooperate with the regulators of other states, the Federal Trade Commission, other federal regulators, or their successors in conducting examinations and investigations.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspV. Every person being examined, and all of the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of such person shall make freely available to the commissioner or his or her examiners the accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(a) Upon receipt of a written report of examination, the licensee shall have 30 days or such additional reasonable period as the commissioner for good cause may allow, within which to review the report, recommend any changes and set forth in writing the remedial course of action the licensee will pursue to correct any reported deficiencies outlined in the report.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(b) If so requested by the person examined, within the period allowed in subparagraph (a), or if deemed advisable by the commissioner without such request, the commissioner shall hold a closed hearing relative to the report and shall not file the report in the department until after such closed hearing and issuance of his or her order thereon.  If no such closed hearing has been requested or held, the examination report, with such modifications, if any, thereto as the commissioner deems proper, shall be accepted by the commissioner and filed upon expiration of the review period provided for in subparagraph (a).
